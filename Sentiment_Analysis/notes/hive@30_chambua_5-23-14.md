##SENTIMENT ANALYSIS (5/23/14)
------
###Some ideas
Difference segments, 


centralization quality based on the rate calculation

not really significant to show relationships but it might be significant to tag them as positive or negative.

Possibly using poderpedia, miguel sent me notes, will check on this more and pursue some demo visuals for next week:

###Questions
what should i do about the bum articles?
- process (aggrey will tell me patterns)

should i rectify with eva's findings or build an independant visualization?

what would you like to do about counts? there should be a way to show the difference in article density over time?

we should go over any issues in my [hiv@30_chambua_5_20_14 notes](https://github.com/internews-ke/hiv-30/blob/master/Sentiment_Analysis/notes/hiv%4030_chambua_5-20-14.md).

###1980s
* places go from global to local (international > Nairobi)
* people become increasingly local doctors in the news, as opposed to international institutions like the CDC and other "foreign" doctors (french, european)
* In 1988 for example, we see mention of more Kenyan institutions (Kenya Trypanosomiasis Research Institute, University of Nairobi, Kenya Medical Research)
* This might mean that the disease is taken more seriously locally but probably also means that the media bias has begun to address the medical opinion of local authorities
* Later (late 80s) news coverage addresses more "family planning" and "women's" associations as aids is viewed more in the context of prevention as opposed to hysteria and accusation

###1990s
* 1990s (1992) we see use of medical terms (acquired immuno-deficiency institutions) and a greater diversity of african countries (uganda, zambia) as well as kenya
* observations similar to 1980s but MANY more articles per year
* there's a resurgnce of foreign institution involvement but a comparative growth in African doctors' mentioned too
* might be interesting to show how the conversation grows, literally, since the number of entities referenced relative to HIV expands greatly in the 1990s
* we might also want to weight the graphs to illustrate this increased density of articles and information.
