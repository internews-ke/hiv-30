{"text": "May 2,\u00a02013\nPending Bill \u2018key in Aids fight\u2019\nBy SAMUEL SIRINGI ssiringi@ke.nationmedia.com\nA Bill pending in Parliament could heavily cut down on new Aids infections.\nAnd Parliament has been asked to give priority to the Bill, whose enactment into law will boost the fight against new infections.\nNational Aids Control Council director Alloys Orago suggests that the parliamentary committee on health, once formed, should speed up debate on the Kenya National Aids Commission Bill, 2012.\n\u201cWe are requesting them to consider the Bill urgent as it will fast-track our activities as we move to the county governments,\u201d Prof Orago said in an interview.\nFormer Health Committee chairman Robert Monda introduced the Bill in the last Parliament, but it could only go through the first reading as MPs ran out of time.\n\u201cWe are not blaming anybody but we think it is good for us to think about coming up with a law that can help ease a burden so heavy for the country,\u201d said Prof Orago.\nGuide new activities\nThe Bill proposes the establishment of a Kenya National Aids Commission that will replace NACC.\nIt will set up offices at county headquarters and in other regions and help mobilise resources for HIV/Aids control and prevention.\nThe Bill would also provide a legal framework for conducting HIV/Aids programmes.\nProf Orago\u2019s remarks were echoed by the council\u2019s head of communications, Ms Jennifer Wambua.\nMs Wambua said the new Bill, if passed into law, would open the way for implementation of a new county plan to significantly reduce new infections.\nShe said that the commission was already conducting HIV/Aids profiles for all the 47 counties to guide new activities under the devolved system of governance.\nAccording to current statistics in the Kenya Demographic and Health Survey, the national HIV prevalence rates stood at 6.3 per cent in 2009, translating to about 1.5 million people.\nThe figure could change after the government completes an ongoing study \u2014 the Kenya Aids Indicator Survey.\nEstablish the prevalence\nThe survey seeks to establish the prevalence of HIV among those aged between 18 months and 14 years.\nIt will also look at HIV prevalence among those aged between 15 years and 64 years."}
