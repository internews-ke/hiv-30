Hope I don't get Aids. Just kidding. I'm white!\"\nMs Sacco works for InterActiveCorp (IAC), a giant media and Internet which owns dozens of brands including the Daily Beast, Vimeo, Dictionary.com, Match.com and Ask.com.\nIAC also owns the BlackPeopleMeet.com, a dating site for African-Americans.\nIn response to the remark and the online furore it raised, IAC responded by saying the \"outrageous, offensive comment\" did not reflect the company's views and values.\n\u201cUnfortunately, the employee in question is unreachable on an international flight, but this is a very serious matter and we are taking appropriate action,\u201d it added in a statement.\nThough Ms Sacco account has since been deleted, on Twitter, the hashtag #HasJustineLandedYet is still drawing ire worldwide. The hashtag is the most trending worldwide.\nYusuf Abramjee tweets: It's racist and misleading comments like these that fuel the perception that HIV/Aids only affects some #JustineSacco.\n@Cliff Weathers\u00a0\u200fJustine Sacco has a history of heartless, vile tweets. What's she like in real life? #HasJustineLandedYet\nThere were questions about whether Ms Sacco\u2019s account had been hacked by an unauthorised user.\n\"Before she got on a plane Friday, a tweet emerged from Sacco's account, a joke of such monumental stupidity that it was hard for many people to believe her account wasn't hacked,\" an op-ed article on Mashable said.\nThe New York Times said Ms Sacco\u2019s message was \"posted from London (seemingly from a location near Heathrow Airport\u2019s Terminal 5).\"\nThe offending Twitter message was, however, \"not the first eyebrow-raising post on the account that appears to belong to Ms Sacco,\" it said\nNew York Times quoted a a message from the account, that said: \"Chili- cucumber sandwiches- bad teeth. Back in London!\"\nIt indicated that the online furore, and the pre-emptive quick response by the IAC, showed social media's power to propel a story."}
