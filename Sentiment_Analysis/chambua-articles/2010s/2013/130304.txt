{"text": "March 4,\u00a02013\nNow my HIV-positive husband cheats on me, then assaults me\n44 \nadvertisement \nBy PHILIP KITOTO\nDear Kitoto,\nI am a staunch Christian, married for nine years. We have four children. When we first married, my husband was good to me and both of us were working. He lost his job after he tested positive for HIV. I tested negative.\nI stood by him and even paid his college fees. Neighbours thought he was back to work because he was always well-dressed and would use our car when I was at work.\nThe situation changed when I also lost my job. Apparently, he had a number of affairs and on further investigation, I found out that he also had several other children.\nHe has now returned to his violent ways. I remember that a year after our wedding, he beat me up. Seven years later, he hit me again and I almost miscarried. When he knocked me unconscious last week, I reported him to the police.\nHe does this in front of the children. His parents are separated. His father abused his mother and she left. His stepbrother is divorced and his stepsister keeps leaving the men she marries.\nI have asked my husband to give me Sh10,000 to start a business and he has refused. Last year, I started selling vegetables, but he brought down the stall. I will leave when I get a job so that I can take care of my children. I took an HIV test together with my children the other Thursday and we all tested negative.\nSusan"}
