{"text": "June 21,\u00a02013\nIt\u2019s life on the fast lane for youth who crave riches and fame\n1  \nBy FLORENCE BETT satmag@nationmedia.com\nMost young people would like to take short-cuts to richness \u2014 although they appreciate the long and hard work to wealth.\nA new survey shows a majority of the youth aged 15 to 25 years would prefer to become wealthy at the expense of education and profession.\nMore than 60 per cent of all the 1,301 respondents polled for the Consumer Insight study said they wished to become rich.\nThey believe having enough money is one of the best ways of leading a comfortable life, regardless of how the riches are amassed.\n\u201cMost dream of shortcuts to wealth,\u201d the study says.\nBut they are not all vain. The young people admire their parents more than renowned leaders and sports icons.\nThey also respect their parents most. One in every four youth respects the parent of their gender more than icons such as former South African President Nelson Mandela, US President Barack Obama or Kenyan athlete David Rudisha.\nSome 27 per cent of the respondents said they respect their fathers and mothers because of their achievements.\nThis is far higher than the 15 per cent males who admire President Obama.\nThe study also shows that young girls are more assertive about their rights and are increasingly challenging traditional gender roles.\nIt also shows that the youth use both sheng and vernacular in verbal communication rather than written languages.\n\u201cEnglish is more written than spoken,\u201d the study says.\nThe survey indicates that the youth are struggling to be financially independent, with only one in four living on their own income.\nOn average, the youth receive an \u2018income\u2019 of Sh1,500 from parents and guardians. This \u2018income\u2019 is spent mostly on transport, snacks, clothing and airtime.\nThe snacks, fast foods and lack of exercise have contributed to the excess weight gained, according to the survey.\nThe youth also prefer smart phones, which are among products that enhance their fulfilment and enjoyment.\nThey also give an image of being rich and living a comfortable life.\nThe study sampled youth in Nairobi, Mombasa, Nakuru, Kisumu, Eldoret, Nyeri and Meru.\nRegarding their health, 68 per cent of the youth blame fast foods and lack of exercise for their excessive weight gain.\nDespite this, only 66 per cent feel there is a need to watch their weight through regular exercise and a balanced diet.\n\u201cBody weight is a concern to most youth, particularly teens and post-teens. Fast food is the culprit; exercising and a balanced diet the solution,\u201d says the report.\nHalf of the youth who access the computer from home say they use it for Internet browsing, word processing and playing games.\n\u201cGiven the fast rate at which homes are acquiring computers in Kenya, and because the highest usage is Internet, in the near future this device will be a major medium of communication in homes,\u201d the survey says.\nAt 24 per cent, both males and females spend a lot of money on toiletries and cosmetics for personal use.\nThe taste and price of the purchases they make is a determinant when buying beverages and snacks.\n\u201cYouth seek products that facilitate enjoyment or help portray a good image, hence the experience the product delivers is more important than its cost.\u201d\nWith the exception of news and job adverts, both largely in print, the youth seek fun content, says the survey on their media habits."}
