{"text": "December 10,\u00a02013\nI pray you\u2019ll find peace to forgive yourself\nLast week, I told you about Celestine, who blamed herself for her mother\u2019s death. \nHer mother died soon after Celestine told her that she was HIV-positive, and therefore believed that she caused her death.\nBefore giving her mother the news, she first confronted her husband, John*. \n\u201cHe admitted that he was HIV-positive. He was even on antiretroviral therapy, but was afraid I would leave him if he told me the truth.\u201d Celestine just couldn\u2019t take the shock. \n\u201cHow could my own husband have and live with this condition and not tell me? \nHow could I ignore the drugs, yet they\u2019ve always been there on our bedroom table? All along, I believed they were for high blood pressure.\u201d\nCelestine felt sorry for herself and her young family. Mostly, she felt sorry for the two daughters she treasured for so long, and the one on the way. \n\u201cAnyway, I wasn\u2019t sure if the coming baby would survive. And then I had a brainwave. I knew this would take care of things. I felt relieved that finally I knew what to do in the helplessness of the moment.\u201d \nLAST CONVERSATION\nCelestine stayed behind, pretending to watch TV,\u00a0as her husband went to sleep. \n\u201cI called my mother, who lived upcountry. It must\u2019ve been past 11pm. Without beating around the bush, I told her that John and I have AIDS and we were going to die. I told her to please take care of my two daughters, and asked her to come for our household items since we were about to die.\u201d\nCelestine then hang up. \nWhen her mother called her a few minutes later, she was sobbing, and could barely talk, so she hang up. \nCelestine didn\u2019t sleep the whole night. She tried to reach her mother again, but her phone was off. \n\u201cI saw my burial and my children crying beside my grave. I saw everyone going home. But my lonely children headed to a lonely house in which they\u2019d remain condemned for the rest of their lives.\u201d\nIn the morning, her mother called again. She asked Celestine to visit her, so that they could talk more about the matter.\n\u201cI agreed, but that was the last time I talked to my mother. That evening she died.\u201d \nCelestine\u2019s other siblings didn\u2019t know about the mother-daughter disclosure conversation. \nIn their last conversation, and amidst sobs, her mother had asked God why he was so unfair - \u201cHow can my only good daughter get this disease?\u201d she had lamented\u2028Celestine knew her mother had been very devastated. \n\u201cDuring my mother\u2019s burial, I mourned. But unlike other mourners, I felt guilty of her death. I had millions of \u2018if only\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cIf only the nurse had been discreet. If only my husband had let me know about his status in good time. If only I had not reacted hastily. If only I didn\u2019t make that call. If only my mother would\u2019ve been asleep that time I made the call. If only \u2026\u201d\nGUILTY OF MURDER\nCelestine told me she wonders if people can tell she is a murderess.\n\u201cYour issue is difficult for me to deal with,\u201d I eventually told Celestine, and referred her to another institution for counselling.\nSometimes we think we who are HIV-infected have more serious problems than others. \nHowever, we should consider that our loved ones will undergo what we do when we learn about our status \u2013 disbelief, denial, shock \u2013 the works.\nIt\u2019s important that, before we convey such weighty news, we first digest it. \nIf you consider disclosing to the next person, you must be able to succinctly answer the following questions: \u201cWho?\u201d \u201cHow?\u201d \u201cWhen?\u201d \u201cWhere and why\u201d. Here\u2019s my take.\nIf you can\u2019t answer any of these questions, you\u2019re not ready to take that disclosure leap. Common sense dictates that you first handle the heat yourself. \nTo health practitioners, it\u2019s important how you disclose the news to your patient. Privacy and confidentiality are important. Please show some respect and consideration. \nSometimes a counsellor can weigh\u00a0if a client is ready or not for such results. If not, do more counselling until the client is ready.\nI know there are other Celestines out there. Take heart. Perhaps lives were destroyed because of how information was given. Still, don\u2019t look at your \u201cburied\u201d mistakes. \nInstead, aim to disclose the news better because now you know better. \nCelestine, I pray you\u2019ll find peace to forgive yourself."}
