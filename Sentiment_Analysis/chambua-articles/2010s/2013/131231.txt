{"text": "Alarm as kits for HIV tests run out \n31 December 2013, Nation\nPublic health facilities are facing a shortage of HIV-testing kits following delays in clearing a new consignment at the port of Mombasa, the Nation has established.\nThe government has not supplied the kits for the last one month, meaning testing centres will soon turn away people wishing to know their HIV status. \nDirector of National Aids and STI Control Programme (Nascop) Martin Sirengo confirmed the shortage on Monday, adding that it was due to a technicality that occurred during the clearing of their consignment at the port.\nHe said the cargo containing the kits failed to be cleared because its levy had not been cleared. The levy is normally 1.5 per cent of the total cost of the cargo.\n\u201cThe kits are already here, only that the levy had not been paid. We have, however, agreed with the port to take the kits pending payment,\u201d Dr Sirengo told Nation. \nIt was feared that the two major donors of the kits\u2014 the Global Fund and USaid\u2014 had withdrawn their support to the government.\nDr Sirengo said the government had received three million kits from Global Fund while USaid will bring in another 10 million kits early January.\u00a0 \nSome public hospitals have started turning away people wishing to know their HIV status, while the rest plan to do the same from next week.\nThe looming crisis is likely to deal a big blow to the war on HIV and Aids and put the health of many, especially unborn children, at risk. \nEarly detection of the virus among pregnant women helps in the prevention of mother-to-child transmission.\nThe shortage if not averted will also cripple the government\u2019s efforts to reduce new infections to zero.\nThe looming crisis comes at a time when the government is encouraging Kenyans to know their status and protect themselves from infections. Many are likely to go for testing after December festivities."}
