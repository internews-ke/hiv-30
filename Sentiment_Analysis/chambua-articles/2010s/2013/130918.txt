{"text": "This is my take on\nfaith healing, again\nI AM WRITING TO clear my name\nfrom the black book. This is because\nwhen I wrote about one of my lowest\nmoments, it did not sit well with some\nreaders. I shared about how 20-plus\nyears ago, I went for Reinhard Bonnke\u2019s\nhealing crusade in Kisumu, but I did\nnot get the healing I was looking for.\nSince I am already in the black books,\nthere is no room for more. Some readers\ntold me that I lied. That I went for\nthe crusade to get healing and I got my\ncomeuppance. Some told me I should\nnot rubbish a high and mighty man of\nGod.\nIn both cases, I would want to emphasise\nthat my point was not that\nGod could not heal. He does. That is His\nbusiness. I may not have returned home\nHIV-free, but you never can tell what I\nreturned with instead.\nGod heals, but He does not fall into\nour plans. Rather, we fall into His plans.\nI clearly wrote that this was my plan of\nhow God was going to heal me, but His\nplans prevailed against mine. Someone\nonce said, jestingly, that if you want to\nmake God laugh, tell Him your plans.\nThat is a sobering thought.\nI disagree with the person who said it\nwas because I did not have enough faith\nto be healed. Remember Lazarus who\nwas raised from the dead? He was dead\nfor three days. His body had started to\ndecay. Literally, his faith was dead, yet\nhe was raised from death.\nBecause of this case, and on account\nof my faith, or lack thereof, I do not like\nit when people judge me using faith\nparameters.\nGod heals, while doctors treat. Theologians\nare better placed to explain this.\nAlso, God does not do things in \u201cwholesale\u201d\nfashion. He may choose a case or\nscenario without explanation.\nPerhaps that is why Jesus healed using\ndifferent methods. Some were told\ntheir sins were forgiven. Others were\nhealed through their faith. Yet more\nwere given saliva mixed with soil and\nstill got their miracle.\nProof of faith-healing\nI can agree with some readers. My\nHIV sero-conversion was meant to\nremain unhealed. As someone pointed\nout, how else would I have reached\nthese many thousands? God wanted\nme to be this way so I could minister to\nHis people. I think this is a softer landing\nthan others.\nSomeone said I should not have gone\nto check if I had been healed. I totally\ndisagree. Why should I not confirm\nthe outcome? It is like being told you\nhave passed a tough exam with flying\ncolours, yet you fail to go for the result\nslip.\nGod is not \u201cfifty-fifty\u201d, so He does\nnot fear validation. That\u2019s why when\nJesus healed a man, he told him to go\nand show himself to the priest. Then,\npriests were the validating authorities\nto declare one healed for them to be\naccepted back into social events where\nthey had previously been excluded. The\nproof of faith-healing is in proving beyond\nany doubt.\nOne reader advised me to go to their\nchurch because they had miracles.\nI say, \u201cThanks, but no thanks\u201d. As I\nhave said in the past, I have no problem\nwith my HIV status. If I woke up one\nmorning minus my sero-positive status,\nI do not know what I would do differently.\nI have lived with this virus over\nhalf my life. Methinks any separation at\nthis time would not be such a welcome\nidea. This does not mean I do not need\nGod. I do. Not because I am a desperate\ndaughter, but because without Him, I\nam as dead as a dodo.\nHealing is real. But I have never\ncome across a person who at one point\nhad documents indicating they were\nHIV-positive and, after going through\nprayers or whatever, was documented\nas having become HIV-negative.\nThe only case I know of is that of a\nman from Germany who went for bone\nmarrow transplant, only to test HIVnegative\nlater. He was not even going\nfor HIV treatment, but a blood-related\nkind of cancer, which, by chance, led\nto him becoming HIV-negative. That\nwas all well-documented in medical\njournals.\nAllow me to express my doubts about\nsome of our men of the cloth who claim\nto have powers to pray for the reversal\nof the HIV condition. What sticks out\nin all their shenanigans are the M-Pesa\nnumbers, which means without shillings,\nthere will be no healing.\nI repeat: The only proof of faith-healing\nis not a word-of-mouth declaration\nfrom a person with vested interest, but\nan HIV test. And that is because, ideally,\nmedical science should corroborate\nfaith-healing.\nGOD HEALS, DOCTORS TREAT\nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother-of- five who tested HIV-positive 25\nyears ago.
