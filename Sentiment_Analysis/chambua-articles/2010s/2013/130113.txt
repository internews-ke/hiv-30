{"text": "A Maasai woman\u2019s\nsad experience\nIt was around lunch time when she arrived.\nShe was elegantly dressed, though one could\nnot miss the fact that she is Maasai, with her\nstatuesque legs. Since it was a meeting for\nwomen living with HIV, I assumed that she\nwas a facilitator as we started shooting\nthe breeze. I introduced myself as Asunta.\nPeriod. But my friend Mildred introduced\nme \u201cin full\u201d as \u201cAsunta wa Aids\u201d.\n\u201cLeave this one alone. They think Aids\nis my surname,\u201d I told the guest. \u201cWhen\nI mention my name without mentioning\nAids, they think I\u2019ve missed something\nwhich ought to be included.\n\u201cEven Mildred has it, and she actually\ngot it in the early years when it was\nstill new,\u201d I told the guest, adding,\n\u201cfor us we are getting it\nnowadays when it has been\nduplicated and photocopied\nand it has become a generic\nversion!\u201d\nAids as the common denominator\n\u201cMy name is Laisoi and\nit has taken me three days\nto travel for this meeting\nbecause of transport problems. Also,\nI couldn\u2019t leave immediately I got the\ninvitation by word of mouth as I had to\nwait for my husband to grant me permission\nto come to Nairobi. I had\nto give a good reason why I\nwanted to come to Nairobi\n\u2026 and I couldn\u2019t\nsay I was coming\nfor a meeting\nof HIVi\nn f e c t e d\nwomen.\u201d\nLaisoi lied\nthat since she is the\ntreasurer of her village\nwomen\u2019s group, she was coming\nto Nairobi because someone wanted to\nfund the group to start a bead handcraft\nbusiness. She lied to her husband that she\nwas coming to the city with other group\nofficials.\nI was not done with her yet. I had told\nher earlier that we who were in that meeting\nwere all HIV-infected, including the\nfacilitators. So I asked her: \u201cWhat did you\ncome here for\u2026 or, let me be direct. Do you\nhave Aids?\u201d\nThis is a blatant way of inquiring if\nsomeone is HIV-infected. It implies the\nwhole magnitude of the disease and the\nbaggage it carries. Stigma. Discrimination.\nShame. Embarrassment. Social judgement.\nYou name it. The phrase \u201cliving with HIV\u201d\nis a politically correct phrase adopted far\nmuch later. In the early days, we were simply\nreferred to as Aids victims or sufferers,\nwhich denoted helplessness.\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m infected. I\u2019ve been living with\nHIV for almost nine years, but my husband\nand co-wives have refused to be tested,\u201d\nLaisoi said.\n\u201cNow tell us how the virus got through\nto you\u2026 through all those shukas and\nshangas,\u201d that is Mildred, joking even when\nshe is not supposed to. \u201cSurely, has the virus\nno shame that it can penetrate all those\nshukas, bracelets, necklaces all the way to\nMaasai land? I thought your culture and\ndistance safeguards you from contamination\nfrom other uncultured people like\nAsunta or Mildred.\u201d\nSlave to customs\nLaisoi is wife number five of a 78-yearold\nman. She was betrothed long before\nshe was born and her bride price paid.\nShe grew up knowing that she belonged\nto him. \u201cOne time I ran away and joined\nschool, but after Class Eight I went home\nand was forcefully carried to my husband\u2019s.\nMy co-wives were assigned to stand guard\nso that I could not escape. I couldn\u2019t run\naway again. I was already pregnant,\u201d she\nreveals.\n\u201cWhenever a good friend of\nmy husband\u2019s came home\nfor dinner, I had to entertain\nhim overnight in\nour matrimonial bed,\nas demanded by our\ncustoms. I\u2019m not supposed\nto express any\nfeelings or opinion\non this kind of arrangement\nas it\u2019s an\naccepted practice,\u201d\nLaisoi adds. Mildred\ninterjects, to which\nLaisoi replies in the affirmative:\n\u201cI\u2019m sure those who enjoyed\nalways had a reason to pass\nby again and again \u2026 late at\nnight, that is.\u201d\nIt must have\nbeen in one of\nthose occasions\nthat\nshe got\ni n -\nfecte\nd\nwith HIV.\nBefore she\ntested positive for\nHIV, she had other sexually\ntransmitted diseases, which were treated\nwith herbs. She only sought medical help\nif they persisted. Now she has to hide her\nantiretroviral drugs.\nVoiceless women\nI asked her whether she could discuss\nwith her husband her HIV status and she\nsaid she would not. She is the youngest\nwife and only receives instructions and orders,\nwhich sometimes come through the\neldest wife. The closest she comes to her\nhusband is during sexual intercourse. There\nis no talking and sex is only for procreation\npurposes. He is also the one who realises if\nthere is an STD and arranges for herbs or\nmedical treatment. This was an interesting\nexperience \u2014 one I had never heard about\nbefore \u2014 but we never concluded as it was\nalready past lunch time.\nTHE FEAR OF DISCLOSING HIV STATUS\nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a\nmother-of-three who tested HIV-positive\n23 years ago.
