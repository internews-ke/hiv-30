{"text": "Wednesday, December 4,\u00a02013\nPeople with disabilities and HIV/Aids facing challenges\n1 \nBy RACHEL KIBUI\u2028More by this Author \n60-year-old Josephine Leavi has learnt to live with her difficulties taking life as it is.\nShe looks younger than her real age, her stare cannot be associated with blindness, her smile is infectious and her motherly warmth enviable.\nWhen she tested HIV positive eight years ago, Leavi was determined to keep it a secret especially from her three children.\n\u201cI did not want them to have irresponsible sex and risk contacting HIV,\u201d she says.\n\u201cThen they would comfort themselves saying they were just like their mother,\u201d she adds.\nShe however started taking anti-retroviral drugs (ARVs) as medical experts advised in order to keep healthy and live positively.\nA year after she started taking the ARVs, Leavi lost her eyesight for reasons she does not know, but she suspects it to be a side effect of the drugs. \nNO LONGER SECRET\nIt was at that point that she discovered that she could no longer keep her status a secret.\nShe needed someone to pass her the ARVs or accompany her to hospital every time she ran out of drugs.\nHaving to disclose and explain about her HIV status every too often and even to strangers is something Leavi does not like at all.\nYet she finds herself in this situation often.\n\u201cSometime my daughter calls a boda boda to ride me to the Rift Valley Provincial General Hospital (PGH).\nWhen we get to the gate, I have to explain to the rider about my condition and request him to guide me,\u201d she says.\nSometimes boda boda operators get shocked when she explains about where she wants to go and why. \nOthers refuse to guide her and she has to struggle and find her way alone.\nShe cannot get a guide at the PGH. The government has not employed any, yet she goes alone most of the time as she cannot afford transport for herself and a guide.\nAt Bondeni slums in the outskirts of Nakuru town, 37-year-old Monica Wambui sits in her house, struggling with what doctors diagnosed as tuberculosis.\nWambui is deaf and dumb.\nMOCKED\nShe had never thought or heard about HIV, she says, until a few years ago when neighbours and friends started mocking her.\n\u201cThey would say that I had HIV, that I was weak and slim. It felt so bad,\u201d she says, through Margret Wahome, an interpreter.\nDetermined to make a difference in the lives of other deaf and dump people, Wambui underwent training on HIV/Aids and Gender Based Violence by APHIAplus, a local non- governmental organisation. \nShe is now a trainer of trainers who reaches out to the deaf and dump.\u2028\u201cI can\u2019t wait to be well and tell more people living with deafness and dumbness about HIV.\nThey have the right to know but seemingly the government does not care much,\u201d she adds.\nShe says she hates it whenever she visits a hospital and cannot express herself clearly as there are no interpreters.\nNicholas Ng\u2019eno who was trained by Wambui on HIV prevention refers to her as a best friend.\nCONDOM USE\nNg\u2019eno, 33, did not know about HIV prevention until Wambui told him about condom use and the benefits. Like her, he is deaf and dumb.\n\u201cThe society assumes that we are stupid and do not know about sex and drugs, but deaf and dumb people know even more than the \u2018normal\u2019 persons,\u201d says Ng\u2019eno, through an interpreter.\nUnder a project dubbed \u2018Nuru ya Bonde', Aphia Plus has in the recent past trained 40 persons living with disabilities (PLWDs) on HIV.\n\u201cIt is better when the PLWDs get training from one of their own as they will easily associate with the message and the trainers as well,\u201d said Caleb Osano, an officer from APHIAplus.\nNuru ya Bonde is a project that aims at promoting increased access to quality protective services to survivors of sexual assault as part of a comprehensive approach to tackling sexual and gender-based violence.\nIt targets PLWDs and currently operates in Nakuru, Baringo, Laikipia, Narok and Nandi counties.\nThe 2012 National AIDs Control Council (NACC) report does not indicate the HIV/Aids prevalence among PLWDs, an indication that somehow, this group is ignored.\nEfforts to get this information from other organisations such as National Aids and STI Control Program (NASCOP) and LVCT were in futile.\nSeemingly, this group is not accounted for as long as HIV-related issues are concerned.\nPEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES\nHowever, statistics provided by APHIAplus on PLWDs tested in Kisumu and Nairobi between 2011 and 2013 indicated that 51 per cent of PLWDs who were tested turned out HIV positive.\nThe report states that an individual is vulnerable to HIV when his ability to avoid infection is diminished by factors such as lack of knowledge.\nGlobally, 650 million people are estimated to be living with disabilities. \nDeveloping countries account for 80 per cent of this population.\nAccording to Kenya\u2019s 2009 population census, 1.4 million people are living with disabilities in the country.\nAnd according to NASCOP 89 per cent of PWDs are sexually active.\nHowever, only 39 per cent of this population was married or cohabiting with their sexual partners.\nNACC classifies PLWDs as one of the vulnerable groups as fat as contracting HIV/Aids is concerned.\nNACC official Ms Lilian Langat said the organisation had plans to produce information materials such as braille and audio formats in a bid to reach the PLWDs with HIV/Aids education."}
