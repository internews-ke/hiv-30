American Timothy Brown, who suffered from leukemia, received a bone marrow transplant from a rare donor who was resistant to HIV, and has shown no sign of the virus for six years.\n\"The return of detectable levels of HIV in our patients is disappointing, but scientifically significant,\" said Timothy Heinrich, a physician-researcher in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.\nDEEP PERSISTENT RESERVOIR\n\"Through this research we have discovered the HIV reservoir is deeper and more persistent than previously known,\" he said in a statement sent to AFP.\nHeinrich first shared the news with fellow researchers at an international AIDS conference in Miami, Florida on Thursday.\nBoth HIV-positive men received bone marrow transplants as treatment for a kind of blood cancer known as Hodgkin's lymphoma, one in 2008 and the other in 2010.\nAbout eight months after their operations, HIV was no longer detectable.\nThe patients stayed on antiretroviral therapy even after their HIV was undetectable, and eventually decided to cease taking the drugs earlier this year.\nIn July, doctors announced early, encouraging results: one patient appeared to still be HIV-free after being off the drugs for seven weeks and the other for 15 weeks.\nBut signs of HIV soon returned. They were found in the first patient 12 weeks after stopping therapy, and in the second patient after 32 weeks.\n\"Both patients have resumed therapy and are currently doing well,\" Heinrich said, adding that the patients do not wish to be identified in the media.\nHe said it was important to share the results with fellow researchers, because they signal \"that there may be an important long-lived HIV reservoir outside the blood compartment.\"\n\"We have demonstrated HIV can be reduced to undetectable levels by very sensitive research assays, and the virus persists,\" he said.\nVIRAL REBOUND\nPrior to the viral rebound, one of the patients had only about 1,000 cells in his body left with traces of HIV, and the other had just 100, according to the Foundation for AIDS Research, amfAR, which funded the study.\n\"These two cases are telling us some information that we weren't otherwise going to be able to learn,\" said Rowena Johnston, director of research at amfAR.\n\"As much as it is disappointing for the patients themselves, it is absolutely helping us to learn more about what it is going to take to cure HIV.\"\nUnlike Brown, these patients' bone marrow transplants did not come from donors that carried a genetic resistance to HIV by lacking a CCR5 receptor, so they were not afforded protection against the virus by that mutation.\nThe two men received transplants from donors with the CCR5 receptor, which acts as a gateway allowing HIV to penetrate the cells.\nResearchers had hoped that by continuing to treat the men with antiretroviral drugs during the transplant process and afterward, the medicine might have prevented the donor cells from becoming infected while a new immune system was established.\nInstead, it appears the virus may have been lurking undetected in their bodies, infecting the men as if for the first time once repressive drug therapy was stopped.\nTOO EARLY TO CONCLUDE\nStill, Myron Cohen, an expert on HIV/AIDS at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said it was too early to draw conclusions.\n\"I think we need more information,\" he told AFP in an email.\n\"The reason(s) for suppressed growth of HIV in these patients is still being studied, so recurrence -- if it occurred -- needs to be seen as part of a continuum,\" he said.\nadvertisement \nAdvertisement \nMost Popular\n\uf0b7  1 Politics Bensouda seeks private hearing \n\uf0b7  2 News House clears new matatu rules \n\uf0b7  3 World Obama agents sent home from Europe for boozing \n\uf0b7  4 Showbiz Eric Omondi pulls prank on fans with Lupita look-alike \n\uf0b7  5 Counties County reps threaten Kidero \n\uf0b7  6 Politics Wetangula demands arrest of rogue police \n\uf0b7  7 News FULL SPEECH: State of the Nation address \n\uf0b7  8 News JSC seeks to overturn Shollei\u2019s court victory \n\uf0b7  9 News Cane factory worker wins Sh5m mobile banking prize \n\uf0b7  10 News Agony of homeless minors forced to become urchins and fight off sex pests \nAdvertisement \nMost Commented\n\uf0b7  1New law allowing polygamy passed - Politics - nation.co.ke \n\uf0b7  2Homosexuality a serious problem as terrorism, says Duale \n\uf0b7  3Uhuru Kenyatta seeks US help to fight terrorism \n\uf0b7  4Thugs turn luxury homes into tombs - Business - nation.co.ke \n\uf0b7  5US centre defends Raila invitation as 'badge of honour' \n\uf0b7  6Gunmen kill two in attack on Kenyan church: police \n\uf0b7  7Seven days to public transport crisis \n\uf0b7  8Kenyans in the US to be issued with IDs: Embassy \n\uf0b7  9Daily Nation: Living - Breaking News, Kenya, Africa, Politics, Business, Sports, Blogs, Photos, Videos \n\uf0b7  10Mother of son with bullet in head died shielding him \n\nPhoto gallery\nSearch for missing Malaysian plane"}
