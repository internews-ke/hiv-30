{"text": "Clerics slam agency over same-sex report \nBy NATION CORRESPONDENTS\nThe controversial statistics indicating that Nyanza and Coast regions lead with the highest number of gay men has attracted criticism from religious leaders.\nOn Monday, the Council of Imams and Preachers of Kenya\u2019s organising secretary Sheikh Mohammed Khalifa accused the National Aids Control Council (NACC) of \u201cbeing used\u201d by foreign powers to propagate homosexuality in the country.\nInstead of addressing challenges facing HIV/Aids victims, Sheikh Khalifa claimed, the government agency was pushing for same-sex ideology.\n\u201cThe work of this organisation is suspect and should be scrutinised thoroughly otherwise there is the danger of this sexual orientation taking root here,\u201d he said, adding that \u2018gay rights projects\u2019 should not be allowed in the country.\nCatholic Archdiocese of Mombasa vicar-general Wilbard Lagho criticised those pushing for foreign ideologies that lack African Christian values.\nSpeaking on phone, Fr Lagho said the only union acceptable by the Catholic Church was that of a man and a woman.\n\u201cAny other union is against natural law and should not be allowed,\u201d he added.\nBut as human beings, Fr Lagho said, those practising the \u201cunusual sex\u201d were entitled to medical care or counselling services.\nBut NACC director Prof Alloys Orago refuted claims that his organisation was spreading the same-sex ideology, saying, their only interest was to minimise spread of HIV/Aids. He was surprised over Sheikh Khalifa\u2019s claims.\n\u201cWe met the religious leaders in Mombasa a week ago to explain our work to them under the new constitutional dispensation,\u201d he said, adding that they were not \u2018gay rights activists\u2019 as insinuated. \nNational Authority for Campaign against Alcohol and Drug Abuse director Sheikh Juma Ngao said if NACC advocates same sex unions it should be disbanded."}
