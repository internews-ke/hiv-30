{"text": "May 15,\u00a02012\nGlobal Fund makes U-turn and pledges to give grants \nBy NATION REPORTER\nThe Global Fund resumes disbursing grants in September, five months after it announced it would not support new initiatives until 2014 because of lack of funds.\nIn a statement on Friday, the Fund says it will consider new applications for grants covering malaria, HIV and tuberculosis in September, with actual funding expected early next year.\nThe fund\u2019s board said the decision was made possible by a new financial forecast which estimated that approximately $1 billion will be available to fund new grants. \n\u201cJapan renewed its commitment to the Global Fund by deciding to make its largest annual contribution ever in 2012 despite the unprecedented earthquake on March 11, 2011,\u201d says Masaki Noke, a board member.\nThe decision to suspend funding was met with angry protests in Kenya and globally, with civil society calling on donors, especially the Americans, to honour their pledges.\nLocally, the National Aids Control Council has intensified its campaign to become an autonomous body with funding from the government.\nHead of legal services Daniel Konyango said the council is facing many problems in performing its tasks under a line ministry and dwindling donor funds. \n\u201cFunds are on the decline and the organisation\u2019s budgetary allocation under the Ministry of Special Programmes is inadequate,\u201d he said in Mombasa at the weekend. \nThe new development comes barely a month after the Fund released an audit report on its projects in Kenya which demanded that the country refund some 270 million from its malaria, tuberculosis HIV programmes which had either been stolen or not accounted for.\nAccording to the Nairobi based Aidspan, an independent watchdog of the Global Fund, the audit has demanded some $33,986 be refunded by a single unidentified employee in Kenya.\nIn one instance, the government in the audit says, it has recovered the bulk of about Sh4.5 million withdrawn from a Global Fund grant using fake documents, with the staff member in question having been asked to pay back some Sh2.5 million."}
