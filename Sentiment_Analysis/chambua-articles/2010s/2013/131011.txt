What do you have to\nsay about the \u201cTume Chill\u201d campaign?\nKEVIN MOGALLO talks to some young people\nand this is what they had to say...\nCOLLINS KIPKEMBOI, 13yrs.\nIt\u2019s diffi cult to deal with peer\npressure but I am managing my\ntime well, I have loads of homework\nfrom school. This is keeping me\nbusy. When I take a break I watch\nTV or play with my friends.

What do you have to\nsay about the \u201cTume Chill\u201d campaign?\nKEVIN MOGALLO talks to some young people\nand this is what they had to say...\nWAYNE NYAGA, 13yrs.\nI have to advice all the young people to \u2018chill\u2019,\nlet us not give in to peer pressure and engage\nin unlawful activities, fi rst we need to focus on\nour education then everything else will follow.\nThough am not saying it is bad to have friends\nof the opposite sex.
