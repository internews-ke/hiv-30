{"text": "April 23,\u00a02013\nIs there anything like a gay gene?\nBy DR TOROOTI MWIRIGI nation@askadoc.co.ke\nHomosexuality is a topic that is never discussed in public. We know about it but rarely talk about it. So it was shocking when, during my first year in college, our professor went off-topic and got into the taboo subject during an embryology lecture.\nIt was a hot and humid afternoon and the class was packed to the rafters. These conditions, including our full bellies, were making the afternoon lecture unbearable. So, understandably, we were all caught off-guard when the lecturer changed topics. His voice also changed from that of a teacher to that of a concerned father talking to his many children.\nNoticing that he held our attention, he put down his thick bunch of handwritten notes and the chalk on the table and began explaining the development of an embryo in the womb. As the foetus develops, he explained, there is a moment in time when there is a surge of \u201cintercourse\u201d hormones, which determine the sexual characteristics and orientation of the baby.\nHowever, in some rare cases, there is an imbalance of these hormones, and the result is that a male baby will develop \u2018girl-like\u2019 characteristics as they grow up, or a female baby will develop \u2018boy-like\u2019 characteristics. The boy will have the mannerisms of girls and may have a natural attraction towards men, considering his brain has developed as that of a \u201cwoman\u201d. In my professor\u2019s opinion, such boys are considered \u2018born-gays\u2019... but they are in the minority.\nBasically, the lecturer\u2019s conclusion was that homosexualtiy is mostly acquired and learned, and that it all has something to do with the prostrate.\nInitially, his description was confusing. The prostate is a small organ found below the bladder. It plays a role in the production of semen and is mostly known for the negative effect is has on men\u2019s lives. As we tried recalling our newly found anatomy knowledge, our professor picked up the piece of chalk he had put on the table and went on to illustrate the anatomy of the prostate.\nIn his opinion, the majority of men attracted to other men were not necessarily born gay. They do not have the characteristic \u2018gay\u2019 look and it would be difficult to tell such from a \u2018straight\u2019 chap.\n\u201cSo how do they become gay?\u201d he questioned.\n\u201cMen are indoctrinated into a gay lifestyle at an early age when they are impressionable,\u201d he explained. \u201cThis is usually by a friend or older boys. However, the stimulation of the prostrate is what makes them seek out men time and time again. This eventually develops into a lifestyle. It may not mean that these men are not attracted to women. They just get more pleasure elsewhere.\u201d\nWith that he turned his back to the class and began scribbling on the black board.\nYears later, this story came to mind as I watched a documentary detailing a scandal by prominent American politicians. A number of the men confessed being gay after being caught in compromising situations with other men. All of the men in that documentary were upstanding citizens who had wives and children.\n**********"}
