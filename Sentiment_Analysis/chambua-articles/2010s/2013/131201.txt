{"text": "Women and children targeted in new plan to fight against Aids \nDec 1, 2013, Nation\nAccording to a strategy to be rolled out by the Office of the First Lady Margaret Kenyatta,\n\nWomen and children are the main targets of a new plan launched Sunday to help slow down HIV infections.\nAccording to a strategy to be rolled out by the Office of the First Lady Margaret Kenyatta, urgent measures are needed to scale up services to prevent mothers from infecting babies during pregnancy, childbirth or breast feeding.\nAlthough transmission to children has been reduced by nearly half in Kenya, progress is slow, according to the document.\nThe strategy launched during the national event to mark the World Aids Day in Mombasa shows that HIV and Aids will remain a leading cause of death in the coming years despite a drop in national prevalence rates.\nThree in every 10 deaths, it says, would result from the virus in the coming years.\nOverall, the document says, infectious diseases, including HIV and Aids, currently account for more than half of all deaths in Kenya.\nOther deadly diseases include malaria, lower respiratory tract Infections and tuberculosis. \nThe document calls for measures to help reduce infections, mainly among women and children who are currently carrying the greatest burden of Aids.\nCurrently, about 46,000 deaths arise from HIV-related complications.\nBy 2011, Kenya had about 1.6 million people living with the virus. \nAccording to the document, meant to guide the Office of the First Lady in her engagement on crucial health issues in the country, the national HIV prevalence rate has declined significantly over the years, from a high of about 14 per cent in the 1990s to 6.1 among adults aged 15 to 64.\nThe document shows that the number of new HIV infections in the country still remains unacceptably high, at about 91,000 annually. \nThe document promises that the First Lady will engage with other players to seek measures of reducing the number of children suffering from the virus.\nCurrently, an estimated 13,000 children are infected every year, majority of them contracting the HIV virus from their mothers during pregnancy, delivery or breast-feeding. \n\u201cDrivers of sexual transmission have been identified as unprotected paid sex, multiple and concurrent sexual partners, low and inconsistent condom use,\u201d the document says.\nAlthough the document says the country has made progress in putting people living with HIV on treatment, only 33 per cent of children living with HIV are on treatment. \u201cThis contributes to premature deaths among children,\u201d the report says. \nThe document calls for promotion of access to treatment for all children and women in need.\nIt shows that HIV infection is a major contributor to maternal deaths in Kenya. \nThe high fertility rates and low contraceptive use further contributes to the high risks of maternal deaths, the document says.\nJust about half of married women in Kenya use modern contraceptive methods, according to the 2008-9 Kenya Demographic Health Survey.\nAccording to statistics contained in the document, Homa Bay has the highest adult prevalence of HIV of 27.1 per cent. This means its 127,143 adults are living with the virus.\nIt is followed by Siaya which has a prevalence rate of 17.8 per cent, translating to 85,056 adults who are living with the virus.\nIn all, 51 per cent of new adult infections occur in eight of the country\u2019s 47 counties across the country, according to County Profiles prepared by the National Aids Control Council. \nAdditionally, more than 51 per cent of adults living with HIV live in eight counties - Nairobi, Homa Bay, Kisumu, Siaya, Migori, Mombasa, Nakuru, and Kisii. \nThe document, Strategic Framework for Engagement in the HIV and AIDS Response and Promotion of Maternal, Newborn and Child Health in Kenya calls for implementation of policies, strategies and actions to reduce new HIV infections among young people.\nThis will be achieved through mobilisation of men to act as agents of change in order to create an enabling environment for health services uptake and behaviour change."}
