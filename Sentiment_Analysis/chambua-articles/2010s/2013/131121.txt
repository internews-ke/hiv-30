{"text": "November 21,\u00a02013\nDying of Aids too early \n4 \nThe HIV/Aids threat is back with a vengeance, and according to grim statistics provided by UNAids and the government, the virus is spreading fastest among the 15-24 age bracket.\nAccording to researchers, one of the reasons is that na\u00efve youths do not care about infections; they are more interested in being the stigma associated with unwanted pregnancies.\nThen there is an equally appalling reason. Commercial sex workers are increasingly being forced to give in to the demands of their clients for unprotected sex so long as the clients pay them more money. They then swallow anti-retrovirals drugs in the hope the pills will keep HIV at bay.\nIt is, therefore, time parents, the government, schools, religious organisations, NGOs, the media and other well-meaning societal institutions played a more proactive role in creating awareness and educating these youths of the dangers they face if they do not protect themselves.\nElaborate sex education is no longer a choice. \nIf we don\u2019t do something now, the virus will suck us all into a vortex in which Kenyans are robbed of their lives in the flower of their youth."}
