{"text": "RETURN MY STOLEN YEARS\nHere\u2019s my humble petition to God\nDo not blame me. Blame the politicians\nwho filed post-election petitions. I am also\nfiling one against two respondents: HIV and\nAids. The only difference is that the petition is\nto the Supreme Being.\nIn my petition, I want the Righteous Judge\nto parole me. I sincerely believe that I, like others\nin my situation, deserve it. I have already\nserved over 25 years of the life \u2014 and sometimes\ndeath \u2014 sentence that these respondents\nimpose on people living with HIV. By the\nway, PLWHs are enjoined in this petition.\nYour Honour, I know there is a saying that\nanyone who represents themselves has a fool\nfor a lawyer, but I am the one who knows\nwhat the accused has been doing to me for\nalmost three decades now.\nFor starters, Your Honour, the virus rigged\nitself into my body and has attacked my\nstronghold: the white blood cells. Like my\n\u201crunning mates\u201d, that is, fellow PLWHs, we did\nnot sign any coalition deal with the first and\nsecond respondents, HIV and Aids respectively.\nThus, their continued stay in our bodies\nis illegal, oppressive, and unscriptural. And\nthat is because your word says in Jeremiah\nthat, \u201cYou have good plans for me\u201d.\nI will call my first witness, Dr Kinyanjui, who\nis my personal doctor.\nYour Honour, Dr Kinyanjui\u2019s testimony will\nshow that the first respondent is replicating in\nmy body with the sole aim of breaking down\nmy immune system, thus literally giving the\nsecond respondent the licence to kill me.\nYour Honour, I will also call to the witness\nstand my family to give evidence. This consists\nof my partner Richard, and my biological\nand adopted children.\nI will also call expert witnesses. They will\nshow that, one, the first respondent, HIV,\nattaches to cells of the immune system with\nspecial markers called CD4 receptors.\nTwo, HIV infection of CD4 cells causes\ncell death.\nIrrefutable evidence\nThree, reduction in the CD4 cell number\nand the effects on their function reduces\nthe capacity of my body to fight disease,\nand four, individuals with HIV infection are,\ntherefore, susceptible to many infections,\nespecially in the later stages of infection.\nYour Honour, at this point I want to mention\nthat before the virus rigged itself into\nmy body and declared itself ruler over my\nreceptors, my CD4 count was like that of\npeople who are not infected by HIV.\nOver the years, I have had to do numerous\nrecounts to make sure that the first\nrespondent does not have a landslide over\nmy whole body. Besides, if I had allowed\nit to have a landslide, I would be a goner by\nnow.\nYour Honour, my personal doctor, who is\nthe first witness, keeps the forms of the various\nCD4 counts, and other relevant counts,\nwhich I am presenting as evidence.\nThe evidence will show that, over the\npast two-plus decades, I have spent a lot of\nmoney, had sleepless nights, and been denied\nmany opportunities because of my HIV status.\nYour Honour, as evidence, I will present\nthe prescriptions \u2014 from day one to date\n\u2014 of the antiretroviral drugs Tenofovir and\nNevirapine that I have used over the years.\nThey are classified as reverse transcriptase\ninhibitors (RTIs).\nAlso, Your Honour, Dr Kinyanjui will tell this\nhonourable court \u2014 and show the x-rays of\nmy body \u2014 to prove that these drugs have\nleft me with side-effects like lipodystrophy\nand neuropathy.\nI will simply say that because of these and\nother debilitating side effects that I have been\nforced to live with, I am not the woman I used\nto be. What is more, Your Honour, the first\nrespondent has, more times than I can count,\nplotted to kill me through opportunistic infections.\nMy witnesses, Dr Kinyanjui and my family,\nwill testify to the fact that the respondents\nwanted to use the infections to finish me.\nIn HIV-speak, I am what people call a longterm\nsurvivor. And that is because I have\nlived with this virus for so long that at times I\nalmost forget the number of years. Your Honour,\nI know that I am fortunate because many\nof my peers have passed on.\nI would love this court to give me back the\nstolen years; the number of years that the two\nrespondents have stolen. Years when I was\nsupposed to enjoy my youth, but instead had\nto deal with stigma and discrimination.\nTime is not on my side, Your Honour. I need\nsome clemency, if only to care for my children\nwithout having to deal with the stresses that\nthe respondents cause.\nYour Honour, I rest my case.\nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a\nmother-of-three who tested HIV-positive\n25 years ago. She is the executive director\nof the Kenya Network of Women with Aids\n(KENWA).\nEmail: asuntawagura@hotmail.com"}
