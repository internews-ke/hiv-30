{"text": "SOURCE | Baby was infected by her HIV-positive mother\nBaby \u2018cured\u2019 of HIV\nin trial by scientists\nSOURCE | Baby was infected by her HIV-positive mother\nA series of blood\ntests were done by\nthe team, none gave\nHIV-positive results\nResearchers say they\nhave, for the first time,\ncured a baby born with\nHIV \u2014 a development that\ncould help improve treatment\nof babies infected at birth.\nThere is an important technical\nnuance: researchers insist\non calling it a \u201cfunctional cure\u201d\nrather than a complete cure.\nThat is because the virus is\nnot totally eradicated. Still, its\npresence is reduced to such a\nlow level that a body can control\nit without the need for\nstandard drug treatment.\nThe only fully cured AIDS\npatient recognized worldwide\nis the so-called \u201cBerlin patient,\u201d\nAmerican Timothy Brown. He\nis considered cured of HIV and\nleukemia five years after receiving\nbone marrow transplants\nfrom a rare donor naturally\nresistant to HIV. The marrow\ntransplant was aimed at treating\nhis leukemia.\nBut in this new case, the\nbaby girl received nothing\nmore invasive or complex than\ncommonly available antiretroviral\ndrugs. The difference,\nhowever, was the dosage and\nthe timing: starting less than\n30 hours after her birth.\nIt is that kind of aggressive\ntreatment that likely yielded\nthe \u201cfunctional cure,\u201d researchers\nreported Sunday at the\n20th annual Conference on\nRetroviruses and Opportunistic\nInfections (CROI) in\nAtlanta, Georgia.\nWhat researchers call\ndormant HIV-infected cells\noften re-start infections in\nHIV-infected patients within\na few weeks after antiretroviral\ntreatment stops, forcing\nmost people who have tested\nHIV-positive to stay on the\ndrugs for life or risk the illness\nprogressing.\n\u201cPrompt antiviral therapy in\nnewborns that begins within\ndays of exposure may help\ninfants clear the virus and\nachieve long-term remission\nwithout lifelong treatment by\npreventing such viral hideouts\nfrom forming in the first place,\u201d\nsaid lead researcher Deborah\nPersaud, of Johns Hopkins\nChildren\u2019s Center in Baltimore,\nMaryland.\nIt appears to be the first time\nthis was achieved in a baby,\nshe said.\nThe baby was infected by\nher HIV-positive mother, and\nher treatment with therapeutic\ndoses of antiretroviral\ndrugs began even before her\nown positive blood test came\nback.\nThe typical protocol for\nhigh-risk newborns is to give\nthem smaller doses of the\ndrugs until results from an\nHIV blood test is available at\nsix weeks old.\nTests showed the baby\u2019s viral\ncount steadily declined until it\ncould not longer be detected\n29 days after her birth.\nThe child was given follow-up\ntreatment with antiretrovirals\nuntil 18 months, at which point\ndoctors lost contact with her\nfor 10 months. During that\nperiod she was not taking\nantiretrovirals.\nResearchers then were able\nto do a series of blood tests\n\u2014 and none gave an HIV-positive\nresult. (AFP)"}
