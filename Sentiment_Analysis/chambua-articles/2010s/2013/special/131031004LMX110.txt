{"text": "Wednesday, October 31,\u00a02012\nThe greatest title I have is \u2018Mum\u2019 \nBy ASUNTA WAGURA\nLAST WEEK, I told you about awards. Well, I\u2019m just back from the Big Apple, where I was honoured with yet another: The Images and Voices of Hope. \nI was extremely humbled to have been feted. I admit that I was a bit stunned when I learnt about my nomination. For starters, I\u2019ve never considered myself\u00a0a media personality. \nI\u2019ve always termed myself a voice in the wilderness helping women living with HIV to be drivers of their lives, encouraging them to take personal charge of theirs and their children\u2019s destiny.\nI adopted this approach, not because of my professionalism, but because in 1988 I tested HIV-positive. I was young and beautiful, and society was too quick to judge my morals. Before I could say, \u201cWhat?\u201d, I was an outcast in a community that had, until that day, looked at me as a model daughter.\n\u201cI thought I needed to tell the world, through whichever platform, that I didn\u2019t choose to be infected,\u201d I told those attending the award ceremony. \nHowever, being infected with HIV never touched my humanity. I was still a human being; a sister, an aunt, a cousin, a daughter, a girlfriend. And today I\u2019m proud to say that I\u2019m a mother. The greatest and sweetest title I have is \u201cMum\u201d. \n\u201cThat\u2019s what my three kids call me unconditionally every blessed day. Thank you for confirming to me that I made the right decision,\u201d I told the gathering.\nHolding brief for others\nI feel that other sojourners in the Kenya Network of Women with Aids (Kenwa)\u00a0are also deserving of this award. However, I realise that it cannot be divided into 10,000 (the membership of Kenwa).\n\u201cOn their behalf I accept the award. I accept it on behalf of women who live in the slums of Korogocho. Women who never tired of showing care and love to their loved ones when the obvious was to give up on them.\u201d\n\u201cI accept it on behalf of community health workers that took it upon themselves to ensure that hundreds got treatment in time, even if it meant carrying them on their backs. I take it on the behalf of volunteers that refused to give up when donors said the priorities had changed. Those that stood with their sick ones until they breathed their last and ensured they died in dignity.\u201d\nGrace periods\nI told the gathering in New York how all my hopes and dreams were crashed with one sentence: \u201cAsunta, I\u2019m sorry you have Aids.\u201d I was then in nursing school and the messenger who delivered this death sentence was the principal. \nWhen she realised her statement had wrecked me, she gave me the \u201cgood\u201d news: \u201cI don\u2019t mean you\u2019ll die immediately; you can live even for six months.\u201d \nThat\u2019s the last I saw of the inside of the school. I was sent home to await the end of my six months\u2019 grace period.\n\u201cHow I wish this principal was here today to witness that it was not all. Rather, my HIV seropositive status was the magic key God used to open doors of hope to the tens of thousands that I\u2019ve reached. That I\u2019ve told it\u2019s not over. That they, too, can pull out from hopelessness, and move on.\u201d \nLooking back, I now know it was all God\u2019s grace. Over the years, I\u2019ve buried many peers, yet God has blessed me with longevity.\nPartners in the struggle\nIn the \u201cdark old days\u201d, HIV-related stories were blacked out in almost all media houses. So it was sweet that I was receiving this award because I had been sharing my experiences through every available media. \nHowever, there were others, like Tom Arocho, who made it their business to air our stories. I\u2019m indebted to such folks. \n\u201cI want to express my gratitude to those who supported and funded me in all my undertakings in Kenwa. Those who didn\u2019t tire of teaching me to use the computer when I told them I could not locate the letter \u2018K\u2019 on the keyboard. Today I can type without looking at the keyboard.\u201d \nAll these folks \u2014 faceless or not \u2014 have been partners in this struggle. \nWhat made the award such a sweet victory was that, until recently, Uncle Sam didn\u2019t allow anyone who was HIV-positive to enter the US. Look how far we\u2019ve come, baby."}
