{"text": "SADC urged\nto order\ncompulsory\nAids testing\nLILONGWE, Monday\nZimbabwe President Robert\nMugabe has proposed introduction\nof compulsory HIV testing\nin the SADC region as one way of\nfighting the HIV/Aids pandemic.\nMr Mugabe suggested this in the\nMalawi capital, Lilongwe, on Sunday\nduring a breakfast meeting of\nHeads of State and Government\non Aids Watch Africa (AWA) on\nthe side-lines of the 33rd SADC\nSummit.\nHe said if the region was to\nmake headway in the fight against\nHIV and Aids, the matter ought to\nbe treated in the same way other\nmedical conditions, such as polio,\nare treated.\n\u201cThe problem is that when it\ncomes to HIV/Aids testing, issues\nof freedom and rights come into\nplay and yet, we force people to\ngo for testing and vaccinations\nfor diseases such as polio,\u201d said\nMugabe.\nHe said much as individual\nfreedom should be respected,\nuniversal and compulsory testing\nof HIV could be the most\nviable way.\nHe further tipped member\nstates on how successfully his\ncountry was fairing in mitigating\nthe impact of HIV and Aids\nby introducing levies to support\nfamilies affected by the pandemic.\nBut Heads of States at the meeting\ndiffered with Mugabe on the\nidea of enforcement of compulsory\nHIV testing saying it was\nnot feasible.\nAmong those who opposed\nMugabe\u2019s idea was Botswana President\nIan Khama who proposed\nthe need for early interventions.\n\u201cSince the logistics of making\nuniversal and compulsory testing\nwould be high, funds meant\nfor development would be diverted\ntowards funding the initiative,\u201d\nsaid Mr Khama. Democratic\nRepublic of Congo President\nJoseph Kabila said there was\nneed for member states to consider\nproduction of ARVs within\nthe region. (Xinhua)"}
