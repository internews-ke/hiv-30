{"text": "The 3rd National HIV Prevention Summit: 17th-18th Sept. 2013\nNATIONAL AIDS CONTROL COUNCIL\nTheme: \u201cHIV Prevention: Every one\u2019s Business\u201d.\nOFFICE OF THE PRIME MINISTER\nMINISTRY OF STATE FOR PUBLIC SERVICE MINISTRY OF HEALTH\nHIV represents one of the greatest\npublic health challenges confronting\nKenya today. Despite the\nachievements made in the fight\nagainst the scourge in the last decade HIV\nremains a challenge to the Country\u2019s socioeconomic\ndevelopment. As at 2012 (KAIS\nII, 2012), 5.6% of adults in Kenya aged 15\nto 64 years or about 1.2 million people\nwere living with HIV. This is a decrease\ncompared to 2007 (KAIS I, 2007), when the\nprevalence was 7.2% or about 1.4 million\npeople.\nIt has been a long three decades since the\nfirst HIV Case was diagnosed in Kenya and\na case definition done to give scientists,\npolicy makers and health service providers\na road map to deal with the scourge.\nToday Kenya holds the fourth largest epidemic\nin the World with a total of 1.2 million\npeople living with the Virus (KAIS II,\n2012) as the search for the elusive cure\nfor AIDS continues.\nA lot has however been achieved in the\nefforts aimed at combating the scourge.\nThe Prevalence rates have come down\nfrom a high of 14% in the 1990\u2019s at the\npeak of the epidemic to the current rate\nof 5.6%.(KAIS II, 2012). The number of\ndeaths from HIV related infections have\ndrastically come down as more and more\npeople are being put on life prolonging\ndrugs (ART).\nWe are now at a tipping point in the fight\nagainst HIV and AIDS. Science has given\nScourge still a challenge yet to be tamed\nMessage from the Cabinet Secretary for Health has aligned itself to a number of\nGlobal Declarations regarding HIV\nand AIDS and even made national\ndeclarations resolving to continue\na sustained war against HIV and\nAIDS. If left unchecked HIV and\nAIDS is capable of watering down\nall the gains we have made in the\nsocio-economic development of\nthe country. Slightly more than ten\nyears ago World leaders made a\ndeclaration at the United Nations\nSecurity council to tackle HIV and\nAIDS Globally to which Kenya was\na party. Almost at the same time\nKenyan Political leadership lead by\nthe former President His Excellency\nHon. Mwai Kibaki launched a campaign\nto wipe out AIDS in Kenya under\nthe slogan \u201cPamoja tuangamize\nUkimwi\u201d.\nToday as we engage in defining\nthe next steps to take forward the\nwar against HIV and AIDS in Kenya\nthrough an agreed formula of a\nRoad Map under the theme \u201cHIV\nPrevention: Every one\u2019s Business\u201d\nwe look forward to a paradigm\nshift that is envisaged to be a game\nchanger in the HIV and AIDS Programming\nin the Region. This roadmap\nrecognizes the complexity of\nHIV and AIDS regarding prevalence\nand incidence and draws on this to\nidentify priority populations and interventions.\nThis overlaps with administrative\nboundaries of Kenya\u2019s\n47 Counties. Approximately 9 high\nHIV burden counties account for\n54% of the HIV Prevalence in the\ncountry\nWhile several enabling factors are\nnecessary, the epidemic\u2019s future in\nKenya will be determined, in large\nmeasure, by the country\u2019s success\nin making revolution in behavioral,\nstructural and biomedical interventions,\nan all inclusive combination\nprevention, care and treatment and\nmitigation.\nRecently programmes targeting high impact\nareas of intervention of Most-At-Risk\nPopulations and pregnant mothers in addition\nto Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision\nhave been emphasized with notable\npositive results contributing directly to the\nattainment of the Millennium development\ngoal number six (MDG No. 6 Combating HIV\nand AIDS, Malaria and other diseases). This\nmomentum needs to be sustained in order\nfor the country not to lose the gains made\nso far.\nBeing part of the Global Community Kenya\nMr. James Macharia\nProf. Fred K. Segor\nMessage from the Principal\nSecretary, Ministry of Health\nWhile several enabling factors are necessary, the epidemic\u2019s future in\nKenya will be determined, in large measure, by the country\u2019s success in\nmaking revolution in behavioral, structural and biomedical interventions\nPrevalence rates down to 5.6 percent\n\u201c\nus the knowledge and tools that we can\nuse to interrupt HIV transmission from the\nmother to the baby during pregnancy, delivery\nand breastfeeding. The government\nhas continued to scale up evidence based\nHIV preventive measures to attain its goal\nof an HIV free society by targeting high impact\ninterventions.\nPreventing Mother-To-Child Transmission\nof HIV (PMTCT), has been one of the great\nbut little known HIV prevention success\nstories. Because of these tools, today, the\nworld is talking about a reality of a new\ngeneration free of HIV. Therefore, PMTCT\nis considered a preventive priority and over\n90% of all HIV Positive pregnant women\nvisiting ANC in 2012 received ARVs for prevention\nof mother to child transmission of\nthe HIV virus to their babies. PMTCT services\nhave made great impact on the mother\nto child transmission with the rates dropping\nfrom 28% in 2005 to 8.5% in 2012\n.\nIn 2001, Voluntary Counseling and Testing\n(VCT) was introduced in Kenya and the\nnumber of testing sites have since continued\nto increase from 1600 sites then to\n5700 sites in 2012. As a result of this, the\nnumber of people tested for HIV every year\nhas risen to over 6.7 million. The Government\nhas revised the National testing algorithm\nwhich is expected to boost the capacity\nand efficacy of the testing process and\nmore reliable results once it is rolled-out.\nThese achievements would not have been\npossible without the collaboration and support\nfrom the Partners and the resolve by\nour own local experts who have dedicated\ntheir time and efforts to realize these results.\nThese efforts have been put in the\nareas of the search for an HIV vaccine\nwhere great sons and daughters of this\ncountry have shown exemplary progress.\nRelevant Policies and protocols that guide\nHIV and AIDS interventions have continuously\nbeen developed and reviewed to\nensure that they are in tandem with the\nInternationally agreed guidelines.\nThe National HIV Prevention Summit\nwould therefore not have come at a better\ntime to rejuvenate and build on the\nachievements made in the HIV and AIDS\ninterventions so far. The Government will\ncontinue to ensure progressive and consistent\nmove towards the realization of\nuniversal access to HIV and AIDS services\nas we work towards creating a new generation\nfree of HIV.\nDAILY NATION\nMonday September 16, 2013"}
