{"text": "Wednesday, May 8,\u00a02013\nLobby group hits out at bishops over advert stance \nBy NATION REPORTER\nA lobby group has accused the Catholic Church in Kenya of putting lives at risk by rejecting the use of condoms.\nCatholics for Change president Jon O\u2019Brien said some Catholics had accepted that condoms can be used, and must be used in some cases, but Kenyan bishops \u201creject all this wisdom\u201d.\n\u201cEven Pope Benedict said that \u2018where the intention is to reduce the risk of infection\u2019 condoms can be \u2018a first step in a movement toward a different way, a more human way, of living sexuality,\u201d he said in a statement Wednesday.\nThis came a day after the Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops distanced itself from advertisements by the group promoting the use of condoms and reaffirmed its stand against them.\nChairman John Cardinal Njue on Tuesday said those behind the Catholics for Choice advertisements were not Catholics and advised the faithful to disregard the messages.\nThe Cardinal (above) reiterated that the stand of the universal Catholic Church on condom use had not changed and that they were \u201cpro-life and not pro-choice\u201d.\nHowever, Mr O\u2019Brien maintained that they belonged to the church and urged the Kenyan faithful to learn from Catholics elsewhere.\n\u201cCatholics around the world embrace the belief that using a condom to protect ourselves and our loved ones is profoundly pro-life \u2014 because it saves lives when we prevent HIV and Aids. Majority of Catholics polled in Ghana, Ireland, Mexico, the Philippines and the US agree,\u201d the statement read.\nAccording to Mr O\u2019Brien, these Catholics are encouraged to use condoms where they\u2019re needed for HIV prevention.\n\u201cWe, and many millions of Kenyans, are Catholic by our baptism. We are Catholic by our fidelity to the foundational teachings of our faith, among which is the indisputable primacy of the conscience in moral decision-making,\u201d he said.\nFurther, Mr O\u2019Brien called on the members of the church to decide for themselves on the matter, saying, the \u201cchurch is not limited to the bishops.\u201d\n\u201cThe church is the people of God, we who are baptised believers and clergy together. We have a right, and indeed, a duty to speak up about matters that affect our lives. In the Condoms4Life campaign, we have, our message is: Good Catholics use condoms,\u201d Mr O\u2019Brien said."}
