{"text": "This 53-year-old Reverend is living positively\n\nBY YVONNE KAWIRA\nymurori@ke.nationmedia.com\nReverend Gideon Boguma\nByamughisha had everything going for him\n\u2014 he was in his final year at a theological\ncollege, had a beautiful and loving wife, and\na daughter who gave him much happiness.\nAnd then one day, just like that, his\nseemingly perfect life changed.\nIt was in 1991 when his wife, Kellen,\ntold him that she was feeling unwell. She\ncomplained of chest and back pain as well\nas headache. Gideon says that he took\nher to hospital for a check-up, certain\nthat it was nothing serious since she was\ngenerally healthy and rarely fell ill. It turned\nout that she had pneumonia, but the doctor\nassured them that it was nothing to be\nalarmed about. He gave her medication\nand asked her to return for a review the\nfollowing week. Unfortunately, Kellen died\non the day she was to return to hospital, on\nApril 30, 1991.\nGideon was shattered. The last thing he\nhad expected was his wife\u2019s death. They\nhad been married for four years only and\nthey were young \u2014 he was 32 while she\nwas 25 \u2014 and were just beginning to map\nout their future. There was also their threeyear-\nold daughter, Patience, who had been\nrobbed of a mother at too tender an age.\n\u201cWhen Kellen died, I had just been\nawarded a scholarship to pursue a PhD\nin theology at a university in the United\nKingdom. We were, in fact, preparing for\nthe move,\u201d says Gideon, a Ugandan.\nWhen he thought things could not get\nworse, the bombshell that would change\nhis life for good dropped, six months after\nhis wife\u2019s death. He had by then graduated\nwith a degree in theology and was teaching,\n(he also has a degree in education) at his\nalma mater\n\u201cI was gradually trying to come to terms\nwith Kellen\u2019s death when a sister-in-law told\nme that she had died of a HIV/Aids-related\nillness. I have never been so shocked in my\nlife, and though I wanted to believe that she\nwas lying, I knew that she wouldn\u2019t say that\nif it wasn\u2019t the truth.\u201d\nHe knew that he had to go for testing,\nbut afraid of what he would learn, he put it\noff for as long as possible.\nHIV-positive\n\u201cI decided to do some soul-searching\nfirst. I needed to know what to do in case I\nturned out to be HIV-positive \u2014 I decided\nto prepare for the worst and also decided\nthat I wouldn\u2019t waste time trying to figure\nout how I contracted the virus. What was\ndone was done, and it was time to move\nahead.\u201d\nIn January 1992, he finally gathered\ncourage and went for testing. The test\nconfirmed what he had feared most: he\nwas HIV-positive.\nGideon says that even though he knew\na lot about HIV and Aids, and was aware\nof the stigma that those affected by it were\nsubjected to, he only got to know how deep\nit was after his diagnosis.\n\u201cI experienced it right in that testing\nand counselling room,\u201d he says, and\nadding, \u201cAfter he gave me the results, the\ncounsellor gave me a very patronising look,\nstaring pointedly at my collar, then said,\n\u2018Man of God, what are you going to do?\u2019\u201d\nGideon says that this experience\nprepared him for what to expect when he\nwalked out. He wondered how his students\nand the school administration would react\nif he disclosed his status.\n\u201cBefore going for testing, I\u2019d decided\nto declare my status if I tested positive,\nbut at that point, I started to have second\nthoughts.\u201d\nAfter a furious tug of war within himself,\nhe finally decided to go public.\n\u201cMy students looked up to me and I\nknew that I\u2019d be failing them and myself\nif I kept the news to myself,\u201d he explains.\nStill, he says it was the most difficult thing\nhe has ever done, especially, as he points\nout, as it was uncommon for religious\nleaders to openly declare their positive HIV\nstatus. There was also the fact that at that\ntime, the condition was associated with\npromiscuity.\nThe first person he disclosed his HIV\nstatus to was his employer.\n\u201cThe principal was very supportive \u2014 his\npositive reaction made it easier for me to\nconfide in fellow lecturers and my students\nas well. Contrary to his misgivings, they all\ntook the news well.\nHowever, his benefactor, the one who\nwas to fund his studies, withdrew his\nsupport.\n\u201cI had informed them of my wife\u2019s death\nas well as my HIV status, confident that it\nwouldn\u2019t matter,\u201d he says.\nHowever, all he got for his honesty were\n\u201cnice\u201d letters stating how sympathetic they\nwere about his condition and his wife\u2019s\ndeath, explaining that they wanted to give\nhim time to deal with the misfortune in his\nlife and to get back on his feet.\nGideon says that this letter was followed\nby another claiming that his sponsor was\nno longer in a position to\nsupport him.\n\u201cOf course I was\ndisappointed, but I was\nthrough the worst, and\nwasn\u2019t about to allow the\nsetback to pull me down,\u201d\nhe says.\nIn the midst of this,\nhowever, the news that\nhis daughter was HIVnegative\nbuoyed his spirit\nand gave him the fortitude\nto soldier on, at least for her\nsake.\nFour years after his wife\u2019s death, Gideon\nremarried. His second wife, Pamela, had\nlost her first husband to a HIV-related\nillness.\n\u201cI\u2019d known Pamela for a long time. Her\nlate husband had been my cousin and\nboth had been the best couple during my\nwedding. The fact that we\u2019d gone through\nmore or less the same experiences made it\nmuch easier for us to get close,\u201d he says.\nWhen they announced that they wanted\nto get married, not everyone toasted to\ntheir happiness.\n\u201cMy mother was supportive of our\ndecision, but some relatives thought that\nwe were making a foolish decision \u2014 some\nopposed the decision because they feared\nI\u2019d die and leave them the burden of taking\ncare of Pamela.\u201d\nDeath sentence\nBut the couple was determined to\ncontinue living. After all, as Gideon\nputs it, \u201cthe disease is no longer a death\nsentence\u201d.\nHowever, even though both wanted\nchildren, they decided not to have them\nimmediately, since they wanted to explore\nall avenues of ensuring that any child they\nhad would be HIV-negative.\nSeven years later, when they were sure\nthat it could be done, they started trying for\na child. Today, Gideon and Pamela are the\nproud parents of three daughters, Patience,\n23, from Gideon\u2019s first marriage, Love 11,\nand Hope, who turns nine this year.\n\u201cToday, thanks to technology, HIVpositive\npeople can live like other people\nwho are HIV-negative \u2014 I\u2019m proof of that,\u201d\nhe says and adds, \u201cWe\u2019re happy and live like\nany other normal family \u2014 we have our ups\nand downs, but we support each other. We\naccept each other as we are and are very\nhappy,\u201d he says.\nGideon and his wife have only disclosed\ntheir status to their first daughter,\nPatience.\n\u201cThe younger ones do not know yet, but\nit is not a secret. They see us taking our\nmedication, and one day our second born,\nLove, asked why I was taking medication; I\ntold her that I was HIV-positive.\u201d\nShe was nine years then and the\nconversation did not go farther, maybe\nbecause she was too young to understand\nwhat it meant. Therefore, Gideon let the\nmatter rest.\nHe adds that when Patience was much\nyounger, she came home from school one\nday and told him that her friends had told\nher that he would die of HIV and wanted\nhim to clarify whether this was the truth.\n\u201cI decided to go to her school and give\na talk about HIV and Aids \u2014 ignorance is\none of the aspects that undermine the fight\nagainst HIV.\u201d\nIt is now more than 20 years since\nGideon was diagnosed with HIV.\n\u201cI have never regretted going public\nabout my status; I have found it easier to go\nabout my life since I have nothing to hide,\u201d\nhe says.\nThere is a lot that African governments\ncan do to help eliminate HIV and Aids, he\nreckons.\n\u201cGovernments should invest in\nknowledge for the people who are already\nHIV-positive. This way, they\u2019ll know how\nto ensure that they don\u2019t infect others,\nknowingly or unknowingly.\u201d\nHe describes three types of groups he\nhas so far encountered since he revealed\nhis HIV status.\nThe first group supported and\nencouraged him to go ahead and tell people\nwhat the disease is all about and demystify\nthe myths attached to it.\nThis group got together and formed a\nfoundation called Friends of Canon Gideon\nByamughisha. They train people on how to\nlive, and thrive, with the virus.\nThe second group felt that there was\nno need to wash his dirty linen in public.\nThey expected him to remain quiet about\nhis status and assume a \u201cnormal\u201d life\nlike everyone else. \u201cAs a man of God you\nshould protect the church,\u201d they would\ntell him.\nIndifferent\nThe last group appeared to be indifferent\nto his story since his condition did not\naffect their lives in any way.\n\u201cThey listened to me tell my story and\nthen went back to their lives. To them, HIV\nand Aids feature nowhere in their lives.\u201d\nHe says that what encourages him to\ntalk about the virus to as many people\nas he can is the first group, which grows\nbigger each day. His work has not gone\nunnoticed.\nIn 2009, Gideon was feted with the 26th\nannual Niwano Peace Prize for his work in\nupholding the dignity and rights of people\nliving with HIV.\n\u201cThe award humbled me and encouraged\nme to keep on doing what I am doing, to\nsoldier on, to continue living,\u201d he says.\nGideon is thankful that so far, three\nthings have been achieved since the\ndiscovery of HIV.\n\u201cFirst, we know how the disease moves\nfrom one person to the other. We also know\nhow to take care of people infected with the\ndisease and ensure that they live long. The\nthird, and greatest, breakthrough is that\nwe can now break the line of transmission\nfrom mother to child. This is almost all the\nammunition we need to fight this disease.\u201d\nHe believes that if we use this knowledge\nwell, then the number of people who get\ninfected with the virus worldwide will\ndrastically go down.\nGideon is in Kenya for a year and\nis a scholar in residence at St Paul\u2019s\nUniversity, Limuru, where he also teaches\ngender, theology, and HIV, Christian ethics\nand HIV, among other courses."}
