{"text": "WORRYING TREND | Alarm over increasing cases of people asking for pills meant to shield health professionals from infection\nYouths abusing\ndrugs meant for\nHIV emergencies\nCONTINUED FROM PAGE 1\n\nHealth workers and victims of sexual\ncrimes. It is usually administered to\nthose suspected to have come into\ncontact with HIV-infected material.\nThe treatment must start within\n72 hours of exposure and consists\nof a daily dosage of six tablets taken\nfor 28 days.\nDoctors are worried that those\nabusing the PEP pills do not take\nthe full dosage, thus not only risking\ninfection but also incubating a\nvirus which is resistant to medication.\nThe drugs are only available in\npublic hospitals and are provided at\nno cost. It is illegal for chemists to\nstock them.\nWhen PEP was first introduced as\nan emergency drug to prevent HIV\ninfection in the early 1990s, it was\npraised as a scientific breakthrough.\nAt the time, it was meant for health\nprofessionals who were at great risk\nof being infected with the virus in the\nline of duty. With time, it was made\navailable to people exposed to the\nvirus under circumstances, such as\nrape or sexual assault.\nIn the recent past, however, there\nhas been a sharp rise in the number\nof people seeking the drugs, after engaging\nin unprotected sex especially\nduring holidays and weekends.\nMany of those asking doctors to\ngive them the pills use them the same\nway others use emergency contraceptives\n\u2014 as an afterthought.\nMany of them claim to have had\n\u201caccidents\u201d which exposed them to\nHIV. The accidents, according to\nNyeri County Aids and Sexually-transmitted\nDiseases coordinator Jeniffer\nKiruri, range from sexual assault or a\nneedle prick to a torn condom.\nShe said that between July and September,\nthe Nyeri Provincial General\nHospital gave the pills to more than\n100 patients, most of them young\npeople of 16 years and above.\nThis group is one of the most at\nthe risk of HIV infection.\nAsk doctors\nDr Enoch Ondari, the Kisii Level\nFive medical superintendent, said\nthe health centre received requests\nfor PEP occasionally especially during\nweekends.\n\u201cPeople do come to our facility to\nseek PEP services with the excuse\nof a burst condom. Normally, this\nhappens during the weekends or on\nMonday morning,\u201d he said.\nHospital records indicate that more\nmen than women ask doctors for the\ntablets.\nDr Martin Sirengo, the head of\nNational Aids and STI Control Programme\n(Nascop), said there had\nbeen an alarming rise in the number\nof people abusing the drugs especially\nafter weekends.\n\u201cWe cannot deny them the drug\nbecause it is available,\u201d he said.\nBut to qualify for a prescription,\none must undergo thorough testing\nand provide contact details to the\ndoctor giving the tablets.\nThis procedure is meant to make\nit difficult for middlemen to get the\ndrugs for free from public hospitals\nand resell them.\nDr Juliana Atieno, the chief administrator\nat Jaramogi Oginga Odinga\nTeaching and Referral Hospital in\nKisumu, said the hospital was one\nof those that had developed strict\nguidelines on who should get PEP.\n\u201cMany people were coming for the\ndrug,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had to lay down a\nprotocol. First, a person has to come\nwith the partner for testing,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe partner must be traced for one\nto get help.\u201d\nDr Atieno warned that the drugs\nshould not be a licence for irresponsible\nsexual behaviour.\n\u201cThe drug\u2019s effectiveness might\nbackfire if you skip a dose. Why do\nyou have to undergo that? You have\na good option of using a condom,\u201d\nshe said.\nMs Monica Ndegwa, the Kieni\nEast District Public Health officer,\nsaid the uptake of the drug could be\nbecause young people wanted to take\nshort-cuts.\n\u201cJust like in pregnancy pills, young\npeople want to take short-cuts. My\nadvice is, before you engage in\nanything, know the status of your\npartner,\u201d she said.\nMrs Christine Otieno, a programme\nofficer in HIV prevention at Kenyatta\nNational Hospital, said the demand\nfor the drug shoots up especially during\nholidays and after weekends.\n\u201cWe counsel the users first. They\nmust finish the dose, otherwise they\nmay be resistant to ARVs in the event\nthey acquire the virus,\u201d she said.\nAccording to her, some of those\nseeking the drug are genuine cases\nof rape.\n\u201cOthers come with that excuse yet\nthey did it willingly, but we cannot\ndeny them the service,\u201d she said.\nAdditional reporting by Muthini\nStephen\nPEP is a combination of two\ndrugs: Aluvia and Combivin and\nis only available at no cost in\npublic hospitals.\nA person for whom PEP has\nbeen prescribed is required\nto swallow six tablets in a day\nfor 28 days. One takes three\ntablets \u2014 two Aluvia and one\nCombivin \u2014 twice a day.\nPEP is not a simple morningafter\npill: it is a month-long\ncourse of treatment.\nPEP treatment must begin\nwithin 72 hours of exposure to\nHIV. The sooner the treatment\nstarts the better.\nThe drug is mostly used within\nthe health sector as part of a\ncomprehensive precautions\npackage that reduces staff exposure\nto infectious hazards at\nwork.\nAn exposed health care worker\nshould proceed with treatment\nonly after informed consent.\nAmong the common side effects\nof PEP are nausea and diarrhoea.\nBACKGROUND\nTablets must be\ntaken for 28 days"}
