{"text": "A post-election\npetition to God\n\nHEAVENLY FATHER, IT IS TWO DAYS after our General Election. For starters, I\nthank you for placing me in this beautiful\nand blessed country. I cannot forget strifetorn places like Somalia and Afghanistan\nwhere there is untold suffering. But they\ntoo are in your agenda. You haven\u2019t forgotten\nthem.\nLord, I am grateful that you have seen\nme through the last five years since our last\npolls. Speaking of elections, Father, I make\na special request: Please make all losers\naccept the results and give winners the humility\nto work with the losers. This country\nis blessed, although sometimes we refuse\nto put the wisdom you have given us into\npractice. We even fail to see simple things\nlike the fact that in all competitions, there\nmust be a winner and a loser.\nHIV status\nFather, you have proved to me and\nthrough me that people can be served\nand reached, not only by those elected to\noffice, but even when they use their HIV\nstatus for the good of others. Election\nfever and shortsightedness make us fail to\nacknowledge that leaders come from you.\nWe forget it is not all about powerful parties,\nwealth, experience, families or history.\nIt is about you and your choice. You chose\nDavid, Jesse\u2019s last born child. I am sure he\nwasn\u2019t a sight to behold for some eyes;\nsmelling of sheep poop and everything!\nYet, you anointed and made him the greatest\nKing Israel ever had.\nI pray that the day before yesterday you\nremoved the veils in our eyes and helped us\nelect leaders you had anointed, even if they\nmay not be sights to behold. Dear God,\nrecently the American people chose their\nleader. One of their practices I would love\nour politicians to buy is loyalty, not partyhoping.\nHere, we do it, even if it is obvious\nthat one will never make it. Some, including\none of my uncles, went to the grave\na pauper after vying so many times and\nrefusing to admit he had been rejected as\na leader. I think it is because there are tons\nof priviledges when someone is in an elective\nposition. God, sometimes I doubt if it is\nthe interest of the people that drives these\nintense campaigns.\nDuring rallies, I could read real craving for\nraw power. I couldn\u2019t stop wondering what\nwould happen if their bids flopped. In the\npast, we have seen healthy people die not\nlong after elections because they couldn\u2019t\nlive with the truth that they lost. God, help\nlosers know that they still have plenty of\nopportunities to serve your people.\nPrayers for peace\nChrist, I pray for peace after the outcome.\nPeace like the one you said you gave\nthe apostles. Peace that surpasses all human\nunderstanding. In the past, we have\ndemonised ethnic communities yet it is you\nwho created them. And you had a purpose.\nIt is us and our selfish interests who flipped\nthe script. Lord, help us remove this veil to\nmake us see the strength in each community\nand the diversity and wealth they come\nwith to complement one another.\nI pray that what will sprout out after the\npolls will be forums to thank you and not\nmore IDP camps. You have given me three\ndear sons. I take every life to be precious,\ndespite differences in opinion. May the one\nelected as our national leader know that he\nwill be serving you and your people. Sometimes\nsuch a leader causes unnecessary\ngridlocks and road users are stopped by\nthe roadside to wait for him to pass. This is\nvery inconsiderate.\nFor most of us, time is of essence. It,\ntherefore, makes no sense for thousands\nof citizens to idle by the road for\nsomeone to pass hours later at neckbreak\nspeed. What pains me,\nLord, is that he is the same\nperson millions of us stood\nin queues for hours on end\nto elect.\nLord, I hope the leader\nwill take your counsel and\ndeliver your people from\nmany burdens; economic,\nsocial and emotional. We\npray whoever is elected will\nbe someone who knows\nand acknowledges you in all\nfacets of life.\nAmen.\nPRAYER FOR WINNERS AND LOSERS OF ELECTION\nThis is the diary of Asunta\nWagura, a mother-of-three\nwho tested HIV-positive 23\nyears ago.
