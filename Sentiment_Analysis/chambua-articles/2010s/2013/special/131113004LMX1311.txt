{"text": "Don\u2019t they make a formidable team?\nSally Gwengi was nine when she learnt her father was HIV\npositive. She is now 18, and together, they are helping to\ndemystify the virus in their home area in Migori, Nyanza\nProvince\nBY RAMENYA GIBENDI\n@ramenyag\nrgibendi@ke.nationmedia.com\n\nWhen Sally Gwengi\u2019s father told\nher and her two sisters that he was HIV positive,\nshe knew with certainty that he\nwould die and leave them orphaned.\nHer mother had died a couple of\nyears earlier and there were rumours\nthat \u201cthe virus\u201d had killed her. The rumours\nalso predicted that it was just\na matter of time before their father\ntoo died.\nSally was only nine years old then,\nher older sisters 11 and 13. Though\nshe did not really understand what\nHIV was, all she needed to know was\nthat it was a \u201cbad disease\u201d which\nhad robbed her of her mother and\nwould take away her father too.\n\u201cOur neighbourhood friends as\nwell as our schoolmates avoided us\nand refused to play with us or even\ncome near us in case we infected\nthem,\u201d says Sally.\nShe had prayed and hoped that the\nrumourmongers were wrong, but\nafter her father\u2019s disclosure, whatever\nhope she had of living a\nnormal life was extinguished\nPeter\u2019s story\nSally\u2019s father, Peter Gwengi, 49, discovered\nthat he was HIV-positive in\n2001. Around that time, his wife\u2019s health\nsuddenly deteriorated. It was then that\nhe learnt that she was HIV-positive and\nhad been on antiretroviral therapy for six\nyears, since 1995, a fact that she had kept\nfrom him, perharps due to fear of rejection\nand ridicule.\nPeter learnt about his wife\u2019s status is a\ncruel manner.\n\u201cI was in the process of transferring\nher from a local hospital to another health\nfacility where I thought she would get better\ncare and treatment when a nurse curtly\nasked me why I was bothering, yet Aids\nwould kill her anyway,\u201d he says.\nThis statement hit him like a thunderbolt,\nand that very day, he went to see his\nfamily doctor at the Aga Khan University\nHospital in Kisumu to find out if indeed\nhis wife was HIV-positive.\nWhat he learnt shocked him to the core\n\u2014 his wife had been diagnosed with the\nvirus six years earlier and had been on\nantiretroviral therapy throughout this\ntime.\n\u201cI could not believe that I was the only\none who had been in the dark all along.\u201d\nThe doctor, who had assumed that\nPeter knew about his wife\u2019s status, explained\nthat her health had gone downhill\nbecause HIV care had been withdrawn\nfrom his company\u2019s medical insurance\npolicy, forcing her to stop routine antiretroviral\ntherapy.\nFearing the worst but determined to get\nit over with, Peter got tested for the virus.\nEven though he had prepared himself for\nthe worst, when the tests came back positive,\nhe was devastated.\nFor nine months, long after his wife had\ndied, he wrestled with denial, not talking\nabout the disease to anyone, not even\nclose relatives and friends,\nand refusing to take the\nappropriate medication.\nEventually, tired\nof fighting a losing\nbattle, Peter finally\ndecided to accept\nhis condition and\ndo everything he\ncould to prolong\nhis life, if only for\nthe sake of his children.\nHe also decided to\ngo public about his\nstatus. The first person\nhe approached\nwas his employer. He\nmade an impassioned\nplea to his immediate\nbosses, whom he\nasked to make a case\nfor re-introducing HIV care in the medical\ninsurance scheme.\n\u201cARVs were not free then and I was using\nabout Sh15,000 to manage the virus\nevery month, which was too expensive,\u201d\nhe says.\nHi boldness paid off. Not only was HIV\ncare re-introduced in the medical scheme,\nPeter was reimbursed all the money he\nhad spent on medication.\n\u201cIf there were other employees living\nwith the virus, I am glad that I did something\nto lighten their financial burden of\nmanaging the virus,\u201d he says.\nThis positive reaction is what gave birth\nto the idea of starting an initiative that\nwould sensitise people around his home\narea in Migori, Nyanza, about HIV/Aids.\n\u201cMany people still believed that HIV\ncould be spread through touch, therefore\nthose who had the virus were treated like\nlepers,\u201d he explains.\nTelling his inner circle of friends about\nhis HIV status was easier than he had\nexpected, and even though he felt emboldened\nabout finally being able to talk about\nit, he knew that he would need a double\ndose of courage to tell his children. He explains\nthat his main concern was how they\nwould handle the news.\n\u201cEvery time I decided to tell them, courage\nwould fail me and I would get out of\nthe house and weep, then tell myself that I\nwould do it later.\u201d\nOne night in 2004, when Peter and his\ndaughters were having supper, he finally\ntold them.\nWhen he was through, they immediately\nbroke into tears and one by one, left their\nmeals on the table and went to bed.\n\u201cI suspected that they had heard the\nrumours and I knew that it was important\nfor them to hear about it from me so that\nwe could figure out a way to deal with it,\u201d\nhe says.\nSally recalls this day vividly.\n\u201cHis confession just confirmed to me\nwhat people kept telling us about Dad\ndying and leaving us orphaned. I was so\ndistressed and unhappy.\u201d\nNot even her father\u2019s reassurance that\nhe would not die in the near future because\nhe was on medication and taking\ngood care of himself was enough to banish\nher fears. Aware that his assurances were\nnot enough, he decided to hold regular\n\u201ccounselling\u201d talks with them regarding\nHIV. Peter also took this opportunity to\ntalk to them about sex and contraceptives\nso that they could make informed decisions\nin future.\nSays Sally, \u201cIt took us time, but eventually,\nwe came to terms with Dad\u2019s condition,\nespecially since we now had a clearer\npicture of what HIV is and that it is possible\nto live for a very long time with it if\nyou take antiretroviral medicine and take\ncare of yourself.\u201d\nShe says that even though the ridicule\nand isolation by peers did not stop, the\nbite was more tolerable, now that they\nknew more about the disease and the fact\nthat their only parent was not about to\ndrop dead any second.\nFormidable team\nSally is 18 now, and together with her\nfather, drives a sensitisation campaign to\npromote positive living and acceptance of\npeople living with HIV. The Lake Victoria\nInitiative, which Peter started in 2009,\ntargets schools, churches, and any other\nforum that is willing to give them an audience.\nWhile her father concentrates on a\n\u201cmore mature\u201d audience, Sally targets her\npeers, whom she can relate to better and\nwhom she believes are more vulnerable to\nthe disease.\nTheir talks mostly centre on abstinence,\nsafe sex, managing stigma, as well as how\nto support relatives and friends with HIV.\n\u201cI know from experience how difficult\nit is to co-exist with others if you are HIV\npositive or if a close relative has the disease,\nespecially if the people around you\nare ignorant about the illness,\u201d says Sally.\nIt is for this reason that she uses every\nopportunity she gets to demystify the\nillness, which she understands only too\nwell.\nSally, who scored an A-minus in her\nKCSE examinations last year, will join\nuniversity next year, where she plans to\nstudy economics. Though she suspects\nthat her studies will keep her quite busy,\nshe still intends to keep spreading awareness\nof HIV and Aids.\nAccording to the National Aids Control\nCouncil (NACC), the infection rate of HIV\nin Migori County is among the highest in\nNyanza Province. More alarming is the\nhigh rate of infection among school-going\nchildren. This has been blamed on\nincreased sexual activity with little sex\neducation for pupils.\nNACC attributes this high rate of infection\nto adults who prey on school children\nand young girls due to the easy money\navailable along the beaches of Lake Victoria\nfrom fishing.\nSIGNED AN MOU WITH HIV\nTalking about how he takes care of himself,\nPeter says that he maintains a well-balanced\nlifestyle.\nThis includes a healthy diet, antiretrovirals,\nexercise, adequate rest, and\ndropping bad habits such as taking\nexcessive alcohol.\n\u201cHIV is a very jealous virus,\ntherefore, if you are\ninfected, you need\nto be very cautious of\nopportunistic diseases,\nwhich can kill you very fast if not well managed.\u201d\nStress, he points out, is also quite\ndangerous and can undermine your health.\nA well-established network of friends\nand people living with HIV like him has also\nplayed a significant role in ensuring that he\nleads an accountable lifestyle since they are\ncharged with the duty of reminding one\nanother of what is expected of them.\nWhen he found out about his status, Peter\nwas pretty sure that he would not remarry.\nHe has since had a change of heart however.\n\u201cI am considering it now that my children\nare grown up and will be leaving home soonto start their own lives \u2014 loneliness is not a\ngood thing,\u201d he laughs.\nHis first born daughter has completed\nschool and is working, while his second\ndaughter is in her final year at university.\nThat leaves Sally, who will join university\nnext year.\nPeter believes that he contracted HIV in\nthe early 1990s when he worked as a field\nofficer, a job that kept him away from home\nfor long periods.\n\u201cI see no other way the virus would have\ncome into my marriage, although trying to\nestablish that is now irrelevant,\u201d he says.d will be leaving home soon"}
