{"text": "September 29,\u00a02013\nMan\u2019s resolve to love wife despite opposite HIV status \nBy GRIFFINS OMWENGA @gomwenga gomwenga@ke.nationmedia.com\nChristine Atieno (not her real name) is HIV positive. \nHer husband, Cliff Odongo, 65, is HIV negative. \nMr Odongo (not his real name) has been living with his 58-year-old wife as a discordant couple.\nThe couple, who have been married for over 30 years, said that their relationship had not been changed by the disease in spite of Atieno urging her husband to find a healthy second wife, to continue leading a normal sexual life.\n\u201cI have been urging my husband to get married to another woman but he has always refused saying that I didn\u2019t get the disease from another man and according to him, this is just God\u2019s plan,\u201d she said.\nTheir love goes back to their youthful days where Odongo said Atieno accepted to marry him despite a physical disability.\u2028\u201cAs you can see, I have a shorter leg and I walk with a limp. Again I am shorter than my wife, but I love her very much and she has shown me the same affection,\u201d said Odongo.\nHe noted that he was not returning a favour by continuing to love and live with his wife despite her condition, but he simply cared about her.\n\u201cMy wife urged me to get married to another woman when she realised that she had the disease but I have never imagined living with any other woman other than her,\u201d said Odongo.\nCLEAR CONSCIENCE \nThe couple revealed that they do not use condoms.\n\u201cI cannot and I have never used a condom with my wife. As long as my conscience is clear that she did not go out there to look for the virus, why should I use a condom,\u201d he posed.\nMr Odongo added that Atieno was his wife and he did not mind if they died at the same time.\nThe couple who come from Voi in Taita Taveta County has nine grown children."}
