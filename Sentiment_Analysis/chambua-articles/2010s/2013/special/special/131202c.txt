In case you are found positive, be ready to be put on a strict drug regime,\u201d he added.\nIn an interview with the Nation, the county executive in-charge of Health, Dr Lawrence Oteng, said the youth who were sexually active were the most affected.\n\u201cMany of our youth form the bulk of those getting new infections and which we must control,\u201d said Dr Oteng.\nHe noted that if the youth could abstain from irresponsible sexual behaviour, then the county\u2019s HIV infection rate would drastically reduce.\nDr Oteng said although majority of youth were aware of the disease, they still got lured into unprotected sex, adding that the county had embarked on an initiative to send a message of prevention to schools and colleges in the region.\n\u201cWe want to target peer groups in schools besides involving parents,\u201d he said.\nThe Health executive revealed that the other target group was pregnant women since only 50 per cent had been placed under the programme to prevent transmission to the child.\nHe also complained of lack of support from religious leaders.
