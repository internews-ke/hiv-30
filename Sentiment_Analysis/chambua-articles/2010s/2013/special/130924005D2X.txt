{"text": "Tests on monkeys raise hope of HIV cure \nAn experimental vaccine tested on 16\nmonkeys protected only nine of them, but it\nalso did something curious \u2014 eliminating the\nvirus completely in those that were cured\n\n\u201cKafkaesque\u201d is not a\nword normally used to\ndescribe immune responses,\nbut it\u2019s how Dr Louis J.\nPicker described what his\nexperimental vaccine did to\nhis rhesus monkeys: \u201cIt\u2019s\nlike their T-cells were turned\ninto the East German secret\npolice, hunting down infected\ncells until there were none\nleft.\u201dRecent work by Picker,\na vaccine expert at Oregon\nHealth & Science University,\nhas shaken up the long,\nfrustrating search for an\nAIDS vaccine. Picker tested\nhis vaccine in 16 monkeys\nwho were then infected with\nsimian immunodeficiency\nvirus, a close relative of HIV,\nwhich normally would have\nsent them spiraling rapidly\ndown to a miserable death.\nThe experimental vaccine\nprotected only nine of them,\nbut it also did something never\nseen before: These monkeys\nslowly \u201ccleared\u201d the virus\nand now appear to be cured.\n\u201cThree years later, you can\u2019t\ntell them from other monkeys,\u201d\nPicker said.\nDr Anthony S. Fauci, the\nhead of the National Institute\nfor Allergy and Infectious\nDiseases, said the effect was\n\u201cunique.\u201d\nAnd Dr Barton F. Haynes, the\ndirector of the Human Vaccine\nInstitute at Duke University\u2019s\nmedical school, said it\nwas \u201cpotentially extremely\nimportant to understand how\nthis happened.\u201d\nScientists often test ideas\nfor potential AIDS vaccines\nby creating similar ones\nagainst SIV. Never before has\none eliminated an existing\ninfection. In that sense, the\neffect of Picker\u2019s vaccine was\nless like that of a measles or\nflu shot and more like that\nof the AIDS cures used in\ntwo famous cases, known as\nthe Berlin patient and the\nMississippi baby.\nThe Berlin patient, Timothy\nRay Brown, was infected\nwith HIV and cured only\nby obliterating his immune\nsystem to defeat his leukemia,\nand then injecting bone\nmarrow from a donor with a\nrare HIV-blocking mutation.\nThe unidentified baby was\nborn to an infected mother in\nMississippi and apparently\ninfected with HIV, but then\ncured with early and large\ndoses of antiretroviral drugs.\nBoth now appear to have no\nHIV lurking deep in their\nbodies, but it is impossible to\nbe sure because not every bit\nof their tissue can be tested.\nBecause he works with\nmonkeys, Picker was able\nto do something that would\nbe unthinkable with human\npatients \u2014 necropsy them,\ngrind up every organ and take\n240 samples from each to be\nsure that they harbored no\nhidden virus. Making vaccines\nby simply weakening the virus\nthat causes AIDS has failed\nbecause the virus mutates a\nhundred times faster than even\nthe fast-mutating flu virus. In\nPicker\u2019s vaccine, SIV genes are\nfused to those of another virus,\nthe cytomegalovirus. (The\nname means \u201cbig cell,\u201d and\nit is in the herpes family but\ndifferent from its relatives that\ncause lip and genital sores,\nchickenpox and shingles.)\nHIV fusion has been tried with\nadenoviruses and others, but\ncytomegalovirus seems to\nwork better. It\u2019s not entirely\nclear why, but one theory is\nthat cytomegalovirus has a\nvery long history of infecting\nprimates \u2014so much so that\n100 per cent of monkeys and\nabout 80 per cent of humans\nget it in their lifetimes.\nTherefore, we primates have\nadapted to it. Although the\nvirus can be lethal to fetuses\nand to those with immune\nsystems suppressed by\nAIDS or transplant drugs,\nin most victims it causes no\nsymptoms.The body responds\nto cytomegalovirus more\nslowly and calmly than it does,\nfor example, to a flu.\nAs in any infection, the\nthymus gland generates new\nwhite blood cells called T cells\n\u2014 in this case, CD8 hunterkiller\ncells \u2014 primed to target\nthe specific virus. But in\nthe case of Picker\u2019s vaccine,\nthose cells stay in an unusual\n\u201chalf-alert\u201d state. A full-blown\nimmune response eventually\nexhausts itself, and can even\nbe dangerous. For example,\nthe rare humans who catch\nH5N1 bird flu often die of the\nimmune response itself; they\ndrown in the flood of CD8s\nand other would-be saviors\npouring into the lung tissue,\nspoiling for a fight.\nThat \u201chalf-alert\u201d state is\nthe \u201cKafkaesque\u201d element:\nunactivated CD8s wander\naround aimlessly, while fully\nactivated ones behave like\nstorm troopers. But the\nhalf-activated CD8s persist\nin tissues, eliminating their\ntargets quietly without\ntriggering inflammation\nor even a mild fever. When\nSIV genes are fused to the\ncytomegalovirus spine, the\nCD8s kill SIV-infected cells\ntoo.Since it protected only\nsome monkeys, the new\ntechnique might be best used\nin combination approaches.\nFor example, Fauci said, it\ncould be given with a vaccine\nthat generates antibodies\nagainst HIV \u201cand maybe\neliminate the cells that sneak\npast the antibody shield.\u201d\nAlternatively, the vaccine\nmight be given to infected\npatients who are on\nantiretroviral drugs to see\nif it can \u201cmop up\u201d lingering\nreservoirs of virus.It should\ntake up to three years to get a\nhuman version ready for trials,\nPicker estimated.\n\u201cNow the outstanding\nquestion is, \u2018Why only half?\u2019\u201d\nsaid Dr Mike McCune,\nan AIDS researcher at the\nUniversity of California, San\nFrancisco, referring to the\nmonkeys who were protected\nin Picker\u2019s trial.\nToo often, AIDS advances that\nwork in lots of monkeys don\u2019t\nwork in many humans.\n\u201cNot all monkeys are the\nsame,\u201d McCune said. \u201cThey\u2019re\nnot as inbred as mice, but\nthey\u2019re sometimes from the\nsame families, they get the\nsame diets. ... Who knows\nwhat will happen if this goes\ninto humans?\u201d (NYT)"}
