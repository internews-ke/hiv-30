The report further\nprojects HIV-related deaths this\nyear to be approximately 26,720.\nThe drop is associated with\nawareness through the media\nand other channels on the use of\nanti-retrovirals and information on\nhealthy living.\nHowever, these deaths would be\nlower if prominent personalities\ncame out openly about their HIV\nstatus and how they are able to\ncope with life, Dr Mulindi said.\nThe prominent people include\npoliticians, DJs, musicians, actors,\nactresses, bishops and others. Professionals\nwere asked to disclose\ntheir status to inspire infected\npeople that they too can work."}
