{"text": "I KNOW HOW FORTUNATE I AM\n\nTo all the women who\u2019ve lost their\nlives giving birth\nIT IS A fact that we have a high maternal\nmortality rate. For many Kenyan women,\nthere is no guarantee that once you go\ninto the delivery room, you will walk out\nalive.\nThis thought was always at the top of\nmy mind during the four times I went\ninto the delivery room, even though I did\nnot allow fear to paralyse me.\nI have had several miscarriages that\nhave left me with unseen scars, which\nI have yet to come to terms with. Many\nmothers-to-be already have names for\ntheir unborn babies \u2014 I know I did. I am\na Christian. I am pro-life. I believe, like\nmy Bible says, that God knows us when\nwe are still inside our mothers\u2019 wombs.\nMy miscarriages were not mere statistics;\nthey were babies who had names.\nFor many women living with HIV, giving\nbirth can be, if all caution is thrown to\nthe wind, a matter of life and death.\nThat is why I cannot emphasise enough\nthat you should not just plunge into it\nheadlong because Asunta has done it\nfour times and come out unscathed.\nRemember, you do not just want a\nbaby: you also want to remain alive and\nhealthy to love and hold your baby for\nas long as possible. For me, that is the\nwhole essence of motherhood.\nThe other side of HIV contraction\nThings going wrong in a labour ward can\nnegatively affect an entire family. Years\nago, I had a friend who contracted HIV\nwhen she went to give birth.\nShe was being attended by nursing\nstudents. Believe it or not, they\nused surgical instruments that were\ncontaminated. What she knows is that\nshe entered that ward HIV-negative, and\ncame out HIV-positive. And she only\nfigured this out months later.\n\u201cMy husband refused to hear my side of\nthe story and swore that there was more\nto it than I was telling him,\u201d she told me\nwhen she came to see me.\n\u201cOur baby is HIV-negative and so is his\nfather \u2014 it is hard for me to deal with\nthis fact.\u201d\nThis woman \u2014 and I know there are\nothers \u2014 had a tough time dealing\nwith it and accepting her status. Why,\nin group therapies where people who\nshared how they had been infected\nby HIV, most of the experiences had\nsomething to do with sex. She could not\nfind anyone to relate with.\nSpeaking of which, another member\nwho contracted HIV after being raped\nalso had an emotional roller coaster\nwhile sharing her experience. I think\nthis is the other side of HIV contraction.\nThese are stories, often untold, of\npeople living with HIV who always feel\n\u201cinnocent\u201d. (In the past, we used to refer\nto children living with HIV as \u201cinnocents\u201d.\nThen we realised that, though we had\nthe best of intentions, this would infer\nthat there are persons living with HIV\nwho are \u201cguilty\u201d, which is not true. So\nthe \u201cinnocent\u201d moniker was struck off\nthe vocabulary).\nLast-minute jitters\nFor me, this time round I would say\neverything went well, except at the last\nminute. And it came from the leastexpected\nquarter. I was scared because\nthe hospital I was to give birth in was in\nthe news for all the wrong reasons. The\nwife of someone prominent had died\nwhile giving birth there and, if it were up\nto me, I would have changed my plans.\nBut I had done everything there \u2014 clinics\nand prevention of mother-to-child\ntransmission.\nThere was no way I could now take my\nfile and up and leave. It is not like college\ncredits that can be transferred. I would\nhave to do a raft of tests, which would\ntake time and money. And which my\ndoctor politely told me was impossible.\nI delivered at this hospital, and\neverything went just fine for me. For this,\nI am thankful to God, the doctors, and all\nthose who whispered prayers for me.\nI know that many mothers and babies\ndo not make it. And I know that I am\nfortunate because, even in the best\nhands in the world, things can go wrong.\nMy heart goes out to this family who lost\na mother and wife, and to all those other\ncountless unnamed women who give\ntheir lives to bring forth new lives.\nFor many women living with HIV, giving\nbirth can be a matter of life and death if\nthey fail to take precautions . FILE\nCHILD BIRTH\nMaternal health in\nKenya\nAccording to a 2010 survey by the\nKenya Service Provision Assessment,\nan estimated 56 per cent of pregnant\nwomen deliver at home, most without\nassistance from a trained provider.\nThis is in part responsible for\nKenya\u2019s high maternal mortality rate,\nwhich the Kenya demographic health\nSurvey, 2009, put at approximately\n488 per 100,000 live births, one of\nthe highest in the world.\nAccording to Dr Lennie Bazira Kyomuhangi,\nthe country director at the\nAfrican Medical Research Foundation,\n(AMREF), the mortality toll in\nKenya varies geographically, and can\nBe\nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura,\na mother of five who tested positive\n23 years ago.
