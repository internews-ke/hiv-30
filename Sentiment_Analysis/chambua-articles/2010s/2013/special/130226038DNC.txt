{"text": "New kit to make male \u2018cut\u2019 painless\nBY NATION\nCORRESPONDENT\nKisumu\nPainless male circumcision\ncould soon become a reality if\npilot studies on a new device\nare successful.\nThe device, known as\nPrePex, is used alongside an\nanaesthetic cream to peel off\nforeskin without bleeding.\nIt is poised to increase the\nnumber of male adults going\nfor the cut as it is faster than\ncurrent methods.\nSome 425 men, aged 18 to\n49, have enrolled for the study\nto be launched next week in\nvarious health centres in\nNyanza. The research will\ntake four months.\nSafer than other methods\nSimilar studies in Rwanda,\nUganda and Zimbabwe have\nshowed that circumcision by\nPrePex is safer than other\nmethods.\nDr Peter Cherutich, the director\nof HIV prevention at National\nAids and STI Control Programme,\nsaid initial safety studies done in\nthe three countries showed that\nless blood is shed when PrePex is\nused compared to other methods\ncurrently in use.\nPrePex uses the elastic rubber\nband to remove foreskin\nfrom the penis.\n\u2018\u2018The band compresses the\nforeskin against a plastic ring\nslipped inside it; the foreskin\ndies within hours for lack of\nblood and after a week falls off,\u201d\nsaid Dr Cherutich during the\nlaunch of the device for study\ntrials at Lumumba Health Centre\nin Kisumu. Research has\nshown that male cut reduces\nchances of HIV infection."}
