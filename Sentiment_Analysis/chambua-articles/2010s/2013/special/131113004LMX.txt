{"text": "Faith is my kind of hero\n\nNOTHING HAPPENS JUST for the heck\nof it. When I met Faith 20 or so years ago,\nI did not know I would later need her. I often\nwondered why on earth a young woman like\nher would go out of her way to keep desperate\nbabies in her apartment in Kayole. Was it\nnot wise to rent it out and make money?\nI later learnt that Faith had named her children\u2019s\nhome Imani, which is Kiswahili for her\nfirst name. How appropriate. As fate would\nhave it, I found myself caring for babies that\nhad no one else. I did not know where to turn,\nespecially when HIV-positive mothers died\nunder our care. I had put all attention on the\nrecovery of the mothers and forgotten about\nthe vulnerable children. I was still na\u00efve and\nnever attended to even a single child\u2019s case,\nexpecting that I would lose.\nSo it came as an emergency when I found\nmyself with babies without caregivers. Most\ntimes I did not know where else to turn but to\nFaith for custody and upkeep.\nFaith\u2019s labour of love\nYou will not find Faith calling press conferences\nto express her opinion on children\u2019s\npredicament or the myriad challenges she\nfaces. She does her best to ensure that these\nchildren live humane lives. In essence, she\nis rescuing our abandoned future leaders.\nIf there are people who deserve tickets to\nheaven because of the selfless work they\ndo on earth, it is Faith and her staff at Imani\nChildren\u2019s Homes. She has a big, big accommodating\nheart. These folks are nurturing\nover 3,000 children ranging from days old to\nsome at university.\nThere is another side to Faith that I admire.\nAs opposed to KENWA (read me), she takes\nin any needy baby. Personally, to take or consider\na child\u2019s case, HIV must be mentioned\nsomewhere to justify it. It is either HIV or\nthe highway. To us, the child qualifies to be\nneedy if both parents are dead and relatives\nare MIA. Even under such circumstances,\nwe demand a letter from the local chief if\nwe cannot get a death certificate indicating\nimmune suppression\u2026 or such terms that\n\u201cbaptise\u201d Aids-related deaths.\nWalk of faith\nWhen I recently visited Faith in Kayole, she\ntold me she is organising a walk from Nairobi\nto Malindi to raise funds to build a nyumba ya\nwazee. Her workers are old and have nowhere\nto go. She wanted\nme to support her\nin whatever way I\ncould.\n\u201cFaith, I\ncan\u2019t even attempt to walk from Kayole to\nEmbakasi,\u201d I sighed.\n\u201cNo,\u201d she went ahead with her usual smile,\nas if indicating that I cannot walk even three\nmetres to save my life. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to\nwalk; I just want you to flag it off.\u201d\nFaith has scheduled it for 1 December,\nwhich is World Aids Day (WAD). I asked her\nwhy she had settled on, of all days, WAD.\n\u201cNo one ever told me 1 December is, er,\nWAD,\u201d she countered.\nFaith is not pretentious. She has no time\nto catch up with the same old same old \u201crecurrent\u201d\naffairs. Her world consists of babies\nfrom all walks of life.\n\u201cAsunta, please tell your friends about this\nwalk so that they can join us.\u201d\nMe? I do not want to merely tell you about\nFaith\u2019s walk. I want to toot the horn of this\nunsung heroine who has committed her\nlife to rescuing our needy children. She has\nsacrificed wifely and biological mother ambitions\nand in return has become the mother of\nmultitudes. Faith once told me that she cannot\neven keep a relationship.\n\u201cWhich brother will date a sister with over\n3,000 children all calling her Mom? When will\nshe even have time for him?\u201d\nSpeaking of time, Faith\u2019s daily focus is how\nto get food, (formula) milk, clothes, firewood,\nand getting her sick children to hospital. As\nif that is not enough, she is always being\ncalled to take in more abandoned babies.\nAt times she gets children who really need\nspecial care. Recently Faith got a baby with\nno genital organs. They had to do a quick\nsurgery to allow passage of stool and urine.\nMore surgery is scheduled for the limbless\nand genderless angel. After delivery, the\nbaby\u2019s mother walked away. She refused\nto have anything to do with the malformed\nbaby. Faith says the baby is her favourite. Do\nnot ask me why.\nI appreciate and celebrate this woman. I do\nnot know how those who select our national\nheroes pass over Faith.\nIf you are reading this, kindly support this\nunsung hero in her walk and work.\nSHE IS THE MOTHER OF 3,000 CHILDREN\nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura,\na mother-of-five who tested HIVpositive\n26 years ago. She is the executive\ndirector of the Kenya Network\nof Women with Aids (KENWA). Email:"}
