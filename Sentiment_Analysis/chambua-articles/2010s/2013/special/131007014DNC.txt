{"text": "Science fails to support benefits often associated with male circumcision\n\nPraising male circumcision\nin Kenya, especially in Luo\nNyanza, seems to be the\nnorm. Even vernacular radio stations\nare awash with its \u201cbenefits\u201d,\nyet there is no scientific evidence to\nthe effect.\nSiaya County chairman of Health\nCommittee Mathew Odeny has\ndrafted a Bill to guide the circumcision\nof male infants so as to stem\nHIV infections (Nation, October 3).\nMy objection to such moves is not\nbased on culture but on science.\nThe foreskin has protective,\nsensory and sexual functions. It\nprotects the body from harmful\nbacteria and viruses. There is a\ngland in the foreskin known as\napocrine that produces anti-bacterial\nand anti-viral proteins such as\nlyzozyme.\nIt is found within the mucus that\nlies between the glans and foreskin,\nand protects against infections like\nHIV. Yet it is this mucus that some\npeople who are pro-circumcision\nbrand as a dirty carrier of germs\nthat facilitate HIV infection.\nMucus membranes that line all\nbody orifices like the nose, vagina,\nand ear are the first immunological\ndefence. To regard this mucus as\ndirty is to disregard science.\nThe foreskin protects the glans\nin the same way the eyelids protect\nthe eyes. It keeps the glans moist\nand sensitive. It is this sensitivity\nthat causes sexual pleasure.\nThe foreskin contains 20,000 to\n70,000 erogenous nerve endings,\nwhich encircle the inner openings\nof the foreskin. Circumcision\nremoves over 75 per cent of\nthese nerve endings, resulting in\npremature ejaculation or erectile\ndysfunction.\nThe moisture provided by the\nforeskin facilitates the gliding action\nof the penis that reduces friction\nand vaginal dryness, thus enhances\norgasm for both partners.\nThe foreskin contains an erotogenic\nsensory nerve-receptor system\nthat transmits sexual sensation\nto the central nervous system and\nbrain to release hormones into the\nblood stream that reduce stress.\nWhen doctors are absorbed in\nmale circumcision without giving\nbalanced scientific information as\nit happens in Nyanza (Refer too, to\nNation, November 16, 2012, p. 35),\nit leaves a lot of question marks in\nthe minds of people who like their\nculture to be maintained.\n\u201cWhy did nature provide the\nmale offspring with the foreskin?\nWhat are the surgical uses of the\nforeskin? What are the theories behind\nthe genesis of circumcision?\u201d\nIn the past, for example, the appendix\nwas considered an inconsequential\norgan but it has now been\nproved that it helps in the body\u2019s\nimmune system.\nWhy must people be informed on\nresearch supporting male circumcision\nbut not on research dismissing\nmale circumcision?\nATIENO KILI, Nairobi"}
