{"text": "\nTHIS VIRUS DOESN\u2019T RESPECT ANYBODY\n\nMr President, is HIV on\nyour national agenda?\n\nDEAR SIR,\nI want to talk to you, not as an activist, but as a mother. First, congratulations for the 100-plus days in office. I can imagine how tough it must be to work for the entire country. I work with a communitybased organisation that reaches about 60,000 households. It gives me sleepless nights, so I cannot fathom what you are up against.\nI was wondering if I could get a visit to State House. If only you found time\nin your super-busy schedule, I would share some things with you face to face without the media and the intimidating security detail. The issues I want to talk about concern the very life of this blessed nation.\nI am concerned, Mr President. I have not heard a single comment from you on HIV. Is it out of fear or you simply do not want to mention it?\nIt would be remarkable if in the meetings you go to, you say how you are championing the fight and struggle to defeat Aids and how you are helping orphans and vulnerable children, widows and grandmothers. It is hard to interpret what your silence on the matter means.\nAs a person living with HIV, at times\nI feel threatened in a very personal way. My life hangs on political will and financial support of other nations, other\nthan my own country. Sir, does it worry anyone in your government that today if\nthe (US) President\u2019s Emergency Plan for\nAids Relief (PEPFAR) or the Global Fund withdrew funding to antiretroviral therapy\n(ART), my days would be numbered? What is more, my five boys, four of whom escaped HIV courtesy of antiretrovirals, would join the statistics of orphans in Kenya. This also applies to almost halfa- million other people living with HIV and on ART. It applies to the nearly 800,000 others waiting to be put on treatment.\nWhat is your government doing about this?\nThere is the financial support for vulnerable groups every two or so months.\nHowever, this is not realistic, considering\nthe challenges these citizens bear. I mean, a kilogramme of flour costs the same for everyone, irrespective of the level of income.\nI urge you to put your foot down\nand introduce an affordable package for these people, especially children. This will make them aware of your personal concern and commitment about their issues.\nSir, kindly advise the Ministry of Education that when they select top students\nto join national schools, there should be a slot for such children. They may not\nperform as well as their counterparts because of antiretrovirals, which affect their brains. Regardless, they deserve a\nchance.\nI take antiretroviral drugs. At times I cannot remember what I read only a few seconds before. God knows how these children keep their memories active for tough exams. It is no wonder that some perform poorly in school. Still, they are our children and we owe them justice and love.\nTo date, no single parliamentarian nor high office holder has publicly declared their HIV status. I am not insinuating\nanything. I know there is such a thing as stigma and denial in high places. This\nvirus does not respect anybody. Our leaders\nwho are living with HIV need help,\nalthough they may not say it because\nthey do not want to lose face with the\nelectorate.\nI know this is difficult, Mr President, but\nI wish you could set up a parliamentary\npost-test club. For those who test HIVpositive,\nsomething needs to be done\nso that their positions do not become an\nimpediment for them to tell publicly how\nthey are living positively.\nYour father, Jomo Kenyatta, mentioned\nelimination of disease as one of this\ncountry\u2019s development priorities. He did\nnot know about Aids. He would turn in his\ngrave if you allowed his granddaughter,\nNgina, to live in fear of contracting HIV.\nMr President, if today my son,\nPeter, met and proposed to Ngina, and\nthis could happen, I am sure you would\nwant to know my son\u2019s HIV status. This\nworry can be a thing of the past if your\ngovernment makes smart and strategic\ninvestments towards ensuring universal\naccess to Aids treatment services, zero\nnew infections, zero Aids-related deaths,\nand zero stigma.\nI would not want my children and\nfuture generations to go through what I\ndid. This is the reason I call for not only\nyour personal attention, but also a policy\ncommitment to this national cause.\nFinally, please tweet my twin boys,\nBaraka and Gabriel, happy five months.\nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother-of-five who tested HIV-positive 26\nyears ago. She is the executive director of the Kenya Network of Women with\nAids (KENWA). Email: asuntawagura@hotmail.com"}
