{"text": "LUCKING OUT, STRIKING OUT AND BAILING OUT\nWho will water the\nseeds of hope?\nWHEN CATHERINE* CALLED ME saying she wanted to see me because no one\nunderstood her, I granted her audience. Catherine is a mother of two boys: a nineyear-\nold who is HIV-positive, and an eight-year-old who is negative.\nComing from an underprivileged background, Catherine lucked out, or so she\nthought, when she met a matatu driver.\n\u201cI sat in the front seat, and the driver was quick to strike up a conversation. Before\nlong, we were chatting like old buddies.\u201d\nAs they say, \u201cone thing led to another\u201d. Soon, they were living as husband and\nwife, despite her parents\u2019 protestations.\nAt Kenwa (Kenya Network of Women with Aids), we\u2019re keen on economically\nempowering our members. Through seed money, we help underprivileged clients to\nstart income-generating activities (IGAs).\nOur IGA programme has myriad challenges though. One is greenness. Most\nclients who access seed capital don\u2019t have the basic know-how to run sustainable\nbusinesses.\nThe other one that comes quickly to mind is the usual suspect: HIV. When we\ngive our members seed capital, most have just recuperated from opportunistic\ninfections. Or, they\u2019re caring for\nloved ones living with HIV. Caught\nbetween offering care and support\nand minding a fledgling business,\nthe former always wins.\nNo free rides\nCatherine\u2019s husband was extremely\nloving and kind\u2026 until she\nannounced that she was pregnant.\n\u201cWhy are young girls so careless\nnowadays, getting pregnant\nanywhere and anyhow simply because\nthey\u2019ve been offered a place\nto stay?\u201d the man raved.\nCatherine was beaten and ordered\nto pack and leave. Her parents\ntook the matter to the wazee,\nand the man was fined Sh50,000\nand ordered to keep his wife and\nunborn child. He paid Sh20,000\nand they went back home.\nWhen she was three months\npregnant, Catherine started to\nattend antenatal clinics. She was excited\nabout having her baby, even if\nthe timing had not been planned. After\na few visits, it was time to get the\nresults of her HIV test, which is mandatory in prenatal clinics. Everything had been\nexplained to her but still, \u201cas far as I was concerned, I was very far from HIV\u201d.\nCatherine was shocked when the nurse-in-charge told her she was HIV-positive.\nOn breaking the news to her husband, he accused her of having known it prior to\ntheir meeting.\n\u201cWhy else did you go for the test?\u201d he berated her. \u201cIt was so that you could\nblame me, and I\u2019m not going to take that.\u201d\nAt week 28, Catherine was put on medication to prevent mother-to-child transmission\nof HIV. She packed her things and returned to her parents\u2019 home but she\nnever returned to the clinic. When the baby was born, he tested HIV-positive.\n\u201cAfter I shared this with my family members, they quickly sent me back to where\nI had \u2018collected it\u2019. I returned to my husband and forced myself to stay as I took care\nof my sickly son. And then I conceived again.\u201d\nSomeone had misinformed her that she could not conceive while breastfeeding.\n\u201cMy husband lost it. He expected me to \u2018take care of things\u2019 and not get pregnant\nagain. He sent me packing once more.\n\u201cI spent cold nights on the streets before someone referred me to Kenwa.\u201d\nThree strikes\nWe have settled Catherine in a small room. However, for the second time her grocery\nbusiness has flopped. I know where she\u2019s coming from: when her son falls ill,\nshe abandons everything and solely focuses on him. That\u2019s what mothers do.\nI don\u2019t know how to communicate this to those who fund us. At times, no matter\nhow determined a client is to succeed, things don\u2019t always turn up trumps. Besides,\nKenwa\u2019s economic empowerment policy is firm: you can\u2019t be supported multiple\ntimes if your business fails.\nIn fact, I\u2019ve had to support Catherine from my own wallet for the second time.\nShe\u2019s coming for a third helping, and I don\u2019t know how to proceed.\nThis isn\u2019t just about Catherine, though. It\u2019s about us. Catherine is merely the human\nface of issues facing millions of underprivileged Kenyan women.\nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother-of-three who tested HIV-positive\n23 years ago.
