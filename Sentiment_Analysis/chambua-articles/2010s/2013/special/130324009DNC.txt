{"text": "MORALITY | Debate rages on the suitability of an advertisement urging women to use prophylactics\nCrisis meeting\ncalled over\ncondom use\nadvert on TV\nReligious leaders\nsay public campaign\nmay encourage sex\noutside marriage\nBY TOM MOSOBA\ntmosoba@tz.nationmedia.com\nThe National Aids Control\nCouncil has convened\nan impromptu board\nmeeting tomorrow to address\nraging controversy generated\nby a controversial condom use\nadvertisement on national\ntelevision.\nNACC director Alloys\nOrago says the board has been\nsummoned to respond to the\nheat generated by opposition\nto \u201cWeka Condom Mpangoni\u201d,\na public campaign encouraging\ncondom use among women in\nsexual relationships outside\nmarriage.\nPopulation Service\nInternational, the sponsors,\nsuspended airing of the advert\non March 19 amid mounting\nprotests from a cross-section\nof religious leaders. Debate\nfor and against the condom\ncampaign is still raging in the\nsocial media.\nIn an interview with the\nSunday Nation, Prof Orago\nsaid the NACC meeting will\nconsider different views and\ncome up with a common\nposition on how to promote\ncondom use as a means of\npreventing HIV infections.\nThe advert was informed\nby research that shows that\nmarried couples are three times\nmore likely to be infected with\nHIV compared to prostitutes.\nOffending message\n\u201cWe have temporarily pulled\nthe advert, and Monday\u2019s\nmeeting will help us understand\nthe offending messages and\ninform the campaigners on\nhow to proceed,\u201d said Prof\nOrago.\nBut he said health authorities\nwere taken aback by the stiff\nopposition, including from\nreligious leaders who have a\nrepresentative on the NACC\nBoard.\nAccording to the NACC\nchief, the advert was created\nfollowing research that showed\nnew HIV/Aids infections are\nsteadily rising among married\ncouples and those with steady\nsexual partners. Women, long\nconsidered a low risk group,\ncomprise the highest number\nof those being infected while in\napparently stable unions.\n\u201cWe have scientific findings\nto prove this, and that is why\nthis particular advert was\ndeveloped to encourage them\nto use condoms in their sexual\nliaisons. We did not just move\nfrom the blue, and we cannot\nwin the war against Aids by\nnot targeting both sexes,\u201d\nProf Orago said.\nNational Aids and STI\nControl Programme head Peter\nCherutich said the public was\nover-reacting and appealed for\nsupport and understanding\nfrom religious leaders.\n\u201cIt is now apparent that\nsome women in seemingly\nstable marriages do cheat on\ntheir partners, and the nation\ncan no longer continue to bury\nits head in the sand,\u201d he said\nin an earlier interview with\nNTV.\nA new Aids epidemic status\nreport for Kenya gives grim\nstatistics which the authorities\nsay informed the creation of\nthe condom campaign.\nThe Kenya AIDS epidemic\nUPDATE 2012 report is\ndescribed as the first-ever\ncomprehensive update of the\nHIV and Aids epidemic in the\ncountry over the last decade.\nWhile steady progress has been\nmade in scaling back effects\nof the epidemic, the analysis\npaints a worrying trend in\ninfections. The findings warn\nthat more than 44.1 per cent\nof all new HIV infections are\noccurring in stable or longterm\nrelationships including\nmarriages.\nSixty five per cent of recent\ninfections occurred among\nwomen under 35 years while\n40.1 per cent for men aged\nbetween 35-44 years were\nvictims. The publication said\n104,137 Kenyans were infected\nin 2011.\nSurprisingly, married\ncouples are three times more\nlikely to become infected than\nprostitutes who accounted for\nonly 14.05 per cent of new\ninfections. They are followed\nclosely at 20.28 per cent by\nthose engaging in casual sex\nlike one-night stands.\nPrison infections stand\nat 15.23 per cent, injecting\ndrug use at 3.83 per cent\nwhile health facility-related\ninfections are the lowest at\n2.52 per cent.\nIt is further estimated that\n45 per cent of married people\nwho are HIV positive have\npartners who are not currently\ninfected, therefore putting their\ndiscordance at great risk.\nThe main reasons given for\nhigh HIV prevalence rates in\nthese types of relationships\ninclude having more than one\nsexual partner and engaging in\nunprotected sex with a person\nof unknown HIV status.\n(The Kenya AIDS Indicator\nSurvey for 2009 showed about\n80 per cent of all persons\ninfected with HIV do not know\ntheir status). As of December\n2011, 1.6 million people in\nKenya were living with HIV.\nOther reasons include low\ncondom use in multiple and\nconcurrent sexual partnerships,\ncouples in marriage consider\nthemselves to be at low risk for\nHIV infection while some are\nstill ignorant of the risks that\ntheir partner\u2019s sexual history\nputs them in or the sexual\nnetworks created through\nrelationships on the side.\nThe controversial advert is\nseen as part of a government\nstrategy to adopt \u201cenergetic,\ncourageous efforts to address\nthe social determinants of\nvulnerability\u201d.\nBut the advert has drawn\nthe ire of religious leaders\nwho described it as immoral\nand misleading. Bishop Julius\nKalu of the Anglican Church\nof Kenya, Mombasa Diocese,\nand the Council of Imams and\nPreachers of Kenya Secretary\nSheikh Mohammed Khalifa\ncalled for its removal saying by\ndepicting women as cheaters, it\nwas encouraging unfaithfulness\nand casual sex among married\nKenyans.\nSodom and Gomorrah\n\u201cThe advert depicts this\nnation as a Sodom and\nGomorrah and not one that\nvalues the institution of\nmarriage and family,\u201d said\nSheikh Khalifa.\nBishop Kalu said: \u201cThere are\nbetter ways of passing useful\ninformation to society\u2026but\nthis one has certainly failed\nand openly propagates\nimmorality.\u201d\nIn the social media, some\ncommentators said the advert\nwas a gimmick to shore up\ncondom sales, which currently\nstand at 15 million pieces\na year. Others called for a\nsober debate on the need for\nKenyans to be God-fearing,\nadopt good morals and live\nhealthier lives."}
