The AIDS spending rose\nseven-fold between 2000-2001 and 2008-\n2009, including 18% in 2008-2009 alone.\nThe bulk of this funding estimated at 87%\nhowever, comes from development partners\nwith the government contribution estimated\nat about 13%. This rapid and unprecedented\nexpansion has led to many important gains.\nThe PMTCT programme which started as a\npilot in 2000 has expanded rapidly to cover\nover 4000 health facilities with interventions\nin both public and private health institutions.\nHIV testing and counselling is routinely\noffered to pregnant mothers attending\nantenatal clinics resulting in high uptake\nof testing. The NACC projections indicate\nthat 81,000 mothers were likely to be HIV\ninfected annually in 2009 and 2010 out of a\ntotal of 1.5 million annual pregnancies (NACC\nProjections 2010).\nAntiretroviral therapy forms a core\ncomponent of HIV care and treatment\nfor those infected with HIV among other\nsupportive interventions. Since the\nintroduction of ARVs in the public sector in\nthe late 2003, the numbers of those benefiting\nfrom active antiretroviral therapy has risen\nfrom less than 10,000 in 2003 to more than\n400,000 in 2010.This provision of free ARVs\nin public, NGO and faith based sectors has\nseen the cost of treatment to persons living\nwith HIV reduce dramatically as access to\nART has increased tremendously.\nDespite these gains, additional large\nincreases in spending for HIV prevention\nand treatment will be needed to control\nthe epidemic in the future. Without a\nrevolutionary prevention technology such\nas an effective vaccine or a curative drug,\neffective prevention methods such as male\ncircumcision, condom use, needle exchange,\nprevention of mother to child transmission\nwould need to be expanded further leading\nto increased financial outlays.\nAt the same time, demand for ART for\nadults and children with HIV infections will\ncontinue to grow rapidly. With the 2009\nWHO Treatment guidelines recommending\nan earlier initiation of ART having been\nadopted by the Kenyan Government in 2010,\nthe number of people in need of treatment\nhas significantly increased. Over 800,000\npersons are estimated to be in need of ART\nas of 2010 (117,000 children aged less than\n15 years and 694,000 adults); with over\n440,000 persons on ART as of November\n2010 (54% coverage). But, the country is\nstill not providing ART to over approximately\n46% of those in need of treatment.\nThe intensifying situation raises a series\nof difficult questions for domestic and\ninternational financing of HIV and AIDS\ninterventions. HIV and AIDS has now become\na long\u2013term problem and not a short-term\ncrisis hence some key long-term financing\nissues to be addressed by the Kenyan\nGovernment include: How large will the\nresource requirements be to combat HIV and\nAIDS effectively over the next 20 years? What\nbenefits will the country get from increased\nspending, as measured by infections averted\nand lives saved?\nCOUNTRY RESULTS\nIn the Kenya National AIDS Strategic Plan\n(KNASP III) for the period 2009 -2013,\nthe country modelled the long-term\nfinancial requirements for strengthening\nof prevention, treatment, care and support\nand related health systems. The total four\nyear programme cost (2009-2013) was\nestimated at US$3.5567 billion, with annual\nrequirements rising from US $671 million\nin 2009/10, US$ 833million in 2010/11, US\n$998million in 2011/12 and US $1,054 million\nin 2012/13. The annual increases are mostly\ndue to proposed scale \u2013up in interventions\ntargeting communities, MARPs, HCT,\nPMTCT, ART, Nutritional Support, Treatment\nof Opportunistic Infections, OVC, HIV\nProgramme Management and M&E.\nThe results of the costing model showed that\npolicy choices made in the next few years\nwould have a large effect on the course of\nthe epidemic. The rapid scale \u2013up scenario,\nincluding widespread efforts to achieve\nuniversal access to prevention and treatment\nservices demonstrated that our country\u2019s\nalready heavy financial requirements must\nincrease emphasizing the severe pressure\nthat HIV and AIDS places on available\nresource. The KNASP III showed that Kenya\u2019s\nestimated funding gap for the HIV and AIDS\nprogramme was roughly USD 1.67 billion. Of\nthe available funding, most (87%) comes from\nexternal sources, which undermines country\nownership and sustainability and constrains\nnational efforts to update intervention\npriorities and decentralize service delivery.\nThe country has to devise innovative ways\nof raising revenue domestically to enhance\nsustainability for HIV financing both in the\nimmediate and long run.\nCOUNTRY PROJECTIONS\nModelling projections can help us understand\nthe persisting nature of the HIV and\nAIDS epidemic and the need for action, including\ntargeted\ninter ventions.\nSince the first\nincidence of HIV\ninfection was\ndiagnozed in\n1984, the number\nof HIV positive\nKenyans\nhas steadily\nincreased. The\ntrend is projected\nto continue\nto a peak\nin 2015 and\nthereafter decline\ngradually if necessary interventions are\nimplemented (see Figure 1).\nThe HIV epidemic in Kenya peaked in the late\n1990s with an overall prevalence rate of over\n14% in adults which has however, declined\nto 6.3 % among those aged 15-49 years. This\nnotwithstanding, incidence remains high at\n100,000 adults and 22,000 paediatric new\ninfections every year (NACC Spectrum Modelling,\n2009).\nACTION BY GOVERNMENT OF KENYA\nOver the last decade, the government\nin collaboration with key stakeholders\nhas mounted a robust and multi-faceted\nresponse to AIDS starting with The\nSessional Paper No. 4 of 1997 on AIDS in\nKenya. The paper marked an important\nchange on the political front and outlined\na new institutional framework. In 1999,\nthe Government declared AIDS a national\ndisaster and consequently established the\nNational AIDS Control Council (NACC) within\nthe Office of the President to coordinate\nthe multisectoral National response to the\nepidemic. To reinforce its commitment, the\nGovernment in 2003 established a rightsbased\nframework for effective action on AIDS\nby approving legislation that made it illegal\nto engage in discrimination in employment\non the basis of a person\u2019s HIV status. The law\nalso prohibited insurers from withholding\nservices to people living with HIV or from\nimposing discriminatory premiums on HIVinfected\nindividuals. In 2006, the Government\nenacted the HIV and AIDS Prevention and\nControl Act (although the legislation is yet\nto be fully implemented) to formally protect\nthe rights of people living with HIV, prohibits\nmandatory HIV testing, and authorizes\nvarious measures to mitigate the epidemic\u2019s\nimpact. A declaration of \u2018Total War on AIDS\u2019\nwas one of the first acts of H. E. former\nPresident Kibaki and bringing together an\necumenical group of religious leaders has\nbeen an important step in this fight. Since the\ndeclaration, formal policies and guidelines\nhave been developed to support programme\nplanning and implementation with respect\nto specific aspects of the AIDS response.\nVarious areas are covered by different\nguidelines including antiretroviral therapy,\nvoluntary counseling and testing, sexual\nand reproductive health services for young\npeople, sectoral and gender mainstreaming\nof HIV and AIDS education in primary school\nsettings.\nIMPACT OF THE EPIDEMIC\nThe epidemic has however, caused farreaching\nsocial, economic, health and\npopulation effects. It is the main cause of a\nsharp deterioration of basic health indicators.\nFor instance, in 2009, an estimated 1.2\nmillion children in Kenya had lost one or\nboth parents to AIDS. Kenyan children with\none or more HIV-infected parents were\nsignificantly less likely than other children to\nbe in school, more likely to be underweight,\nand less likely to receive basic medical care.\nThe National AIDS Control Council has\nestimated that there are 1.5 million people\ncurrently living with HIV and AIDS while\napproximately 68,000 people die of AIDSrelated\ncomplications annually, leaving\nbehind over 2.4 million orphans.\nIn a UNAIDS report of 2010, it was envisaged that there would be\nmany more Kenyans living with HIV, with the large majority in need\nof the more costly second-line treatment. A portion of the household\ncontribution in terms of out-of-pocket expenditure went to financing\nHIV and AIDS services. In 2001/02, the National Health Accounts\n(NHA, 2002) study demonstrated that out-of-pocket expenditure by\nhouseholds (OOP) on HIV and AIDS services was Ksh 2.61 billion (\napproximately 26.30% of total HIV spending in the country), but in\n2005/06 it was Ksh 4.24 billion (approximately 22.5%). Out-of-pocket\noutlays account for more than one-fifth of all AIDS expenditures in\nKenya. HIV infections nevertheless results in considerable expenses\nfor affected households (Source NHA, 2005/06).\nTRANSMISSION OF HIV INFECTION\nThe epidemiological analysis and modeling from the Kenya Modes of\nTransmission study (KMOT, 2008) revealed that 80% of new infections\nin Kenya occurred through heterosexual partnerships (Figure 2).\nFigure 2: Sources of new infections as captured in the KMOT (2008)\nThe KMOT (2008) also revealed the epidemic was geographically\ndiverse, influenced by prevalent cultural and behavioural practices,\nmost notably male circumcision and multiple concurrent relationships\n(Figure 3)."}
