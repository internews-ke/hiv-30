{"text": "I\u2019ll light a candle for you\n\nLATELY, SO MANY blessings have been\nhappening in my life that some things\nhave slipped my mind. I believe you all\nknow about my twin boys, these new\nbundles of absolute joy. It is largely\nbecause of them that I have not just forgotten\nwork-related issues, but that I am\nalso HIV-positive.\nIf I had my way, I would be a stay-athome\nmother and cherish these moments\nwith my children. But I have work\nto do. My \u201cIN\u201d tray is already piled to the\nceiling. And the reminders from my office\nkeep beeping on my phone.\nOne of the reminders concerned Sunday\n19 May 2013, which marked the 30th anniversary\nof the International Aids Candlelight\nMemorial, first held in Washington\nDC in 1983. The theme for this year\u2019s\nevent is \u201cIn Solidarity\u201d. It emphasises the\nneed for people living with and affected\nby HIV to join hands and work together\nfor the response to the infection.\nThe candlelight memorial reminds us\nof the impact that HIV has locally and\nglobally.\nCare and support to the rescue\nEven when I am counting my blessings,\nmy heart still goes out to many friends\nand colleagues who have passed away\ndue to HIV-related illnesses. A case in\npoint is that of Mercy, who passed away\nslightly over a month ago.\nMercy was an active member of our\nhead office support group. Diagnosed\nHIV-positive in 2002, she picked up the\npieces of her life and moved on. Her first\nhusband deserted her after she tested\nHIV-positive. She was left to care for\nthree young children, the youngest being\nnine months old.\nShe was looking for nutritional and\npsychosocial support when she visited\nour offices way back in 2005. She was\ndistraught and had lost hope for the\nfuture. Due to scarcity of food and infection\nwith tuberculosis, she had wasting\nsyndrome. This is associated with the\nlater stages of HIV infection.\nWe enrolled Mercy in our feeding programme\nand support group. This had a\nredeeming effect on her especially since\nshe had an opportunity to share experiences\nwith others who were living positively.\nGradually, she regained her health\nand weight and was able to provide for\nher family. Things were falling into place\nfor her.\nFinding life and love again\nDuring the support group sessions,\nMercy encouraged new members and\nbecame passionate in living, now that\nGod had given her a second chance. She\nfell in love with a man who respected\nher and was providing for her and her\nchildren.\nKENWA supported Mercy to come up\nwith an income-generating activity\nin 2011. We gave her seed capital\nto start a small business of selling\ncharcoal. Resilience had become her\nmiddle name by now and she was\nvibrant in her business.\nDouble whammy\nHowever, a year later, she started experiencing\npain in her left breast. Initially,\nit was a discomfort, but slowly a lump\nappeared. The breast was growing tremendously.\nMercy was referred to one district hospital\nafter another because clinicians\ncould not exactly diagnose her ailment.\nThe frequent hospital visits and medications\nalso led to financial constraints. As\nit has with other members we have given\nseed capital, this turn of events impacted\nnegatively on her business, which had\nbeen thriving. Eventually she was forced\nto close shop.\nFinally she was diagnosed with breast\ncancer at Kenyatta National Hospital. We\npaid for some medications, but unfortunately,\nthe cancer was taking an emotional\nand physical toll on her health.\nOur clients in care and treatment fare\nwell, but co-infection with HIV and\ncancer is a different ball game. Talk of a\ndouble whammy. Cancer usually hastens\nHIV progression. The situation is dire in\nour hospitals because oncologists are\nfew and facilities overstretched.\nFinal bow\nMercy finally succumbed to cancer about\na month ago. Her family was inconsolable\nduring her burial.\nI find this year\u2019s theme timely because\nit is still pertinent to draw public attention\nto HIV/Aids as well as promote a\nhumane attitude to people living with\nthe condition.\nIt is my sincere prayer that God will grant\nMercy\u2019s family the grace and fortitude to\nsoldier on. During this year\u2019s candlelight\nmemorial, I will light a candle in remembrance\nof her life, albeit belatedly.\nSHE WAS SUCH AN INSPIRATION\nMay God grant Mercy\u2019s family the grace\nand fortitude to soldier on.

This, Dr Joshua Noreh of the Nairobi\nIVF Centre says, is what we should be worried\nabout.\nThe doctor, who popularised surrogacy locally,\nsays his clinic does an average of two IVF\nprocedures for surrogate arrangements every\nmonth. Last year alone, he did about 24.\n\u201cI have made it a point to explain to my (clients)\nthe legal issues with registration, where\nthe gestational mother is the only one who can\nbe registered as the legal mother of such a baby.\nThey can then change this through an adoption\nprocess,\u201d says Dr Noreh.\nDr Joe Wanyoike Gichuhi, a fertility specialist\nand consultant at the Upper Hill medical Centre,\nsays at least one out of every 20 patients\nhe sees at his clinic requires surrogacy. He adds\nthat the procedure, if not regulated, may be\nabused by women who do not want to \u201cdamage\ntheir bodies\u201d through childbearing.\nHe also refers to a plethora of other sticky\nissues that are country-specific, like professionalism\nand ethical issues as well as regulation of\nfees charged by mushrooming health outlets.\nIndeed, the Internet is abuzz with Kenyan\nwomen, some perhaps oblivious of these issues,\nseeking clients to hire their wombs, sites like\nthe surrogatefinder.com and even job agencies\nclaiming to link surrogates with intending parents.\nIt is a thriving trade out there, it seems.\nWhile the fact that surrogacy has become\nmore popular and probably even more accepted\nis not in dispute, with six IVF centres\nnow operating in the country \u2014 four in Nairobi,\none in Eldoret, and one in Mombasa. It is the\nlegal and ethical concerns that should worry the\nconcerned authorities.\nDAILY NATION Wednesday June 5, 2013 Living 5"}
