{"text": "AWAY WITH STIGMA | Fred Gori\nTo fight HIV & Aids, recognise sex workers\nThis year\u2019s World Aids Day was\nobserved under the theme: \u201cGetting\nto zero: zero new HIV infections.\nZero discrimination. Zero Aids-related\ndeaths\u201d. The theme is a rallying call for\ngreater access to treatment for all and\nfor governments to act more decisively\nin putting in place policies that enhance\nprevention and behaviour change.\nKenya has made great progress in\ntaking the battle to HIV and Aids,\nbolstered by support from development\npartners, mainly the US Government\nBut significant hurdles remain. Notably,\nlarge gaps in treatment coverage remain\nas only 500,000 are on life-sustaining\ntreatment. And whereas prevention of\nmother-to-child prevention is now widely\navailable, many babies are still born with\nthe virus.\nWide gender gaps stick out, with\nwomen and children continuing to suffer\nthe double tragedy of debilitating poverty\nand HIV/Aids.\nStigma surrounding HIV and Aids is a\nmajor obstacle to treatment, prevention,\ncare and support. Many Kenyans view\nHIV and Aids as life-threatening and\nreact to it in strong ways. Some associate\nit with unconventional behaviour (such\nas homosexuality, drug addiction,\nprostitution or promiscuity) that are\nalready stigmatised. What is needed is an\nenvironment where no one is ashamed to\nlive with the virus.\nThe HIV prevalence in 2012 (15-49-\nyear-olds) is estimated to be 6.3 per\ncent, a considerable reduction from the\nestimated 15 per cent in 2001. However,\nthe situation gets messier among sex\nworkers, for whom the prevalence rate\nremains alarmingly high at 15-16 per cent.\nStigma and discrimination among key\npopulation segments often result in less\nopportunity to access healthcare. There\nare comparatively fewer medical facilities\nthat focus on them.\nFor the country to get rid of HIV, there\nis a need for greater emphasis on men\nwho have sex with men, intravenous drugusers,\nlong-distance truck drivers and the\nfisher-folk around Lake Victoria. Unless\nthis is done, there\u2019s a big risk that the\ngains made so far in the fight against HIV\nand Aids could be lost.\nSome non-governmental organisations\nhave been involved in empowering\nsocially disadvantaged women and girls\nto make intelligent choices for themselves\nand their families. The best example of\nsuch an organisation is the little known\nHer Story Centre led by Prof Elizabeth\nNgugi of the University of Nairobi.\nThe centre has for 20 years championed\nthe rescue of women and girls from sex\nwork and provided them with tailor-made\ntraining programmes on how to create\nand run small businesses.\nIt is now decision time. The\ngovernment, including local authorities,\nmust realise that there is no virtue\nin chasing around sex workers and\nportraying them as outcasts when an\narmy of new recruits continues to grow\neach year. As long as poverty, limited\neconomic opportunities and jobs, gender\ninequality, substance abuse and low levels\nof education remain, the sex trade will\ncontinue to thrive.\nThe best way out is to provide some\nlevel of recognition for sex workers, which\nwould allow them to operate within the\nlaw. This way, they would access regular\nhealth services including HIV testing\nand counselling. Those who are infected\nwill be put on early treatment, and more\nimportantly, will not put their clients at\nrisk of infection.\nMr Gori is a communications counsel."}
