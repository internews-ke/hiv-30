{"text": "Richard, you\u2019re a good\nfather to our children\n\nHistory. Baggage. Drama. Unresolved\nissues.\nI have realised that these are some of\nthe things that we bring into relationships\nand, by extension, parenting. They\nare like generational curses or blessings,\ndepending on how you look at them. I\nknow that my partner, Richard, has his\nown back story which we have to couple\nor clash with mine as we raise our\nchildren.\nI had a good relationship with my father.\nPsychologists say that if one\u2019s father\nwas outstanding, women look for their\nfathers in their partners. Unconsciously\nor not, I might have been looking for my\nfather in Richard.\nHowever, my father also had his tragic\nflaws. When I was growing up, he left\nme and another sibling upcountry for\nprolonged periods since he lived and\nworked in Nairobi. I felt as if we had\nbeen neglected by the person who\nclaimed to love us. We were abandoned\nand forgotten, sometimes for many\nmonths, only to be remembered when\noccasions or vacations demanded.\nThat is why I want a father for all seasons\nfor my sons. Not a seasonal father. Richard\nand I have our differences, which\nare normal to most couples, but we are\nunanimous about giving our children\nthe best upbringing that we can. This\ninvolves not just being alive and kicking,\nthrough antiretrovirals and all, but also\nbeing there through thick and thin.\nAt times, the nature of our work takes\nus miles away from each other and our\nchildren. Still, we always do our best to\nmake sure that the absences are not too\nlong.\nDearth of father figures\nI raised Peter, my firstborn son, alone. I\ndid the best I could under the circumstances.\nHowever, I know that had there\nbeen a man in the picture round the\nclock, Peter would have benefited more.\nI felt this gap on birthdays, and especially\nduring his traditional rite of passage\nseveral years ago. My emotional\nload would have been lighter. Men and\nwomen are tuned differently. As much\nas I tried to be a father, I could not fit\ninto those particular pants.\nI hope this thirst for a father figure will\nnot kill Peter\u2019s fathering instincts. He did\nnot have a live-in example or role model\nand that can be some people\u2019s undoing.\nPeter may have missed out on that\nrelationship, but I believe this can bring\nout his A-game when his parenting time\ncomes.\nOath of silence\nMy work revolves around orphans and\nvulnerable children. It does not for\none moment escape my mind that my\nchildren are truly blessed to have two\nbiological parents. Nowadays, because\nof advancement in treatment and care\nof people living with HIV, more parents\nare living to see their children and their\nchildren\u2019s children.\nIn the early days, almost always the\nfirst parent to succumb to HIV-related\ncomplications was the father. Whereas\nwomen were quick to go out of their\nway to share experiences and seek\npsychosocial and medical help, most\nmen preferred to die \u201clike soldiers\u201d. I\nam afraid to say that even today, when\nHIV has been demystified, there are men\nliving with HIV \u2014 fathers and husbands\n\u2014 who are still caught in this deathly\noath of silence.\nI met Richard because he was man\nenough to break his silence. In retrospect,\nI now see that he did not do it\njust for himself. He did it for the future.\nHe did it for our four adorable sons who\nbring us tremendous joy. And for that I\nam thankful.\nDifferent strokes for different folks\nMy sons, Joshua and Israel, have found\nout that they can walk all over me. I always\nthought I was a toughie until they\ncame along with their charm. I know\nthat when the twins, Gabriel and Baraka,\nlearn to crawl, their older brothers will\ninfect them with this walk-all-over-poormom\nvirus.\nThat is why it is good to have Richard\naround. His tough love helps put the\nboys in their place. My father handled\nthings differently. With most of his\nchildren, he did not spare the rod, even\nwhen it was not necessary. That, if not\nhandled with restraint, can be a recipe\nfor discord. I do not want our sons to\ngrow up resenting their father. Rather,\nI want them to respect him. That is\nbecause I know that Richard and I are\npassing them to other hands. They\nare not ours for keeps. And I desire, if\nthere is any hint of a (fatherhood) generational\ncurse, that it be broken in my\ngeneration.\nHappy Father\u2019s Day.\nHIS TOUGH LOVE IS GOOD FOR THE BOYS\nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother-of-five who tested HIV-positive\n23 years ago.
