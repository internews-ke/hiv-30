{"text": "\t\u2022\t\nBaby 'cured' of HIV in trial by scientists\nBy AFP\nA baby born with the virus that causes Aids appears to have been cured, scientists have announced.\nSpecialists at a major Aids meeting in Atlanta, Georgia, described the case of a child from Mississippi who is now two and a half and has been off medication for about a year with no signs of infection.\nThere is no guarantee the child will remain healthy, although sophisticated testing uncovered just traces of the virus\u2019 genetic material still lingering. If so, it would be only the world\u2019s second reported cure.\nExperts say the announcement offers promising clues for efforts to eliminate HIV infection in children, especially in Aids-plagued African countries where too many babies are born with the virus.\n\u201cYou could call this about as close to a cure, if not a cure, that we\u2019ve seen,\u201d Dr Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health said.\nA doctor gave the baby faster and stronger treatment than usual, starting a three-drug infusion within 30 hours of birth. That was before tests confirmed the infant was infected and not just at risk from a mother whose HIV was not diagnosed until she was in labour.\n\u201cI just felt like this baby was at higher-than-normal risk, and deserved our best shot,\u201d Dr Hannah Gay, a paediatric HIV specialist at the University of Mississippi, said.\nThat fast action apparently knocked out HIV in the baby\u2019s blood before it could form hideouts in the body. Those so-called reservoirs of dormant cells usually rapidly reinfect anyone who stops medication, said Dr Deborah Persaud of Johns Hopkins Children\u2019s Centre.\nShe led the investigation that deemed the child \u201cfunctionally cured\u201d, meaning in long-term remission even if all traces of the virus have not been completely eradicated.\nDr Persaud\u2019s team is now planning a study to try to prove that, with more aggressive treatment of other high-risk babies. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll be able to block this reservoir seeding,\u201d she said.\nNo one should stop anti-Aids drugs as a result of this case, Dr Fauci warned, but \u201cit opens up a lot of doors\u201d to research if other children can be helped, he said. \u201cIt makes perfect sense what happened.\u201d\nBetter than treatment is to prevent babies from being born with HIV in the first place.\nAbout 300,000 children were born with HIV in 2011, mostly in poor countries where only about 60% of infected pregnant women get treatment that can keep them from passing the virus to their babies. In the US, such births are very rare because HIV testing and treatment long have been part of prenatal care.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t promise to cure babies who are infected. We can promise to prevent the vast majority of transmissions if the moms are tested during every pregnancy,\u201d Dr Gay stressed.\nThe only other person considered cured of the Aids virus underwent a very different and risky kind of treatment \u2013 a bone marrow transplant from a special donor, one of the rare people who is naturally resistant to HIV.\nTimothy Brown of San Francisco has not needed HIV medication in the five years since that transplant.\nThe Mississippi case shows \u201cthere may be different cures for different populations of HIV-infected people,\u201d said Dr Rowena Johnston of amFAR, the Foundation for Aids Research. That group funded Dr Persaud\u2019s team to explore possible cases of paediatric cures.\nIt also suggests that scientists should look back at other children who have been treated since shortly after birth, including some reports of possible cures in the late 1990s that were dismissed at the time, said Dr Steven Deeks of the University of California, San Francisco.\n\u201cThis will likely inspire the field, make people more optimistic that this is possible,\u201d he said.\nIn the Mississippi case, the mother had had no pre-natal care when she came to a rural casualty unit in advanced labour. A rapid test detected HIV.\nIn such cases, doctors typically give the newborn low-dose medication in hopes of preventing HIV from taking root. But the small hospital did not have the proper liquid kind, and sent the infant to Dr Gay\u2019s medical centre. She gave the baby higher treatment-level doses.\nThe child responded well through 18 months, when the family temporarily stopped returning and treatment, researchers said. When they returned several months later, remarkably, Dr Gay\u2019s standard tests detected no virus in the child\u2019s blood.\nTen months after treatment stopped, a battery of super-sensitive tests at half a dozen laboratories found no sign of the virus\u2019 return. There were only some remnants of genetic material that do not appear able to replicate, Dr Persaud said.\nIn Mississippi, Dr Gay gives the child a check-up every few months: \u201cI just check for the virus and keep praying that it stays gone,\u201d she said.\nThe mother\u2019s HIV was being controlled with medication and she was \u201cquite excited for her child\u201d, Dr Gay added."}
