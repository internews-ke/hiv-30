{"text": "NOW IN A SHOP NEAR YOU: THE BARRIER METHOD OF CONTRACEPTION\nOn these six areas, the new\ngovernment gets a clean A+\nRecents hoot-tokill order solves two critical problems\nwith only one wellplaced bullet. It is an example of brilliant,\nout-of the-\nbox thinking by  our leaders and we should all support it\n\n\n\nOnce, in a supermarket in a small\ntown, I asked for condoms. After a lot of\nblushing by the cashier \u2014 and a bit of\nuhh-ming and aah-ing \u2014 she told me the\nestablishment did not stock condoms.\nReason? The proprietor of the fine place\nwas \u201csaved\u201d. She did not say from what.\nThe owner did not think she should\nbe stocking up on johnnies as they could\nencourage promiscuity. It was against her\nbeliefs, you see. She did, however, sell\ncigarettes, which I suspect bear celestial\napproval.\nIt takes a petty type of meanness\nto impose your imagined morals on\neveryone else, and it takes a special sort\nof self-restraint not to wipe your bottom\non the curtains of such high-minded\nhypocrites.\nThere is no tyranny as horrible as\nthat which pretends to know what is\ngood for you. Not stocking condoms\nin a country which has declared HIV a\nnational epidemic seems particularly\nmean-spirited.\nThis attitude just cocks the barrels\nof loathing in me. These are the\nsort of people you should have on\nanthrax mailing lists. Their fake moral\n\u201ccondomnation\u201d of sex is part of the\nreason the pandemic continues ravaging\nthe country, and I found out recently\nthat the town has one of the highest\nprevalence rates of HIV in the country.\nSex seems to be had whether you provide\ncondoms or not. Better sell them than\nnot. One large supermarket chain places\ncondoms behind glass cabinets that\nhouse alcohol. Alcohol, unlike condoms\n\u2014 which are used for the ultimate\nexpression of human affection \u2014 is a\npoison that is disgusting, contemptible,\nand risible.\nThat explains why it is ghettoised\nbehind barriers. But placing condoms\nbehind bars next to alcohol means they\ncan only be accessed at the Mututhoapproved\nhours. Or is there a message\nthat drinking should go together with the\nexpressions of a libidinous nature?\nThe method the supermarket employs\nin some of its branches puts a new spin to\nthe phrase \u201cbarrier method\u201d.\nCigarettes are far worse, destructive,\nand disgusting, than sex, yet tobacco\nis more prominently and tastefully\ndisplayed. Tobacco kills more people than\nSTIs do globally, yet Kenyans go through\nmore cigarette packs than condom\nones. And tobacco causes deaths while\ncondoms stop them.\nPutting condoms behind a glass\ncounter stigmatises them and detracts\nshoppers from buying them. And scaring\nshoppers from buying the sheaths will\nnot stop them from having sex. A teenage\ngirl would have to try hard to work up the\nconfidence to ask for them.\nPeople go to supermarkets to buy\ncondoms and not their local kiosk in order\nto escape the lecture or the leering look.\nOur Victorian prudery, merged with\nreligious self-regard, is making Aids\ncontinue its march.\nThe government, meanwhile, has\nraised taxes on condoms, imposing yet\nanother barrier in the war against STIs.\nThat should show you how serious they\nreally are about beating the HIV scourge."}
