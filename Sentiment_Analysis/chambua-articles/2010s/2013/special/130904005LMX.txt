When I met Faith 20 or so years ago, I did not know I would later need her.\nI often wondered why on earth a young\u00a0woman like her would go out of her way to keep desperate\u00a0babies in her apartment in Kayole. Was it not wise to rent it out and make money? \nI later learnt that Faith had named her children\u2019s home Imani, which is Kiswahili for her first name. How appropriate.\nAs fate would have it, I found myself caring for babies that had no one else. I did not know where to turn, especially when HIV-positive mothers\u00a0died under our care.\nI had put all attention on the recovery of the mothers and forgotten about the vulnerable children. I was still na\u00efve and never attended to even a single child\u2019s case, expecting that \u2028I would lose. \nSo it came as an emergency when I found myself with babies without caregivers. Most times I did not know where else to turn but to Faith for custody and \u2028upkeep. \nFAITH'S LABOUR OF LOVE \u2028You will not find Faith calling press conferences to express her opinion on children\u2019s predicament or the myriad challenges she faces.\nShe does her best to ensure that these children live humane lives. In essence, she is rescuing our abandoned future leaders.\nIf there are people who deserve tickets to heaven because of the selfless work they do on earth, it is Faith and her staff at Imani Children\u2019s Homes.\nShe has a big, big\u00a0accommodating heart. These folks are nurturing over 3,000 children ranging from days old to some at university. \nThere is another side to Faith that I admire. As opposed to KENWA (read me), she takes in any needy baby. Personally, to take or consider a child\u2019s case, \nHIV must be mentioned somewhere to justify it. It is either HIV or the highway.\nTo us, the child qualifies to be needy if both parents are dead and relatives are MIA. Even under such circumstances, we demand a letter from the local chief if we cannot get a death certificate indicating immune suppression\u2026 or such terms that \u201cbaptise\u201d Aids-related deaths.\nWALK OF FAITH \nWhen I recently visited Faith in Kayole, she told me\u00a0she is organising a walk from Nairobi to Malindi to raise funds to build a nyumba ya wazee.\nHer workers are old and have nowhere to go. She wanted me to support her in whatever way I could. \n\u201cFaith, I can\u2019t even attempt to walk from Kayole to Embakasi,\u201d I sighed. \n\u201cNo,\u201d she went ahead with her usual smile, as if indicating that I cannot walk even three metres to save my life. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to walk; I just want you \u2028to flag it off.\u201d\nFaith has scheduled it for 1 December, which is World Aids Day (WAD). I asked her why she had settled on, of all days, WAD.\n\u201cNo one ever told me 1 December is, er, WAD,\u201d she countered. \nFaith is not pretentious. She has no time to catch up with the same old same old \u201crecurrent\u201d affairs. Her world consists of babies from all walks of life.\n\u201cAsunta, please tell your friends about this walk so that they can join us.\u201d \nMe? I do not want to merely tell you about Faith\u2019s walk.\nUNSUNG HEROINE\nI want to toot the horn of this unsung heroine who has committed her life to rescuing our needy children.\nShe has sacrificed\u00a0wifely and biological mother ambitions and in return has become the mother of multitudes. Faith once told me that she cannot \u2028even keep a relationship. \n\u201cWhich brother will date a sister with over 3,000 children all calling her Mom? When will she even have time for him?\u201d\nSpeaking of time, Faith\u2019s daily focus is how to get food, (formula) milk, clothes, firewood, and getting her sick children to hospital. As if that is not enough, she is always being called to take in more abandoned babies. At times she gets children who really need special care.\nRecently Faith got a baby with no genital organs. They had to do a quick surgery to allow passage of stool and urine. More surgery is scheduled for the limbless and genderless angel.\nAfter delivery, the baby\u2019s mother walked away. She refused to have anything to do with the malformed baby. Faith says the baby is her favourite.\nDo not ask me why.\nI appreciate and celebrate this woman. I do not know how those who select our national heroes pass over Faith. \nIf you are reading this, kindly support this unsung hero in her walk and work. \nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother-of-five who tested HIV-positive 26 years ago.
