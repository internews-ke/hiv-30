{"text": "Disclose HIV status\nIf we lived in a perfect world, disclosing our\nHIV status would come naturally. Indeed, in\nthis day and age, it is ridiculous for people,\nsome of them prominent and wealthy, to live in\ndenial because of the stigma associated with the\nAids virus, thereby endangering the lives of their\nspouses and other associates.\nNow the National Aids Control Council is on\na charm offensive, trying to persuade prominent\npersonalities living with the virus to come out in\nthe open and admit it, with the aim of assuring\nKenyans that Aids ceased to be a death sentence\nmany years ago.\nThis, of cause, is a tall order. Such people would\nrather use antiretroviral drugs in secret and pretend\nthat everything is all right. Unfortunately, they\nare the same ones who would refuse to use any\nprotection, thus infecting others.\nSuch outcomes are to be highly regretted. It\ntakes an exceptionally brave person to admit living\nwith HIV, and though there may be other causes\nbesides sexual promiscuity, their fears are real.\nToo many Kenyans are still dying, most through\npreventable ignorance. Losing 49,126 Kenyans\nfrom opportunistic diseases in one year should not\nbe countenanced."}
