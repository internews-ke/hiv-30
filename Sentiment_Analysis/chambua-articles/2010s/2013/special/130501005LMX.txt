{"text": "PLEASE DON\u2019T CALL YOURSELF A SUFFERER\nIt\u2019s wrong to use your HIV status to get freebies\nDepending on donor aid, our organisation gives food and other forms of support  to people living with HIV\nwho are in dire straits. This is an effort to help them regain their footing. Also, depending on the availability of funds, we give them seed money to start income-generating activities.\nWe realised that many of our members, most of whom are women, become sole breadwinners due to a\nnumber of reasons. Some because their husbands become bedridden and cannot provide, or their spouses lose their jobs due to HIV-related complications, or they are widows and grandmothers caring for orphans and vulnerable children.\nWhat is worse, some of these women have to endure the trauma of their in-laws taking all their property after their husbands die.\nDesperation\nThis required urgent attention because our members were becoming destitute and desperate by the day.\nSomeone once said that the road to hell is paved with good intentions. With time and experience, we found that our good intention was, in some cases, creating a dependency of sorts and turning us into enablers.\nWhen I tested HIV-positive,\nI could have done with some seed money. There were no employers out there \u2014 at least I never came across any\n\u2014 who were prepared to give a job to an HIV-positive single mother. We had to be creative\nand, like Hannibal said, \u201cFind a way or make a way.\u201d\nWatching my friend Joe\nMuriuki, who is one of the longest HIV survivors I know,\nand others being sworn in as\nmembers of the HIV/Aids Tribunal\nthe other day brought\nback sad memories of yesteryears.\nIn the dark old days, there\nwas what you could call institutionalised\nstigma. It was as\nif PLWHs were deemed to be\nunfit for anything save stigma\nand discrimination.\nPositive change\nAnd the fact that I can now\nbe called for a job, locally and\ninternationally, because of my\nHIV status just goes to show\nthat things can change. But\nthis can only happen if we do\nour part.\n\u201cIt\u2019s up to you now,\u201d I always\ntell the members that we\ngive seed money to, \u201cbecause\nwe can only support you to a\ncertain extent.\u201d\nTrust me, teaching folks\nwho were used to fish handouts\nhow to fish is one tough\nassignment. I believe that one\nof the things that is robbing\nsome PLWHs of their financial\nindependence is Aids. Nope,\nnot that Aids.\nI am talking about Acquired\nImmune Dependency Syndrome.\nThere are some who\nsee their HIV sero-positive\nstatus as a meal ticket. They\nrefuse to work and instead let\nthe virus work for them.\nOur community health\nworkers (CHWs) used to tell\nme of some PLWHs who were\nmembers of several HIV service\norganisations.\n\u201cThey are card-carrying\nmembers of all these NGOs\nand they know the days when\neach organisation gives food\nand will be there on time,\nevery time.\u201d\nIndividuals like these give\nPLWHs a bad name. I have,\nmultiple times, had to caution\nour CHWs to guard against\ngiving seed money to the\nsame members. There is only\nso much that we can do for\none person.\nWhat disheartened me\nwas hearing reports from our\nnurses about people who\nwere, literally, asking for it.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had cases of some\npeople who are HIV-negative\nbegging us to say they are\nHIV-positive just so they can\nbe put in our food support\nprogramme.\u201d\n\u201cThese people don\u2019t know\nwhat they\u2019re asking for,\u201d I\nsaid.\nWe have a choice\nI am a firm believer that\nwork is ordained by God and\nthat it is a blessing. There are\ndays that I drag myself to the\noffice, even when I am feeling\nunwell, because I know that\nmy line of work deals with\nhuman beings. It touches on\nmatters of life and death.\nYears ago, the HIV community\nfought against being\ncalled victims or sufferers. We\nreasoned that those monikers\ndemeaned us and made\nus look like we did not have\na choice. That is why it saddens\nme to hear some of our\npeople who are able-bodied\ncalling themselves sufferers.\nThrough saying and doing,\nI am trying to teach my children\nthat work is honourable\nand rewarding. I know there\nis a sub-culture in our country\nof folks waiting for things to\nhappen. Sufferers, if you may.\nGuys who wait for the government\nto do. Or, tragically,\nsome lying that they are HIVpositive\nso they can be given\nthings without sweating.\nToday being Labour Day, it\nhas just occurred to me that\nsince I started my HIV work,\nI have never gone on annual\nleave."}
