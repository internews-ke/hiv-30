{"text": "MY BIO IS A GREAT WEIGHT OFF MY SHOULDERS\nTracing my path from\nheartbreak to daybreak\nI CAN REPORT ONE ACCOMPLISHMENT IN THIS NEW YEAR: the book I\u2019ve been\npromising is finally out. My biography is mostly about my personal journey from\nchildhood to when I found out I was HIV-infected.\nI vowed to have this book out after I was involved in a car accident. Were it not\nfor God\u2019s grace, I would be a goner and my memory faded from most people. Isn\u2019t\nthat what happens after most burials? As they say, life goes on.\nAfter the accident, I realised I was taking too much for granted. I refocused on\naccomplishing the items on my to-do lists, which stretched for as long as I could\nremember: one of them was penning my bio.\nThe other side of Asunta\nI had another reason to have this book out. People associate me with Aids. Most\ntimes, my name is mentioned in the same breath with the word \u201cAids\u201d. I want to let\npeople know \u2013 more so my kids \u2013 that Aids just gatecrashed later in life. I want them\nto know that their mother was born like other children and brought up in the village.\nI actually had a \u201cnormal\u201d childhood.\nI want folks to know the other side of Asunta. That I was your typical adolescent.\nNever mind that this is where things started happening. I had attended very strict\nschools and didn\u2019t know what to do with all the freedom in college.\nIn the city, nobody cared what I did or didn\u2019t do outside class. And there was peer\npressure. I wanted to fit in the \u201ccollege girl class\u201d, which dictated that I drop my\ncountry bumpkin mentality and adapt to certain lifestyles.\nSex and life education\nI can\u2019t say I wasn\u2019t cautioned by my parents; they always told me to be careful\nwith men, that men are \u201cnot good\u201d. But they failed to tell me that my George \u2013 the\nboyfriend who infected me \u2013 would approach me differently. I felt lost.\nFor the first time, someone told me I was beautiful. I didn\u2019t care whether this was\ntrue or not; I just wanted to hear it over and over again. George appreciated me; all I\nhad known before were reprimands and criticism. Before long, he was saying how he\nlonged for me to complete college so we could settle down. He talked about a good\nhouse and having as many children as we could support: that was music to my ears.\nWith all these promises, everything inside me melted. I forgot about my parents\u2019\ncaution. Obviously, I thought, they had not referred to this kind man.\nGeorge was a good man. He was different. For starters, he didn\u2019t look sick. He\nwas handsome and had a car and money. He had everything a woman would want\nin a man. The only hitch \u2013 which I can came to know about after the horse had\nbolted \u2013 was that he was HIV-positive.\nThis far God has brought me\nIn the book, I have detailed my post-traumatic experience. I want to clarify here\nthat I have no hard feelings against anyone; I\u2019ve forgiven and moved on. But I have\nto be truthful because that\u2019s the meaning of this whole thing.\nWhat I didn\u2019t tell the publisher was that when I was given the final copy to proofread\nand approve, I broke down and cried many times. I cried because I realised\nhow far I\u2019ve come, in fact, how far God has brought me. I\u2019m human, and there were\ntimes I took offence and wanted to confront some people and ask them why they\nmistreated me this way. Why they mistreated Peter when I was on my deathbed\nand weighing about 35 kilogrammes. Why?\nI felt like I wanted to turn back the hands of time and get to the bottom of some\nissues. Then I realised that, at times, it\u2019s easy to drown when the only thing you\u2019re\ntrying to do is get to the bottom of things. So I let bygones be bygones.\nThis book is another achievement. I feel at peace that finally this weight is off my\nchest. I appreciate those who have been pushing and asking me when the book will\nbe out. I share with you the pride and the joy.\nThe book is titled From Heartbreak to Daybreak and is now on sale.\nMY BIO IS A GREAT WEIGHT OFF MY SHOULDERS\nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother-of-three who tested HIV-positive\n23 years ago. She is the executive director of the Kenya Network of Women\nwith Aids (KENWA). Email: asuntawagura@hotmail.com"}
