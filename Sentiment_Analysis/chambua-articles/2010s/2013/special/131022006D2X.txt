{"text": "Being HIV-positive puts you A compromised immune\nsystem increases one\u2019s\nvulnerability to certain\ncancers, the most one\ncommon being caused\nby the Kaposi sarcoma\nherpes virus\n\nBY DR TOROOTI MWIRIGI\nnation@askadoc.co.ke People with HIV are highly\nvulnerable to various health\nconditions, which are often\nlife-threatening, due to their\nseverely weakened immune system.\nSuch people are at great risk of\ndeveloping some types of cancers as\npart of the Aids-defining conditions.\nThis means that if a person with HIV\ndevelops one of these cancers, there is\na possibility that he/she could develop\nfull-blown Aids. The association\nbetween these cancers and HIV/Aids\npossibly depends on the person\u2019s\nweakened immune system.\nIn addition, people who are infected\nwith a type of virus known as the\nKaposi sarcoma herpes virus and\nare HIV-positive are at a greater\nrisk of developing Kaposi sarcoma\ncancer. These cancers usually begin\nwhen a person\u2019s normal cells start\nto change, and eventually grow\nuncontrollably, thus forming a\nmass known as a tumor. A tumor\ncan be either benign, meaning it is\nnon-cancerous, or malignant, which\nmeans it is cancerous and can spread\nto other parts of the body. The most\ncommon cancer associated with\nHIV/Aids is Kaposi sarcoma. Others\nmay include cancers of the cervix,\nmouth, lungs, Hodgkin\u2019s disease\nand non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nKaposi Sarcoma (KS)\nThis is a type of skin cancer that\ncauses patches of abnormal tissue\nto grow on the skin, in the lining of\nthe throat, nose and mouth or other\norgans. It is caused by the herpes\nvirus known as Human Herpes Virus\n8 (HHV-8), and affects more men\nthan women.The difference between\nKaposi sarcoma and other cancers is\nthat, whereas most cancers start in\none area and then spread, the lesions\nin Kaposi sarcoma can start in more\nthan one area of the body at the same\ntime. Even in cases where only one\nskin lesion is visible, most people will\nhave already developed lesions that\nare too small to be noticed in other\nareas of the body. The patches are\nred or purple and are made of blood\ncells and cancer cells. These red or\npurple patches often do not have any\nsymptoms but may be painful. If the\ncancer spreads to the lungs or the\ndigestive system, bleeding can result.\nA person can experience difficulty in\nbreathing if he or she has lung tumors.\nLesions that appear in the groin area\nand legs may cause painful swellings\non the feet and legs.\nTypes of Kaposi sarcoma\nThe types of Kaposi sarcoma are\ndefined by the different populations\nin which they develop. However, the\nchanges within the Kaposi sarcoma\ncells are same.\nEpidemic or AIDS-related\nThis is the most common type of\nKS and it develops in people who\nare HIV positive. The HIV virus\ndamages the immune system, making\na person vulnerable to infections\nand complications such as Kaposi\nsarcoma.\nClassic or Mediterranean\nThis type is more common in older\npeople and affects more women than\nmen. The lesions in this type of Kaposi\nsarcoma do not grow fast and new\nlesions take time to develop. The\nimmune system in this case is not\nas weak as that of epidemic KS, but\nold age naturally weakens it.\nEndemic or African\nIt is common in Africa and affects\npeople under 40 years. On very\nrare occasions, an aggressive type\nof Kaposi sarcoma may occur in\nchildren before they reach puberty.\nIt progresses very fast and usually\naffects the lymph nodes and other\nbody organs.\nIatrogenic or transplant-related Kaposi\nsarcoma\nThis type occurs as a result of a\nsuppressed immune system after an\norgan transplant. The drugs used to\navoid rejection of the new organ by the\nimmune system weaken it, so a person\nwith the Kaposi sarcoma herpes virus\ndevelops the disease.\nSymptoms\nThe most noticeable signs of Kaposi\nsarcoma are the lesions that appear\non the skin that might not be lifethreatening.\nThese lesions have the\nfollowing characteristics;\nThey are flat, painless, non-itchy\nand do not drain.\nThey appear as purple or red spots\nBeing HIV-positive puts you A compromised immune\nsystem increases one\u2019s\nvulnerability to certain\ncancers, the most one\ncommon being caused\nby the Kaposi sarcoma\nherpes virus\nNutrition For Cancer Patients\nA person with cancer requires a\ndiet that provides the body with\nall the key nutrients necessary for\nstrengthening the immune system.\nThis might require consuming\ntwice the number of calories than\nusual to help maintain normal\nbody weight.\nIt is recommended that cancer\npatients get weighed daily to\ndetermine whether they are\nconsuming enough calories. Due\nto decreased appetite, the patient\nshould take regular meals in small\nquantities.\nThrush and mouth sores might\nmake eating uncomfortable, so it\nis advisable to give bland food is\nadvisable to avoid this.\nTips on increasing calorie intake:\nDrink whole milk rather than\nlow-fat milk\nAdd cheese to your sandwiches,\neggs and vegetables\nIncrease your daily intake of\nsnacks to two to three times a day\nEat fatty fish like salmon two or\nthree times in a week\nAdd sugar, honey, milk, oil and\nmargarine to your meals\nSnack on hard-boiled eggs, nuts,\ncheese and hard candies\nSpread margarine and peanut\nbutter on toast and waffles\nAdd slices of avocado to your\nsalad or sandwich\nThe overall health of the patient\ncan be improved by giving the\npatient the support required as\nwell as taking every precaution\nat home. This can be done by\nensuring that the the patient\ntakes their medication exactly\nas prescribed and also being\naware of the possible side effects.\nAlso, have painkillers such as\nAcetaminophen and Ibuprofen\nat home. Learn more about the\ncondition and how to manage the\nsymptoms. It is also advisable that\nthe patient join a support group\nto share his or her experience with\nothers suffering from the disease.\nOrganisations such as the Africa\nCancer Association help cancer\npatients cope with the disease."}
