{"text": "The 3rd National HIV Prevention Summit: 17th-18th Sept. 2013\nNATIONAL AIDS CONTROL COUNCIL\nTheme: \u201cHIV Prevention: Every one\u2019s Business\u201d.\nOFFICE OF THE PRIME MINISTER\nMINISTRY OF STATE FOR PUBLIC SERVICE\nGlobal Fund Reaching Vulnerable Communities\nand Most-at-risk Population\nHIV prevalence rate in\nKenya today stands at\n5.6% from a high of 14%\nin the 1990\u2019s at the peak\nof the epidemic. This is\nno mean achievement\nby any standards. It took\na resolve by the country\non realizing that the\nscourge had reached a\ndisaster crescent and\nhence posed a developmental\nchallenge to realize\nthis achievement.\nIt is this National resolve\nthat has enabled the\ncountry to stabilize the\nepidemic at the current\nlevel. HIV is no longer a\ndeath sentence as individuals\nliving with the virus\ncan leave normal and fulfilling\nlives.\nBoth short and long-term programmatic interventions have been\nput in place to counter the pandemic with encouraging results.\nToday children are being born HIV free by infected mothers while\nkeeping the mothers alive. HIV Tribunal, one of its kind in the\nworld is in place to address grievances arising as a result of individuals\nHIV status. This has helped a lot in addressing issues\nrelated to stigma and discrimination.\nKenya is among the regional leaders in the HIV and AIDS Programming\ntaking bold steps to initiate interventions that have\nbeen proven to not only be effective but also efficient thereby\nmaking it a ground for learning lessons by its peers in the region.\nIn collaboration with regional and global partners, Kenya has conducted\ncutting-edge HIV research that has led to ground breaking\nbiomedical prevention findings. Kenya scientists led trials that\nestablished the efficacy of voluntary male medical circumcision,\npre-exposure prophylaxis and treatment as prevention.\nThe AIDS response in Kenya is multi-sectoral based, coordinated\nby the National AIDS Control Council and implemented through\nperiodic strategic plans. The KNASP III is just coming to an end\nand the KNASP IV will be in place by July 2014. As the process\nof developing the same is in top gear, the Prevention Revolution\nRoadmap that has formed part of this Summit will heavily inform\nthe development of the next Kenya National AIDS Strategic Plan\nfour.\nThe summit provides an opportunity to reflect back on where we\nare coming from to inform the intended re-orientation of our interventions.\nWe finally have a chance to sample the programme\ninterventions that have worked to improve and re-engineer and\nthose that haven\u2019t produced results to be discarded. We believe\nthe summit will culminate into a clear roadmap that will lead the\ncountry to the Vision of an HIV Free Society.\nNational resolve\nstabilizes epidemic\nMessage from the NACC Director\nProf. Alloys S.
