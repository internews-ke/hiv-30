{"text": "Consider family values\nin advertising condom\n\nKenya declared HIV/AIDS a national\ndisaster in 1999. Since then,\nwe have witnessed an upsurge in\nbehaviour change campaigns to prevent\nthe disease from causing future\ndestruction on the economy.\nMost campaigns have given limited\nattention to contextual and\nstructural barriers that prevent\ncommunities from accessing HIV\ninformation and services, such as\nreligious beliefs.\nI want to reflect on the ongoing\ndiscussion on the advertisement\nWeka Condom Mpangoni. The fact\nstill remain that married couples\nare becoming more at risk because\nof infidelity and mistrust (NASCOP\nreports on HIV 2011).\nNANDOYA S. ERICK, Siaya\nKudos to the National Aids Control\nCouncil for calling a spade a\nspade not a big spoon. Truth should\nset us free; our morals have decayed\nand the earlier we admit it the better.\nA sick person must accept he or\nshe is sick for the doctor to prescribe\nany medication. Listening to the\nBreakfast Show on Classic 105 with\nMaina Kageni, it is clear mipangos\nare there, and married couples are\ncheating on each other. Sad truth is,\nless than a quarter use condoms.\nThe Church should stop their hypocrisy.\nSome of the church leaders\nare also part of the problem. Accepting\nour weakness is vital for our cure\nso as to save future generations from\nthis AIDS monster.\nSince Kenyans cannot do without\nextra-marital affairs NACC is simply\nasking them to at least protecting\nthemselves while at it.\nAUSTIN ADRIANS, Nairobi"}
