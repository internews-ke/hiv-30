{"text": "JOSHUA DOESN\u2019T LIKE GIRLS WHO TALK TOO LOUDLY\nIs it too early to give my son \u2018the talk\u2019?\n\nLATE LAST YEAR, Joshua turned six. We celebrated his birthday because, like all my children, his life has given me tonnes of life. When I look at my three little ones, I \u201ceyeball\u201d HIV and go, \u201cThree strikes, you\u2019re out!\u201d\nSomeone asked why I give my children Biblical names. I have good reasons: I believe in a supreme being. I have no doubt that I\u2019ve come this far because of God\u2019s doing, not mine.\nWere it not for God shining the lights called Peter, Joshua and Issa into my dark existence, I\u2019m sure I\u2019d still be groping around a bleak endless tunnel. I\u2019m not a perfect\nChristian, but the Bible remains my reference point. Even Joshua\u2019s christening was drawn from this spiritual belief; that names speak volumes.\nAfter accepting being HIV-positive, I endeavoured to live a constructive life. Joshua\u2019s birth was the icing on my living positively cake. In fact, his name symbolised myconquering the barriers that had been placed in my path because of my HIV status.\nJoshua was a new page, personal and public, in the fight against HIV. Although\nhe was not the first to be born HIV-free from a HIV-positive mother, I proudly report\nhe was the first to be declared publicly as having escaped HIV despite being born to\nHIV-positive parents, so he symbolised hope among those who are HIV-infected.\nMany HIV-positive couples got children after I shared my conception experience.\nHow many tested negative/positive is a story for another Wednesday.\nThe 411 on Joshua\nLately, Joshua has been coming to the house with both boys and girls of his age.\nHe introduces them as his friends. But not so long ago he came with a girl called\nMira, whom he was quick to introduce to me as his girlfriend.\nSeeing my consternation, he explained that this particular girl was his girlfriend\nand he even showed her where to sit, before getting her snacks from the kitchen.\nJoshua doesn\u2019t do this for his other \u201cgeneral\u201d friends.\nAbout month later, he brought another girl called Rosa, introduced her as his girlfriend,\nand told me he had broken up with Mira.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cBecause she sucks.\u201d\nI know this expression means something unpleasant, and I didn\u2019t expect Joshua\nto use it to refer to a friend. Besides, I thought he was too young to use such words.\nI let them have their computer games and later he escorted her out.\n\u201cWhy did you break up with Mira?\u201d I asked Joshua after he returned.\n\u201cBecause she sucks,\u201d he replied.\n\u201cWhat exactly do you mean by \u2018she sucks\u2019?\u201d\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know computer games and she won\u2019t listen to me when I teach her.\u201d\nWhat he looks for\n\u201cIs that all?\u201d I persisted.\n\u201cAlso, when I tell her to talk slowly because \u2018my baby\u2019 is sleeping, she won\u2019t listen\nand continues speaking loudly ... And when she does something wrong, she laughs\ninstead of saying sorry. One more thing; she cries a lot even over small things.\u201d\n(FYI: Joshua refers to Issa, his baby brother, as \u2018my baby\u2019. My efforts to correct\nthis have fallen on deaf ears.)\n\u201cSo what\u2019s good about the new girlfriend?\u201d\n\u201cMum, Rosa is cool! Also, she knows a lot of stuff and listens when I\u2019m talking.\u201d\nThis is a topic he didn\u2019t want me to dwell on. Plus, he warned me that his father\nand elder brother, Peter, should not know.\nI hope Joshua will forgive me for exposing his \u201cconquering\u201d of members of the\nopposite sex. I\u2019m still lost for words though. I thought he was too young to think\nalong such lines. I\u2019m now preparing to discuss with him how these girls qualified\nfrom friends to girlfriends.\nIt\u2019s my turn to start introducing a sentence or two regarding issues of sexuality\nand HIV. Or is it too early?\nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother-of-three who tested HIV-positive\n23 years ago. She is the executive director of the Kenya Network"}
