{"text": "HOW TO OVERCOME THE CHALLENGES OF\nLIVING WITH HIV\n\nSpinoza Ochieng: \n\nThanks for touching on HIV/ Aids. Kenya today has a staggering 1.6 million\npeople living with the disease, and a further 1.2\nmillion orphans. Some of these people are the sole\nbread winners in their families, they live positively because a free flow of ARVs is guaranteed, and it\u2019s like food to them that must be taken daily.\nKaranja, Utawala: Good lesson for those infected and all of us affected in one way or another.\nKianduma Dominic: Aids patients are our brothers and sisters. To isolate them is like cursing oneself.\nEmpower them by loving them and bringing them closer to yourself.\nFredrick Makau: Decline of stigma marks the roadmap to the discovery of the pandemic\u2019s cure.\nEdmond Oduor: Does it mean that HIV has more brains than humans? It doesn\u2019t discriminate; it cuts across the divide, not gender, race, tribe, age, class, political inclination or region. Why don\u2019t we learn from this?"}
