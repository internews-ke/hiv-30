This HIV-\n1, the Nature journal reported,\nmutates frequently, making it\ndifficult to create vaccines that\nrecognise the mutants.\nBut the researchers would\nhave to work more on the subject\nto understand what makes the\nantibodies to evolve because this\nwould be key in eliciting similar\nbehaviour in other patients.\nIn fact, the type of antibody\nthese scientists studied is less\ncomplicated and recognises\nfewer viruses than some other\nbroadly neutralising antibodies,\nsuch as those in a class\ncalled VRC01. The researchers\ncompared the sample from the\npatient with what they had in\nstock, looking for similar antibodies\nand the viral copies to\ndetermine its evolution path.\nRapport"}
