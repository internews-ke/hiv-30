{"text": "LIFE IS FULL OF MYSTERIES AND SURPRISES\nLooking good can be\nseen as a bad thing\nOccasion: World Aids Day (WAD), last year. Place: Nakuru. I\u2019m all set for the\nlaunch of my biography by Vice President Kalonzo Musyoka.\nIt\u2019s not every day that prominent people launch the biographies of people living\nwith HIV so I feel extremely honoured. You can imagine the butterflies in my stomach\nwhen by noon the guest of honour hasn\u2019t arrived.\nIt\u2019s at this time that I see someone I think I know walking towards me. I can\u2019t exactly\ntell where I\u2019ve seen him before. This is the current situation with my memory; I\njust can\u2019t seem to recall where I saw someone. And let\u2019s not even talk about remembering\nnames...\nThe man introduces himself as Alex and extends a frail hand. My prognosis is he\u2019s\npositive: HIV stage four is my \u201ceducated\u201d guess.\n\u201cI learnt that you were coming to Nakuru for the WAD and vowed I\u2019d come to see\nyou so you\u2019d help me,\u201d he sighs.\nHelp him? This guy has just alighted from one of those fuel-guzzlers you\u2019d want\nyour maths teacher to see you driving because of the many times he remarked that\nyou\u2019d amount to nothing.\n\u201cI\u2019m not promising miracles, but I\u2019ll help where I possibly can,\u201d I tell him, which is\nmy standard answer to folks so they don\u2019t have unrealistic explanations.\n\u201cYou mean you can\u2019t remember me?\u201d he asks.\nThen he reminds me. I can\u2019t believe it: here\u2019s the\nbig shot who once cancelled my contract for the\nstrangest reason I\u2019ve ever heard.\nMemory Lane\nIt was back in 90\u2019s. I had just started HIV\nwork and gone public about my status.\nAlex was the director of an organisation\nthat had HIV workshops all over the\ncountry and they wanted me to work\nwith them.\nI had to facilitate about 20 workshops.\nDuring the second one,\nAlex and senior management\nwere present and\ntheir comments were positive:\n\u201cIt\u2019s great.\u201d \u201cIt will really\nimpact on people\u2019s attitude.\u201d \u201cIt will contribute to\nbehaviour change.\u201d\nThe professional fee I was to get was, to me,\nwas like hitting the jackpot.\n\u201cOnce I get paid, I\u2019ll move from my 11-by-10\nroom in Kayole, and get a double room,\u201d I swore.\n\u201cMy landlady\u2019s a monster, always there at the\nstroke of month-end. \u201cShe\u2019s always going on\nabout how she\u2019s doing me a favour because I have\nso many people crowded in one room. For the\nfirst time I\u2019ll pay rent in advance.\u201d\nI also planned to buy a sideboard with a cabinet\nfor a TV set. The telly I planned to buy wasn\u2019t a flat screen, but a Greatwall. Plus, I\nwas going to buy several metres of a plastic flowery carpet.\n\u201cUn-counting\u201d my chicks\nOn the morning I was to travel to Naivasha for the next workshop, I was asked to\nsee the director first.\nAs soon as I stepped into his office, Alex, without looking up, told me he had cancelled\nmy contract. Reason? According to him I didn\u2019t look like I was HIV infected. I\nlooked too good. Too healthy. Too beautiful.\nWhen you\u2019re infected with HIV, there are many insults that can be hurled your\nway. But I never expected my rights to be denied because I looked too good to be\nHIV-positive. HIV really has mysteries and surprises.\nI was broken-hearted as I boarded a matatu home to the room I had planned to\nexpand. I cried the whole night, hiding from my siblings and my son, Peter. I consoled\nmyself that I shouldn\u2019t stare too long at the shut door because I could miss the\nnext opened door.\nIn no time, I forgot about this. But I wished in my heart that this man could understand\nwhat one goes through when they\u2019re HIV-infected, because if he did he would\nnot have denied me the job I so badly needed.\nBack to Nakuru, last year.\n\u201cAsunta, I tested HIV-positive. Despite following my doctor\u2019s orders, my health\nhas taken a turn for the worst and that\u2019s why I wanted to see you.\u201d\nI don\u2019t tell Alex how I hated him when he cancelled my contract. I feel sorry for\nhim and feel like my cries and bitter prayers to God that day may have caused this\nrepercussion. Maybe I should not have been that bitter; after all, it was his money.\nWe agree he\u2019ll come to see me in Nairobi, although, honestly, I don\u2019t have definite\nanswers.\nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother-of-three who tested HIV-positive\n23 years ago.
