{"text": "This mortuary visit saved many lives\n\nRECENTLY, I visited informal settlements\nthat KENWA has centres in\nto catch up with what\u2019s happening in\nour programs. In all our operational\nNairobi informal settlements, there are\nno bedridden clients. These days all\nour members are busy running income\ngenerating activities. In fact, they are\nasking for more loans to boost their\nbusinesses.\nIt wasn\u2019t always like this. Years ago,\nI visited Korogocho where we have\na drop-in centre. This was during the\ntime when we were initiating antiretroviral\ndrugs support for our members.\nWhen I concluded the tour, a certain\nwoman approached me.\n\u201cMy baby is dead, but I can\u2019t taker\nher to the mortuary because I have\nbeen told to provide fuel to ferry the\nbody.\u201d\nThe other group members said they\nrefused to help her because she used\nto lock the sick baby inside the house\nand go for \u201croad\u201d, leaving poor baby\nAsha without a caretaker and food. So\nthey concluded that it was good Asha\nhad died the way she (the mother) had\nwanted. \u201cRoad\u201d is the street name for\ncommercial sex work.\nI drove the weeping mother to the\nauthorities to get a permit to take the\nbody to the mortuary. There were no\nmore issues as I would carry the body\nin my car.\nDrama at the morgue\nThe drama started at the mortuary.\nIt\u2019s KENWA\u2019s policy never to bribe for\nservices. The mortuary attendant, on\nseeing it was a KENWA car, quickly\ntold me, \u201cNyinyi KENWA si mnajibebeanga\nmwili msinipe chai? He was\naccusing us of never bribing him, because\nwe always carry \u201cour\u201d dead.\n\u201cCome I\u2019ll show you where to place\nthe body,\u201d he continued.\nThe mother was still weeping inside\nmy car, next to her dead baby\u2019s body.\nThe prudent thing to do was for me\nto pick the body alone and follow\nthe mortuary attendant, leaving the\nmother in the car.\nI picked the small body - actually\nthere was nothing much to pick as it\nwas just a small skeleton wrapped in\nhuman skin - and I followed the attendant\nto the hall. I passed several bodies.\nI think this person was punishing me or\nKENWA for refusing with chai. I placed\nthe baby on the appointed trolley next\nto another body, and then covered\nAsha with the baby shawl she had\nbeen wrapped in.\nIn a no-nonsense manner, the attendant\ntold me to remove the shawl,\nsaying the baby didn\u2019t need it. I removed\nit, leaving the thin, rather exaggerated\nlong and stretched body.\n\u201cUndress the body,\u201d the attendant\nordered, which I obediently did. The attendant\nwas still unrelenting.\n\u201cMama, so that\u2019s why you\u2019re covering\nthe body? You have not been feeding\nthe baby, so you come here to cover\nthe body with a shawl to avoid embarrassment.\nYou should be ashamed you\nkilled this baby with starvation.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t explain that the baby was not\nmine, there was no point in dishing the\nmother more agony and misery.\nI was ordered to tag the body, which\nI did. As I exited the mortuary I vowed\none thing: something will have to be\ndone to stop these \u201cavoidable deaths\u201d.\nCracking the care whip\nIn the next community workers\nmeeting, we cracked the whip. We\nindicated that for you to remain in\nKENWA\u2019s payroll, you must not lose\nthree patients in two months, if you\ndid, you would be disqualified from\nwork. This strategy worked.\nSick patients being taken care of at\nhome were now taken to hospital when\nthey required institutionalised care.\nSince nobody wanted to be disqualified,\nwithin a short time clients were\nreferred for antiretroviral therapy and\ndeaths reduced drastically. Nowadays\nwe go for months without a reported\ndeath.\nThe mortuary attendant was somehow\nright. I needed to be ashamed\nthat Asha had died out of neglect.\nIn a way, he made us work smarter,\nand thereby \u201cdeny\u201d him, not only chai,\nbut work.\nWE NOW WORK SMARTER\nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother-of-three who tested HIV-positive\n25 years ago.
