{"text": "November 7,\u00a02012\nI have taken many mercies for granted\nBy ASUNTA WAGURA\nIt\u2019s Friday. Tomorrow I\u2019ll receive an award from the Voice of Hope organisation. As we rehearse, I look at my fellow awardees and wonder what they were nominated for. \nMy train of thought is interrupted by a melody. In the four days I\u2019ve been here, I\u2019ve learnt that the melody goes off after every hour. When this happens, everyone must observe a moment of silence. \nMeaning you press the \u201cpause button\u201d on what you\u2019re doing (or thinking) and simply reflect on your inner self. I think it\u2019s called meditation. \nAs the place sinks into a deep silence, I don\u2019t reflect on myself. I\u2019m thinking about what everyone else thinking. Are their thoughts wandering too? \nThe minute is over and the melody is gone. Well, at times it\u2019s spiritually beneficial to reflect on the self.\nIt\u2019s raining heavily. We\u2019ve been told that people can take silent walks to meditate. I\u2019m very cautious of the weather, especially when it comes to exposing myself to the rain. \nThese are some of the unwritten rules for people living with HIV. Never expose yourself to rain, cold or dust. Never ever. You may survive, but you don\u2019t want to deal with the consequences of disobeying HIV\u2019s unwritten rules.\nThere\u2019s another reason why I\u2019ve never taken walks in the compound since I arrived. The person who received us said it was safe to walk around, although one may occasionally encounter a bear.\n\u201cIf you encounter a bear, don\u2019t panic. Go on your way calmly and don\u2019t show your fear. Bears are friendly animals and unless provoked, they don\u2019t attack humans.\u201d \nThe last thing I want to deal with is a bear. Its docility is not for Asunta to prove.\nSaturday evening. We\u2019re all set for the awards. I\u2019m the first on the podium. My, I\u2019m being feted in the world\u2019s numero uno city: New York. \nI feel humbled. There are two people I wish could have been here to witness this. One is my father. I know he would have stood with me after I tested HIV-positive. I know. And he would have been proud of me today.\nThe other person is the principal who disclosed my HIV status in the most inhuman way ever. I wish she was here to witness how God rewrote her tragic script.\nI start my presentation by showing a person being given home-based care. He can barely walk without the assistance of a community volunteer worker. There\u2019s progress. \nThe person is now mentoring others in a group therapy. Besides, he is rearing dairy goats that provide his family with milk. \nThe other awardees share their stories. Stories of pain. One from Afghanistan has been struggling to make the situation of the common man known, as stronger nations struggle.\nHe has been arrested and kidnapped to stop him from telling the world the story of war in Afghanistan. \nHe shows where he works in cafes without water, electricity or basic necessities. He walks for miles in the scorching sun to have his stories published. And he has to do it pretty quickly because if his foes get him, all his work will be destroyed. \nIt is eye-opening that some people live in fear and the devastation of war, whereas in Kenya I take so much for granted. I can hear quiet sobs as I restrain my tears, seeing pictures of massacred children and women. I make a mental note: this is a lesson to take home, especially now that we\u2019re going into a General Election.\nNext is a lady from Chile. She shares how she uses her skills to bring justice to the society. In her investigative journalism, she seeks employment in government offices where she exposes corruption. \nShe does the same in hospitals where the medical staff have no regard for human life and in the police force where bribery is rampant. She resigned several times because she said she only witnessed pain and no justice. \nLater, she reconsidered this decision and went back, saying, \u201cThe little I can do is let the world know there\u2019s injustice in the world.\u201d \nI return home the following day reasoning that my situation isn\u2019t as bad as those of the other awardees. I\u2019m grateful that God has placed me in a far better place to serve humanity."}
