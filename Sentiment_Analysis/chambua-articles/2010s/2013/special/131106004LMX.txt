{"text": "Do not forget how\ndestructive HIV is\nIN THE \u201cDARK DAYS\u201d, the birth of a child to\na mother living with HIV was, in some cases,\nfrowned upon. There was no prevention of\nmother-to-child transmission. Most of us just\ntrusted God that our children would be born\nHIV-free.\nThe day I gave birth to my twins, my colleagues\nwere ecstatic. Those who know our\nhistory can attest to the fact that for a long\ntime, infant mortality was inescapable. We\nwere working in pathetic situations, mostly\ninformal settlements where the outcome of our\nintervention largely depended on God\u2019s grace\nbecause of the intense poverty.\nI particularly remember one case where this\nwoman who had lost her newborn wrapped her\nin shawls, as if she was still alive, then boarded\na public service vehicle to her home in Nyanza\nProvince. According to her, custom demanded\nthat the baby be buried upcountry, but since\nshe could not afford to transport the body,\nshe did what she had to do. Now this is real\npoverty.\nFrom the onset, I took it upon myself to ensure\nour clients lived and died in dignity. I had\nlived through the stigma that followed the announcement\nthat one was HIV-infected and the\nindignity that shadowed one to the grave.\nThey say what does not kill you only makes\nyou stronger. But searing indignity made many\npeople living with HIV to die before their time.\nIn our organisation, we do our best to keep\nour clients alive. Should we lose out to the Grim\nReaper, we do not have regrets. At times clients\nare brought to our attention when they are on\ntheir deathbeds. Still, our community health\nworkers give it their best.\nSo, if the HI virus has the upper hand, we do\nnot have regrets because of something we did\nnot do. Or something that we could have done\ndifferently that would have brought different\nresults. However, being human, we sometimes\nhave regrets, what you would call \u201cif only\u201d moments.\nLooking at the Westgate Mall siege and the\ngruesome scenes that met the first responders,\nit reminded me of what our health workers face.\nThey are inundated with death and disease.\nPost-traumatic counselling for them is always\nlong overdue.\nAnd it does not make matters any easier that\nmost of them are living with HIV and/or caring\nfor loved ones living with the virus. They have\nformed bonds with their clients. When a client\npasses away, it is not only a personal loss, it can\nalso feel as if a part of them has died.\nWith comprehensive care and support,\nthe number of HIV-related deaths has drastically\nreduced. But that does not mean we are\nanywhere near our goal of zero Aids-related\ndeaths.\nOur health workers have kept us in business\nand kept lives and hopes alive by their work\nethic. They do not throw in the towel, whether\nthey lose or snatch a client from the jaws of\ndeath, or whether they are also battling with\ntheir own opportunistic infections.\nThis attitude and approach helped us cope\nduring those times when we lost several clients\nin a week. We had become regular clients at\nthe City Mortuary and the Lang\u2019ata Cemetery.\nI am sorry to say this, but I hate visits to these\ntwo places although many times I do not have\na choice.\nThe flipside is that these two places remind\nme of the frailty of life. They are stark reminders\nthat life should be lived with all the time and\ntalents that my Creator has blessed me with.\nBecause, once I am on that cold morgue slab or\nunder that mound of earth, there is no take two.\nTimes have changed, thanks to advances in the\nmedical science. Couples living with HIV can\nnow have babies without dying of stress.\nComing from this grim background, the news\nof the birth of even a single child in KENWA,\nwhether from an HIV-infected or uninfected\nstaff or client, is received with a lot of gratitude\nto God. This is the promotion God has given us.\nWe can now celebrate new lives. Before, we felt\ndamned, what with countless baby deaths from\nAids-related complications.\nWe still have a long way to go. That is why\nit disturbs me when I hear that, given a choice,\nsome girls fear unplanned pregnancies more\nthan they do HIV-infection. It is as if our familiarity\nwith HIV has now bred forgetfulness. Sad.\nWE DO OUR BEST TO KEEP OUR CLIENTS ALIVE\nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother-of-five who tested HIV-positive 26 years ago. She\nis the executive director of the Kenya Network"}
