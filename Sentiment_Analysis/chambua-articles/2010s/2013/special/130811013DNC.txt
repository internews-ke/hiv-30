{"text": "Will Kenya gift the world the\nfirst drug that kills Aids virus?\nElusive:\nA cure for\nAids has\neluded the\nbest scientific\nminds ever\nsince HIV\nwas discovered\nin 1984\nThe last thing I would have\nexpected is that a place associated\nwith apes would be\na centre of cutting edge medical\nresearch, especially on HIV of all\nthings.\nI wasn\u2019t even familiar with the Institute\nof Primate Research (IPR)\nwhich \u2013 odder still \u2013 is an adjunct\nnot of some medical facility but of\nthe National Museums of Kenya,\nwhich now falls under the Sports,\nArts and Culture ministry.\nIt is this IPR where the other day\nI learned some very serious inroads\nare being made against the virus that\ncauses Aids. Some background is in\norder.\nA cure for Aids has eluded the\nbest scientific minds ever since\nHIV was identified in 1984. That\nis despite billions upon billions of\ndollars being spent by governments,\ntop-notch universities, research institutes,\npharmaceutical companies\nand foundations to find a cure. An\nAids vaccine looks an even more\nremote prospect.\nAccording to Dr Peter Gichuhi\nMwethera, a reproductive health\nspecialist and lead researcher in the\nIPR study, part of the problem is that\nscience has been focusing more on\nunderstanding the HIV virus itself,\nrather than just dealing with what\nit does to the body.\nBasically what the researchers\nhave done is to come up with a\nmicrobicide called Unipron (a gel,\nreally) that kills the virus once it is\nintroduced inside a woman\u2019s genital\nsystem. I\u2019ll spare you the technical\ndetails of how it works, which a layman\nwill have trouble following. The\ninitial trials were done with baboons\nbecause, I am told, they best approximate\nthe human physiology (did you\nknow baboons menstruate?). Those\ninitial trials have been completed and\nfound to yield good results.\nAll the Aids medication available\nsuch as ARVs combats the virus\nwhen it has already infected the\nbody. There is nothing in the world\nso far that destroys the thing once\nit has entered the bloodstream, or\nwhich can remove it entirely from\nthe body.\nThere are scores of anti-HIV gels\nthat are being tested all over the\nworld. In Africa, Unipron is unique\nbecause it is the only such product\nthat is on the threshold of getting\nprofessional approval for clinical trials.\nThis is the most critical stage\nin drug development; it involves\ntesting the product not on animals,\nbut on actual human beings. Only\nafter successfully passing through\nclinical trials can a drug be licensed\nfor the market.\nCould this be another Kemron\nin the making, I wondered? There\nare those who remember the \u201cAids\nwonder drug\u201d that was once peddled\nat political rallies during Daniel\narap Moi\u2019s time. The whole thing\nended up in confusion and embarrassment.\nOne of the researchers\nbehind Kemron later came up with\nanother anti-Aids \u201cmedication\u201d\ncalled Pearl Omega which turned\nout to be a dodo, too. It reportedly\nhad side-stepped all known medical\nresearch protocols.\nDr Mwethera is decidedly not\ngoing that route. He is partnering\nwith the Aga Khan and the\nNairobi hospitals for clinical trials\nonce the ethics boards of the two\ninstitutions grant the vital approval.\nIPR\u2019s overseer and director-general\nof the National Museums of Kenya,\nDr Farah Idle, who is a pathologist,\ndescribed the anticipated trials as\n\u201cvery promising\u201d. Similar sentiments\nwere expressed by Unipron\u2019s co-collaborator\nat Aga Khan Hospital, Dr\nAlfred Murage, a gynaecologist.\nTwo other related products that\noriginate from IPR research are\nalready past trials and are on the\nmarket. One, Smugel, is a reproductive\nlubricant while the other,\nSmuscan, is used for ultrasound\nscans on pregnant women.\nAlready, the African Union has\ntaken note of Unipron. At the AUorganised\nAll Africa Public Sector\nInnovation Awards ceremony held\nin Brazzaville last month, Unipron\nwon one of the top prizes among innovations\ndeemed likely to become\nvery beneficial to the public across\nthe continent.\ngwarigi@ke.nationmedia.com\nDr Mwethera will partner with\nthe Aga Khan and Nairobi\nhospitals for clinical trials\nonce approval is granted\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s now the turn of\nyoung scholars to break\nnew ground for Africa\u2019s\nresurgence through innovative\nresearch geared towards\nAfrican transformation.\nYounger intellectuals should\nexpand our horizons of imagination\nand creativity to\nforge practical solutions\nthat can yield measurable\nresults\u201d \u2014 Retired\nPresident Mwai Kibaki\u2019s\nreflections on African\nuniversities last week.\nOPINION MAKERS | What they said\n\u201cWe want to ensure\nnobody is discriminated\nagainst on the basis of tribe\nor gender during recruitment\n...
