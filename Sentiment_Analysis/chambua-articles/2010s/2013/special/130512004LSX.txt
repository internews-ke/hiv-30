{"text": "Controversial condom advert\nKenya EpiscopalConference says\nCatholics for Choice is not a Catholicorganisation whilethe group claims the bishops do not represent the will of all\nCatholics\n\nkkiberenge@ke.nationmedia.com\n\nIt all started with a full-pageadvert in the Sunday Nation and a billboard near the Consolata ShrineCatholic Church in Nairobi.\nIn the adverts, a US-based organisation\n\u2014 Catholics for Choice (CFC)\n\u2014 was urging Catholic faithful to embrace condom use, against the church\u2019s position which supports abstinence for they yet-to-marry and faithfulness among the married.\nAs the storm kicked off by the\nadverts settles, Catholic faithful in the country are divided on the way forward over the controversial and divisive condom debate.\nThe advert said: \u201cWe believe in\nGod, we believe that sex is sacred, we believe in caring for each other, we\nbelieve in using condoms and good\nCatholics use condoms.\u201d\nOn its website, the organisation\nsays the adverts are being\nrun as part of an initiative dubbed\n\u201cCondoms4Life\u201d. The initiative \u201cis\nan unprecedented worldwide public\neducation effort to raise public awareness\nabout the devastating effect of\nthe bishops\u2019 ban on condoms\u201d.\nThe billboard that stood near the\nConsolata Shrine Catholic Church in\nWestlands was seen by the Catholic\nleadership in Kenya as a direct jibe.\nA few days after the advert appeared,\nthe Kenya Episcopal Conference,\nled by John Cardinal Njue, came\nout with guns blazing and disowned\nthe adverts.\n\u201cThese adverts deliberately ridicule\nthe Catholic teaching on responsible\nsexual behaviour across all ages and\nquickly proclaim the use of condoms,\u201d\ncharged Cardinal Njue.\nHe added: \u201cCatholics for Choice\nare not Catholics in the sense of the\nOne, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic\nChurch. Catholics are Pro-Life and\nnot Pro-Choice.\u201d\nThey tried\nNairobi auxiliary bishop David\nKamau \u2013 Cardinal Njue\u2019s assistant\nin the Archdiocese of Nairobi \u2013 told\nLifestyle that they have unsuccessfully\ntried to trace the people behind\nthe adverts.\n\u201cThey are anonymous because\nwe have tried to look for them but\nhaven\u2019t located anyone,\u201d said Bishop\nKamau.\nIndeed, the adverts were placed\nthrough an advertising agency based\nin San Francisco, US. The bishops\nhave advised Catholics to ignore the\nadverts, saying the communication\nwas not from the Catholic Church.\n\u201cWe wish to assure all the Catholics\nand people of goodwill that the stand\nof the Universal Catholic Church on\ncondom use has not changed,\u201d said\nthe bishops.\nThe statement by the Kenya Episcopal\nConference drew a counter\nreaction from the CFC leaders in the\nUS, who faulted the bishops\u2019 stance.\n\u201cThe campaign is vital,\u201d said CFC\npresident and campaign co-ordinator\nJon O\u2019Brien, \u2018because the bishops\u2019\nrecent activities are not representative\nof Catholic teachings or beliefs.\nCatholics do support the use of condoms,\nand they do use them to protect\nthemselves and their partners.\u201d\nMr O\u2019Brien said the ad was based\non good science since more than 1.6\nmillion people are living with HIV\nand Aids in Kenya, and condoms are\nan evidence-based method for preventing\nthe spread of the HIV.\n\u201cThere are a billion Catholics\naround the world, and here in Kenya\nwe represent a third of the population.\nOn the issue of condom use\nthe Kenyan bishops don\u2019t speak for\nCatholics here in Nairobi, or anywhere\nelse,\u201d said O\u2019Brien.\nBut according to Cardinal Njue,\nsex should be practised in the context\nof marriage. In the Catholic doctrine\nagainst contraceptives, married couples\nare encouraged to be faithful in\ntheir marriage while the young people\nare encouraged to abstain until\nmarriage.\nCanon Prof Joseph Galgalo, Vice-\nChancellor, St Paul\u2019s University, however,\nsays the condom debate should\nbe detached from the moral question\nof sex outside marriage.\n\u201cIf there are discordant married\ncouples, they should be allowed to\nuse condoms to guard against HIV\ntransmission and reinfection,\u201d said\nProf Galgalo. \u201cSingle people should\nabstain.\u201d\nThe Anglican Church canon says\npeople who are single but sexually\nactive should not claim to profess\nany faith.\nBut the hardline stance by Catholic\nbishops on condom use has been\nattacked as being out of touch with\nreality.\nA recent international poll found\nthat Catholics in Ghana, Ireland,\nMexico, the US and the Philippines\nbelieve using condoms for HIV prevention\nis pro-life because they help\nsave lives.\nAnd in 2006, a survey conducted\nby Steadman (now Synovate) revealed\nthat more Catholics support\nuse of condoms compared to followers\nof other faiths.\n\u201cIt is very apparent that the Catholic\nchurch\u2019s official position is at odds\nwith most of its members, and thus\nneeds to do a lot more work in its\npursuit of its policy in this particular\narea, or simply tolerate their dissent,\u201d\nsaid a section of the report.\nThe Synovate survey results\nprompted Mombasa Archbishop\nBoniface Lele to declare that some\nadjustments were needed on the issue.\n\u201cWith some counselling \u2013 and\nthis is something we don\u2019t tell everyone\n\u2013 you can ask couples to use\ncondoms, so that the rate of reinfection\ngoes down,\u201d he was quoted as\nsaying.\nIn 2010, Emeritus Pope Benedict\nXVI said condom use can be justified\nin some cases to help stop the spread\nof Aids. The one example he cited as\na possibly appropriate use was by\nmale prostitutes.\nHardline stance\nBishop Kamau, however, argues\nthat the ban on contraception only\ntargets believers and practitioners of\nthe Catholic teachings.\n\u201cHow many people read the Bible\nbut do not practise what it says?\u201d\nposed the bishop.\nBut the hardline stance has also\nbeen dismissed as untenable, especially\nin sub-Saharan Africa where\nHIV infection rate remains high.\nLast year alone, 1.2 million people\ndied from Aids-related causes in the\nregion alone, according to a report by\nUNAids. And in 2011, an estimated\n23.5 million people living with HIV\nresided in sub-Saharan Africa, representing\n69 per cent of the global HIV\nburden. According to the Kenya Aids\nEpidemic Update (2011) by the National\nAids Control Council, around\n92,000 new infections are being recorded\nevery year in Kenya.\nBut despite the grim statistics, the\nchurch in Kenya has consistently\nsabotaged efforts to combat the\nscourge, particularly those touching\non condom use.\nIn March, the government was\nforced to pull down an advert which\nencouraged promiscuous partners in\nmarriages to use condoms. Anglican\nChurch\u2019s Bishop Julius Kalu said the\nadvert promoted extra-marital affairs\nand sex among school pupils.\n\u201cThere are better ways of passing\nuseful information to society. This\none has certainly failed,\u201d he said.\nfeature\nKenya Episcopal\nConference says\nCatholics for Choice\nis not a Catholic\norganisation while\nthe group claims\nthe bishops do not\nrepresent the will of all\nCatholics\nControversial condom advert\nThe number of Kenyans living\nwith HIV and Aids.\n1.6m\nNumber of married people testing\npositive for HIV infections\nin Kenya per over 100\n44pc\nThe year then Pope Benedict\nsaid use of condom is justifiable\nin some instances\n2010\nHeartening"}
