{"text": "The collective effort of\nvarious stakeholders in\nthe national response\nto the HIV/AIDS epidemic in\nKenya is recording steady\ngains, with the latest Kenya\nAIDS Indicator Survey (KAIS\n2012) demonstrating the\nimpact of HIV prevention,\ncare and treatment services.\nPreliminary results of the\nKAIS 2012 show that there\nhas been a drop in national\nprevalence among adults\naged 15 to 64 years from\n7.2% in the last KAIS survey\nconducted in 2007 to 5.6% in\n2012.\nWhile most regions recorded\na decline in HIV prevalence,\nparticularly in Coast, Rift\nValley and Nairobi regions,\nthe prevalence in Nyanza\nand Central remained the\nsame since the last survey\nin 2007.\nA combination of factors\nmay have contributed to the\nchange in prevalence. These\ninclude declines in the rate of\nnew HIV infections in certain\npopulation groups, continued\nmortality among HIV-infected\npersons not accessing\ntreatment, and improved\nsurvey methods. Further\ninvestigation is ongoing and\nwill be presented in the KAIS\n2012 final report.\nResults also show that the\nage group with the highest\nprevalence has changed. The\nKAIS 2007 showed that those\naged 25 to 34 years had the\nhighest prevalence (10.5%),\nwhile the latest survey\nshowed that prevalence was\nhighest among those aged\n45 to 54 years (9.1%).\nKAIS 2012 is the first national\nsurvey in Kenya to determine\nthe HIV prevalence in children\naged 18 months to 14 years.\nThe survey found that about\n0.9% of all children aged 18\nmonths to 14 years (about\n104,000 children) were HIV\npositive.\nOnly six out of ten of these\nchildren\u2019s parents did not\nknow their child was infected,\nmeaning the child was not\nplaced on antiretroviral\nmedication to treat HIV\ninfection or receiving other\nmedical services to improve\nhealth.\nMore work needed to\nget people who are in\nneed of treatment on\nantiretroviral therapy.\nNine out of ten people who\nknew they had HIV were\nreceiving HIV care and\nART to treat their infection.\nMore work needs to be\ndone to extend coverage of\nantiretroviral therapy (ART)\nwith only 63% of those eligible\nfor ART currently receiving\nantiretroviral medication.\nAmong adults who were\naware of their HIV infection\nand currently receiving ART,\n78% had achieved viral\nsuppression. This means\nthat the amount of HIV virus\nin their bodies has reached\na low enough level, allowing\nthem to live healthier and\nlonger and reduce the chance\nof giving HIV to others.\nProgress made in HIV\ntesting at ANC clinics\nand PMTCT\nAbout nine in every ten\npregnant women aged\nbetween 15-54 years were\ntested for HIV when they\nattended antenatal care. Of\nthose testing positive, 90%\nwere given medication for themselves and/or for their infants to prevent the infant from\ngetting HIV.\nAll children who were diagnosed with HIV before the survey were receiving HIV care and 71%\nof them were on ART.\nMale circumcision gaining acceptance in Nyanza, where HIV prevalence is\nhighest\nAs in 2007 survey, Nyanza remains the region with the highest percentage of persons living\nwith HIV at 15.1%. The northern part of Eastern Kenya has the lowest at 2.1%.\nThe circumcision campaign is recording progress, with the percentage of circumcised men\nincreasing. Nyanza region had the largest increase, from 48% in 2007 to 66% in 2012.\nIn the survey, the rate of HIV infection among uncircumcised men was five times higher than\namong those men who were circumcised (17% compared to 3%).\nHigher rates of infection occur among educated adults and widows\nMen and women who completed any secondary education had a higher rate of HIV infection than those\nwho reported no primary education. HIV prevalence was higher among women at all education levels\ncompared to men.\nFor women, the highest rate of HIV infection was among those who had completed at least some\nsecondary education (7.1%) while the lowest rate of infection was among those women with no primary\neducation (4%).\nMen who had completed primary school had twice the rate of HIV infection compared to those who had\nnot attended school (4.8% compared to 2.4%)\nHIV infection rates also varied by marital status. Men and women who had ever been widowed had a\nhigher HIV prevalence (19.2% men, 20.3% women) than those who were married or currently living with\na partner, divorced or separated, or had never been married or lived with a partner.\nThe lowest HIV prevalence was among men and women who had never been married (1.3% men, 2.7%\nwomen).\nMore Kenyans are\nbeing tested for HIV\nThe percentage of adults who\nreported having been tested\nfor HIV at least once in their\nlifetime has more than doubled\nsince 2007.\nIn the 2007 KAIS, only 34% of\nadults reported having been\ntested for HIV. Five years later,\n72% of adults reported having\nbeen tested for HIV, with more\nwomen having been tested\nthan men (80% and 63%\nrespectively).\nOf those who have taken the\ntest, 35% have been tested\nwith a sexual partner.\nIn 2012, almost half (47%) of\nthose who tested HIV positive\nwere aware they were HIVinfected.\nThis was an increase\nfrom 2007 when only 16%\nof those who tested positive\nknew they\nwere HIV-infected.\nOne out of 20 couples who\nwere tested together were\ndiscordant (one partner was\nHIV positive while the other\npartner was HIV negative).\nSurvey provides essential data on the sexual\nbehaviour and risk among youth and adults\nA new feature of the 2012 KAIS was the inclusion of a behavioural\nquestionnaire for youth aged 10 to 14 years. Children aged 12 to 14\nyears were asked about sexual behaviour and 7% of them said they\nhad engaged in sex at least one time.\nAmong youth aged 15-24 years old, 66% of females and 59% of\nmales have had sex at least once, with one out of every five reporting\nthat their first sexual encounter occurred before they were aged 15\nyears. Males aged 15-24 years\nwere seven times more likely to have had more than one sex partner\nin the last year than women in their same age group.\nAmong adults aged 25 to 64 years, only 5% of women and 14% of\nmen reported consistently using condoms when having sex with a\nperson whose HHIV status was not known to them or different from\ntheir own HIV status.\nCertain populations are more at risk for HIV infection, although\nthey represent a small proportion of the Kenyan population. These\npopulations include people who inject drugs, men who have sex with\nmen, and people who give or receive money or favours in exchange\nfor sex.\nOnly 1 in 1,000 persons aged 15-64 years reported that they had ever\ninjected drugs, while only one in every hundred Kenyan men aged\n15-64 years reported having had sex with another man.\nIn the same age group, 4% of women and 3% of men said they had\nreceived money, goods, or favours in exchange for sex. Additionally,\n17 in 100 men aged 15-64 years had ever given money, gifts, or\nfavours in exchange for sex.\nFor more information, please contact: Head, National AIDS & STI Control Programme, P.O Box 19361- 00202,"}
