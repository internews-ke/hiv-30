{"text": "Dying of Aids too early\nThe HIV/Aids threat is back with a vengeance,\nand according to grim statistics provided\nby UNAids and the government, the virus is\nspreading fastest among the 15-24 age bracket.\nAccording to researchers, one of the reasons is\nthat na\u00efve youths do not care about infections; they\nare more interested in being the stigma associated\nwith unwanted pregnancies.\nThen there is an equally appalling reason.\nCommercial sex workers are increasingly being\nforced to give in to the demands of their clients for\nunprotected sex so long as the clients pay them\nmore money. They then swallow anti-retrovirals\ndrugs in the hope the pills will keep HIV at bay.\nIt is, therefore, time parents, the government,\nschools, religious organisations, NGOs, the media\nand other well-meaning societal institutions played\na more proactive role in creating awareness and\neducating these youths of the dangers they face if\nthey do not protect themselves.\nElaborate sex education is no longer a choice. If\nwe don\u2019t do something now, the virus will suck us\nall into a vortex in which Kenyans are robbed of\ntheir lives in the flower of their youth."}
