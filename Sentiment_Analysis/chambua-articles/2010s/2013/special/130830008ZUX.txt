My doctor was kind enough\nto hold my hand. He advised me that\nyou just cannot trust anyone with\nyour status, until I got sick and had\nto tell someone at home. I loved my\nbrother and thought he was the best\nbut I was wrong. As soon as he found\nout, so did Mum and my big sister. I\nwas disappointed when my mother\ncame to hospital and had to hear the\nnews from my doctor. She cried and\nthought that was the death of me\nuntil we both received counselling\nfrom my doctor. We all thought Dad\nwould react negatively, so we kept it\nfrom him.\nAt home everything became\ncomplicated, from diet to attitude\nto frustrations. Mother was always\nmaking me eat greens. It was very\nthoughtful of her, but I wanted her\nto treat me the way she always had\nbefore. She even asked me to move\nmy toothbrush to my room, away\nfrom the rest because of my small\nsister.\nThe little things people do when\nthey consider you to be different\neventually change your attitude\ntowards life and people. My mother\ndid not want me to do her laundry,\nthe way I used to do before, ostensibly\nbecause I would get tired. I remember\nonce making supper before\nshe got home. When she arrived,\nshe asked, \u201cWhy did you cook this\nand not that?\u201d Deep down, I knew\nthat she felt frustrated but did not\nknow how to tell me about it.\nMy brother told me that he had\nnever seen someone so brave, that\nin my situation, he would have\nended his life. That is not the kind\nof advice a person in my position\nneeds. However, I have to take\nheart. He even told me that it would\nbe better for me to stay at home and\njust watch movies instead of going\nto school.\nI did not want to be HIV-positive\nat the age of 20, or any other\nage, for that matter. My youth was\ndistorted even before the orange\nlight came on. I had completed\nhigh school a virgin and promised\nmyself and my mother to remain\npure until after marriage. However,\npeer pressure got to me and I was\nswayed by the hype among teenage\ngirls of, \u201cI will break my virginity\non my first Valentine after school...\u201d,\nTWENTY\n& POSITIVE\nIT ONLY EVER TAKES A FEW MINUTES OF MISGUIDED\nFUN TO LAND IN A DITCH THAT CHANGES YOUR LIFE\nFOREVER.

He promised that he pay\nfor my tuition at a private university\nand marry me. I was really excited,\nthinking that I did not need to go\nback home.\nIt was getting late and my parents\nand siblings started calling\nme on my phone. Dominic asked\nme to switch it off as the ringing\nwas spoiling \u201cthe mood\u201d. I obeyed\nwithout hesitation.\nDominic was very good with\nwords. He began making passes at\nme, which I innocently ignored at\nfirst. I eventually gave in because\nI thought it was fine as he was\ngoing to be my husband as soon\nas I turned 18.

In the\nevening I took a walk with Russel.\nI excitedly told him everything that\nhad happened, but he did not seem\nto be happy. He took me to a chemist\nand bought me contraceptive\npills, telling me, \u201cYou can never be\nsure about the future.\u201d We had a lot\nof fun, watching movies and sleeping\nthat Sunday night. However,\nDominic seemed unwell, I thought\nit was just a hangover. I felt like a\nwoman who was about to get married\nto a noble and sweet man.\nOn Monday morning I switched\non my phone and found a number\nof missed calls from my parents\nand siblings. When my sister got\nthrough, she scolded me and told\nme that our mother was very worried.\nI could not help but cry at my\nsister\u2019s words. I explained what was\nhappening to Dominic and he offered\nto take me to the bus stage. I\nwas astounded. I thought he would\naccompany me to my home to tell\nmy parents that he loves me and\nwanted to marry me. Dominic escorted\nme to the stage and did not\neven bid me farewell the way I imagined\na person in love should.\nI found my parents very angry\nand hid in my bedroom for two\ndays to avoid them. When my father\nfinally decided to talk to me,\nhe said that was not the way people\nresolved problems. I could not tell\nanyone about Dominic because he\nhad not given me the go-ahead to\ntalk about our supposed newfound\nlove. I decided to quit my job and\nthink about my life.\nDominic did not call the whole\nweek to find out how his \u201clove\u201d\nwas doing. I decided to call him but\nhis phone was switched off. I was\nheartbroken and decided to take up\na short course to occupy my mind.\nI fell ill and when I went to hospital,\nI was told that I had malaria. I took\nthe drugs prescribed and recovered.\nLater, I got a sexually transmitted\ninfection and my lymph nodes were\nswollen.

My number one\nwish is for the invention of a cure\nfor this disease.\nThis article is a first-person account\ngiven by Millicent (not her real name),\na college student whose life turned\ndrastically unlike she had planned.\neven though I had not found the\nperfect person for me.\nI have always been positive towards\nlife, ready to face the world.\nSo after my computer studies, I\ntook up a job as a secretary/office\nmessenger at a relative\u2019s office.\nThe salary was not that much, but\nI knew that you have to start somewhere.\nMy father was not happy because\nhe thought the job would prevent\nme from continuing my studies.\nHe insisted that I quit, but I did not\nwant to just sit at home waiting to\njoin the university.\nWhen I got my first salary, I was\nreally excited and decided to buy\nsomething to take home. After\nsupper, my father asked me if I\nhad made up my mind about what\nI wanted to study in college. I had\na passion for journalism but he did\nnot consider it a worthy career. I\nrefused to be coerced into taking\na course of his choice. That night\nmarked the turn of events at home.\nMy father got agitated and started\nshouting at me angrily, even saying\nthat he would not pay my tuition\nfees. I still remember his words,\n\u201cAta sitakulipia io university unataka\nkuenda, utakaa hivyo tuone.\u201d\nFor a moment I thought I had\nlost my father\ncompletely. I\ncried bitterly and\nwent to bed unusually\nearly, wondering\nwhat to do next. I felt as if\nmy life had come to an end, that\nmy future had been shattered, and\nthat I would end up hopeless. I had\nno one to talk to except my phone,\nwhich I still consider to be my best\nfriend. I was almost turning 18 and\nkept thinking that if he was not going\nto pay my fees, then I had better\nget a life.\nThe following day I woke up late\nand did laundry in the afternoon.\nI received a call from this guy,\nDominic (not his real name). I did\nnot know him well. He had got my\nnumber from a high school mate.\nHe invited me out. He sounded\nvery promising. I thought he would\nbe my prince charming as I had\nalready fallen for his voice and the\nway he spoke English. I got dressed\nSOMETIMES I TRY TO HIDE THE\nPAIN OF NOT FEELING THE LOVE\nOF MY FAMILY, THE FEELING OF\nINDIFFERENCE...\nand left, telling no one where I\nwas heading as I was sure that I\nwas never going back home. I felt\nunwanted and without a future. I\nthought this would be the beginning\nof a new life. It sure was.\nDominic, accompanied by his\nfriend, Russel (also not his real\nname), picked me up near my home.\nHe was not physically attractive,\nbut I did not want to go back home.\nWe had dinner at a restaurant, then\nlater went to his friend\u2019s apartment\nfor soft drinks and to watch a movie\nas we got to know each other. At\naround 9pm, Francis, the owner of\nthe apartment, joined us. He suggested\nthat we drink beer instead,\nbut I declined as I had never taken\nalcohol before. Dominic insisted\nthat there was special red wine in\nthe fridge just for me. I had never\ndrank wine before, but I knew from\nthe soap operas I watched on television\nthat it created that special\nmood. Dominic told me that the alcohol in the wine was so little that\nit would not affect me, that it was\njust be like drinking soda.\nSo I agreed to drink some. After\nsome time, Dominic asked me to\naccompany him to the balcony so\nthat we could have some privacy.\nWe got to talk and share a lot. I even\ntold him about my argument with\nmy father.
