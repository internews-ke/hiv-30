Teachers and\nparents joined the debate over whether\nthe book was the right content to be\nstudied in school.\nThe discussion was ignited by\na scene in the book where one of\nAchebe\u2019s characters, a university student\nnicknamed \u2018Irre\u2019, the short form\nof the word irresponsible, walks out of\nhis hostel room glistening with sweat\nand holding a used condom. It is to\nprove to his friends that he has bedded\nthe most \u201cimpossible\u201d woman to\ntake to bed.\nLeaders of the Catholic Church did\nnot like the scene. They voiced their\nobjection to the book, arguing that it\nencouraged immorality. They also said\nsomething about family values and sex\noutside marriage. Nonetheless, the\nbook, parents, and the teachers won.\nIn the same year (2004), then\nCatholic head in Kenya, Archbishop\nNdingi Mwana a\u2019Nzeki, dismissed\nthe use of the condom as protection\nagainst HIV infection. He said during\nan interview: \u201cFor me, a condom is not\nthe answer. In fact, in this country, I\nwould say without fear that the use of\ncondoms has been the greatest means\nof increasing the cases of Aids. Take\nour university students, students in\nschools of higher studies, where condoms\nare available upon demand. It\u2019s\nlike saying, \u2018my son or daughter, you\nare free.\u2019 And they do it.\u201d\nTwo years later during a religious\nleader\u2019s conference, Archbishop Ndingi\nurged the government to ban advertising\nand distribution of condoms. His\nreasons where that the easy access to\nthem encouraged promiscuity.\nCatholic leaders in the country have\nsince remained adamant on their stand\nabout the use of condoms. It is a big\nNo for them, but a section of the faithful,\nas explored yesterday in our sister\npublication, Lifestyle, is rebelling. It\nis not that they haven\u2019t been, only\nthat this time round, the boldness by\nwhich they are doing so is out there\nfor all to see.\nIt comes through a lobby group\ngoing by the name Catholics for Choice\n(CFC), and the huge billboards they\nerected recently in the country to urge\nCatholics to use condoms as a preventive\nmechanism against HIV. \u201cGood\nCatholics Use Condoms,\u201d screamed\nthe message.\nBased in the US, Catholics for\nChoice describe themselves as \u201cpart\nof the great majority of the faithful in\nthe Catholic Church who disagree with\nthe dictates of the Vatican on matters\nrelated to sex, marriage, family life,\nand motherhood\u201d.\nThe message they put up on the\nbillboards could have rubbed Catholic\nleaders in the country the wrong way,\nbut the lobby group insists that their\nstand is pegged on realities around\nthe trends in the HIV figures and the\nhuge numbers that make the Catholic\ncommunity.\nSome statistics were displayed\nrecently after another controversial\ncondom campaign, Weka Condom\nMpangoni, was criticised by men of\nthe cloth in general, and not only\nCatholic leaders.\nThe campaign was sponsored by\nPopulation Services International\n(PSI). The message, loosely translated\nas \u201chave the condom in mind\u201d, was\ndirected at married couples. It was to\nadvise them to always have a condom\nat hand should they be tempted to go\nastray.\nReligious leaders, both Christian\nand Muslim, criticised it for promoting\ninfidelity and for make a joke of the\nsacred institution of marriage. They\ndemanded for its withdrawal from the\ntelevision screens.\nIn response, the promoters\nexplained that the campaign was informed\nby the reality that as much a"}
