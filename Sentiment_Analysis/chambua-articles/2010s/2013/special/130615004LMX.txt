{"text": "Stop it, I\u2019m not a member\nof the Illuminati \n\n\u201cASUNTA, I\u2019VE HEARD that you\u2019re now\na member of the Illuminati,\u201d someone\nwrote on my Facebook wall last year.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. Let\u2019s meet at our church\nand have coffee,\u201d I replied, because I\nhad had enough and did not mind what\npeople were saying as long as I knew I\nwas right with God. What I was doing,\nbasically, was calling this person\u2019s bluff.\nIn my life, I have had tonnes of sticks,\nstones, and abuses thrown my way, so I\nhave developed a thick skin. One of the\nthings I have learnt is that whatever I do\nor do not do, someone somewhere will\nalways say something negative.\nGot the \u201cI\u2019m HIV-Positive\u201d T-shirt\nIt reminds me of years back when some\npeople claimed that I was not HIVpositive.\nThat I was doing this to make\nmoney. This is not a business: it is a\nmatter of life and death.\nI wish these people would have been\nable to see through my skin and into my\ninternal organs and witnessed what this\nvirus was doing to me.\nThey do not know about my sleepless\nnights and killer side effects of drugs\nthat are supposed to prolong my life, the\nstigma and discrimination, and the whole\nmaddening kit that HIV throws.\nJust because I have dodged death\nthis long, played hide-and-seek with\nopportunistic infections, and appear to\nbe hale and hearty does not mean that\nI am less HIV-positive than other people\nwho are living with HIV.\nThe price of fame\nThe Facebook incident happened after\nI had heard through the grapevine the\nrumours some people were spreading\nabout me. That I had sold my soul to the\ndevil.\nI had to Google-search it\nI did not know what Illuminati meant.\nI had to Google-search it find out\nwhat the word means. I heard that I,\ntogether with several other prominent\npersonalities whom I had never met,\nbelonged to the Illuminati.\nThere are things with weight and\nsubstance that demand a right of reply.\nAnd there are other insinuations that one\nshould not even waste their time and\nbreathe replying to. For the longest time,\nI have wanted to share this, but I told\nmyself that I would be stooping to these\npeople\u2019s level.\nSilence is golden, but it can also be taken\nas a sign of consent. To set the record\nstraight, I am giving you all the secret\norganisations I belong to. Be warned, this\nis highly classified stuff, people.\nThey are Kenya Network of Women with\nAids (KENWA), my family of one partner\nand six children, my Bible-believing\nchurch, my women\u2019s chama, and my\ngroup therapy.\nThe cause of all bad things\n\u201cShe was involved in a car accident \u2026\nshe disappeared for several days and\nreappeared with a new car.\u201d\n\u201cSee all these people who are dying? She\nhas a hand in their deaths. They are the\nhuman sacrifices she\u2019s giving for more\nwealth.\u201d\nThese are just some of the things some\npeople have been saying to back their\nclaims that I worship the devil.\nFor starters, vehicle accidents have been\nhappening since Ford rolled the first car\noff the assembly line.\nI do not know the statistics, but I guess\ntens of accidents happen on Kenyan\nroads daily. If they are caused by the\nIlluminati, then why are we even talking\nabout traffic rules?\nBecause my car was written off, I\nobviously had to get a new one. That is\nmy mode of transport.\nWealth is viewed with morbid suspicion\nSince I signed on the dotted line that I\nwould be working in this field, I literally\npoked the Grim Reaper in the eye.\nAnyone who knows me knows that I\ntry my best to save lives. That I even\nuse my own resources to make sure our\nmembers live longer, fulfilled lives.\nThe other thing that has prompted some\nto conclude that I am in the Illuminati\nis the obvious. Blessings of wealth and\nhealth that God has graciously bestowed\nupon me.\nI have realised that in some socioeconomic\nquarters, wealth is viewed with\nmorbid suspicion. Especially for a person\nlike me who barely two decades ago was\nliving in a one-room house in Kayole,\nwhich I could ill afford.\nYet now God has blessed me with a\nhome in the suburbs.\nIn essence, we are saying that God\u2019s\nblessings business went under and now\nSatan has the monopoly. If we will not\nditch our stinking thinking, I am afraid\nthat we will not be able to pursue and\npossess the wondrous blessings God has\nin store for us.\nYes, I am not perfect. I am just a woman\nwho is being favoured by God.\nSend your questions to our experts\non children\u2019s rights and family law"}
