{"text": "The miracle healing\nthat never was\n\nON MANY OCCASIONS, people or interviewers ask me what my lowest moment\nin life is. I have about 10. Recently, one was literally brought home.\nI saw preacher Reinhard Bonnke\u2019s TV advertisement and my mind went back 26-or-so years ago. I had heard that he was coming to the country. He was known to pray for all kinds of ailments, including Aids. I badly wanted to be healed of this condition, whatever the cost. There was one hitch: distance. His\ncrusade would be held in Kisumu. I was penniless, so I lied to a friend that I had been invited to another nursing school.\nThe only obstacle was Sh800. She had been very sympathetic that\nat my age, and having gone to secondary school together, my life was in tatters. I never told her that I had HIV,\nwhich at that time was as good as telling someone you were dead.\n\u201cIf I get the money, I\u2019ll return with an admission number and join college next year,\u201d I lied.\nLong road to healing\nI boarded the eight o\u2019clock train to\nKisumu, set for healing the following\nday at the town\u2019s stadium, never mind\nthat I had never set foot in Kisumu.\nThere were many unwelcome things\non the train, but I did not allow myself\nto be distracted. Women who boarded\nalong the way came with \u201cschools\u201d of\nchildren. As a result, each Nairobi-to-\nKisumu passenger, including me, was\nallocated a sleeping infant.\nWe fed and changed the babies\u2019 nappies,\nand since I had not carried an extra\ndress, I had to be extra careful not to\nsoil it. On reaching Kisumu, it was not\nhard to know the crusade\u2019s venue. I followed\na big crowd that was headed to\nthe stadium. I wondered if there were\npeople in the crowd infected with HIV,\nor whether I was the only one.\nFalling faith\nWe sat in the scorching sun and waited. It was reassuring to hear other\npeople\u2019s testimonies. Although most\npeople spoke Dholuo, some explained\nin English how their friends in Nairobi\nhad benefited from Bonnke. I planned\nto approach the altar immediately\nBonnke started preaching because if\nI waited for the altar call, the crowd\nwould be overwhelming. This worked\nperfectly. I was about five metres from\nwhere he was fanning the healing cloth,\nmaking people to fall. I did not fall. I\nnever felt a \u201cpower\u201d pushing me to the\nground. Or perhaps it is because I did\nnot allow people to fall on me, creating\na domino effect.\nAll the same, I had faith that I was\nhealed.\nTesting the waters\nI think I felt different, or I imagined\nthat I felt different. But I had to do\none thing: confirm my healing. All the\ntests were done at the Kenya Medical\nResearch Institute (Kemri). I went there\nfiguring what to say if I found the same\nperson who had tested me the last time.\nI mean, if I had tested HIV-positive, why\nwould I want to retest? Luckily, there\nwas a new man. I think they did not\nhave computer data. I told him I was\nplanning to travel abroad to study and\none of the requirements was to test for\nHIV. He was very upset that an embassy\ncould ask for such a test from an innocent\ngirl like me who was the picture of\nperfect health.\nIgnorance is bliss\nBack then, test results took eight\ndays, but I believed that I was HIV-free.\nI even wrote a lengthy letter to my\nschool, arguing my case for re-admission.\n\u201cI doubt I was HIV-infected in the\nfirst place. I will let you test me again to\nconfirm I am HIV-free and allow me to\ncomplete my studies,\u201d I wrote.\nI imagined myself going back to class\nin the stripped green uniform. Only this\ntime I vowed it would be strictly studies.\nWhen I entered the small office, I\ndid not need to be told what was up. I\ncould read the result from the person\u2019s\nface. He told me he wanted to do another\ntest because he could not believe\nthat this young and beautiful girl had\ncontracted the deadly virus. I allowed\nhim to draw another blood sample. But\nI did not go back for the result. My die\nhad been cast.\nNew healing\nWhen I saw Reinhard Bonnke\u2019s advert\nrecently, I could not help but tell my\nfamily what happened all those years\nago. I do not hate this man of God. I\nonly hate to remember that time because\neverything was without form or\nshape. Now I am grateful that God has\nhealed my mind and given me amazing\ngrace to live with this thorn in my flesh.\nIf you want to know my lowest moment,\nit was when I was \u201cHIV-negative\u201d\nfor eight blissful days.\nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a\nmother-of-five who tested HIV-positive\n25 years ago. She is the executive director\nof the Kenya Network of Women\nwith Aids (KENWA). Email:"}
