{"text": "Numbers that\ndrive the bold\ncampaigns for\ncondom use\npoduor@ke.nationmedia.com When Chinua Achebe\u2019s\nbook \u2014 A Man of the\nPeople \u2014 was being\nstudied in Kenyan\nhigh schools in 2004 as one of the\nexaminable literature texts, a war of\nwords ensued between the Catholic\nChurch in Kenya and the panel that\nhad selected the book. Teachers and\nparents joined the debate over whether\nthe book was the right content to be\nstudied in school.\nThe discussion was ignited by\na scene in the book where one of\nAchebe\u2019s characters, a university student\nnicknamed \u2018Irre\u2019, the short form\nof the word irresponsible, walks out of\nhis hostel room glistening with sweat\nand holding a used condom. It is to\nprove to his friends that he has bedded\nthe most \u201cimpossible\u201d woman to\ntake to bed.\nLeaders of the Catholic Church did\nnot like the scene. They voiced their\nobjection to the book, arguing that it\nencouraged immorality. They also said\nsomething about family values and sex\noutside marriage. Nonetheless, the\nbook, parents, and the teachers won.\nIn the same year (2004), then\nCatholic head in Kenya, Archbishop\nNdingi Mwana a\u2019Nzeki, dismissed\nthe use of the condom as protection\nagainst HIV infection. He said during\nan interview: \u201cFor me, a condom is not\nthe answer. In fact, in this country, I\nwould say without fear that the use of\ncondoms has been the greatest means\nof increasing the cases of Aids. Take\nour university students, students in\nschools of higher studies, where condoms\nare available upon demand. It\u2019s\nlike saying, \u2018my son or daughter, you\nare free.\u2019 And they do it.\u201d\nTwo years later during a religious\nleader\u2019s conference, Archbishop Ndingi\nurged the government to ban advertising\nand distribution of condoms. His\nreasons where that the easy access to\nthem encouraged promiscuity.\nCatholic leaders in the country have\nsince remained adamant on their stand\nabout the use of condoms. It is a big\nNo for them, but a section of the faithful,\nas explored yesterday in our sister\npublication, Lifestyle, is rebelling. It\nis not that they haven\u2019t been, only\nthat this time round, the boldness by\nwhich they are doing so is out there\nPreaching\nchastity\nuntil\nmarriage,\nespecially\nto the\nyoung\ngeneration,\nis like\ntrying to\ncut a rock\nusing a\nmachete\nfor all to see.\nIt comes through a lobby group\ngoing by the name Catholics for Choice\n(CFC), and the huge billboards they\nerected recently in the country to urge\nCatholics to use condoms as a preventive\nmechanism against HIV. \u201cGood\nCatholics Use Condoms,\u201d screamed\nthe message.\nBased in the US, Catholics for\nChoice describe themselves as \u201cpart\nof the great majority of the faithful in\nthe Catholic Church who disagree with\nthe dictates of the Vatican on matters\nrelated to sex, marriage, family life,\nand motherhood\u201d.\nThe message they put up on the\nbillboards could have rubbed Catholic\nleaders in the country the wrong way,\nbut the lobby group insists that their\nstand is pegged on realities around\nthe trends in the HIV figures and the\nhuge numbers that make the Catholic\ncommunity.\nSome statistics were displayed\nrecently after another controversial\ncondom campaign, Weka Condom\nMpangoni, was criticised by men of\nthe cloth in general, and not only\nCatholic leaders.\nThe campaign was sponsored by\nPopulation Services International\n(PSI). The message, loosely translated\nas \u201chave the condom in mind\u201d, was\ndirected at married couples. It was to\nadvise them to always have a condom\nat hand should they be tempted to go\nastray.\nReligious leaders, both Christian\nand Muslim, criticised it for promoting\ninfidelity and for make a joke of the\nsacred institution of marriage. They\ndemanded for its withdrawal from the\ntelevision screens.\nIn response, the promoters\nexplained that the campaign was informed\nby the reality that as much as methotraxate) in combination with\nother agents. Two patients who have\nundergone the therapy, Dr Barasa adds,\nhave shown no signs of the virus for\nthe past six months.\nMethotrexate is used to treat cancer\nbut is indicated to have very serious side\neffects and should not be used without\nadvice from a competent physician.\n\u201cAlthough the drug is available in\nlocal pharmacies on prescription,\nit must never be used without clear\ninstruction from your doctors,\u201d says\nDr Barasa.\nThe lecturer has since applied for a\npatent with the Kenya Industrial Property\nInstitute for the treatment process,\ntitled Cure for HIV/Aids Virus.\n\u201cOur methodology is simple, safe,\nacceptable, and cheap, although not yet\nscientifically validated,\u201d says Dr Barasa\nin his case study.

The\nnumber of new HIV infections among adults in 2010\nwas less than one-third the number reported in\n1993, when the country\u2019s epidemic peaked. An estimated\n49,126 people died of Aids-related causes in\n2011, slightly more than one-third the annual number\nwho died in 2002\u20132004. Sexual transmission is the\nprimary driver of Kenya\u2019s epidemic. Heterosexual\ntransmission within a union or primary partnership\naccounts for an estimated 44 per cent of new infections.\nAmong adults living with HIV, women represent\n58 per cent of prevalent infections. The large\nnumber of sexually acquired HIV infections among\nwomen has given rise to substantial transmission\nto newborns, with an estimated 12,894 children in\nKenya becoming newly infected in 2011.
