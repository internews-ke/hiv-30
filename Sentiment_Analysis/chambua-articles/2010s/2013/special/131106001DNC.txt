{"text": "Exposed: How\nyouths abuse\nHIV medicine\nBY SAMWEL BORN MAINA\n@Bornmaina\nsborn@ke.nationmedia.com\nKenyans are using emergency Aids\nmedication in place of safe sex,\naccording to health workers.\nInstead of using condoms, many young\npeople are having unsafe sex then going\nto public hospitals for the so-called PEP\npills.\nThis is a continuation of the abuse of\nemergency contraceptive pills, which\nis widespread despite its health consequences.\nPost Exposure Prophylaxis is\nCONTINUED ON PAGE 2\nWORRYING TREND | Alarm over increasing cases of people asking for pills meant to shield health professionals from infection\nYouths abusing\ndrugs meant for\nHIV emergencies\nemergency treatment, mainly for health workers and victims of sexual crimes. It is usually administered to those suspected to have come into contact with HIV-infected material.\nThe treatment must start within\n72 hours of exposure and consists of a daily dosage of six tablets taken for 28 days.\nDoctors are worried that those abusing the PEP pills do not take the full dosage, thus not only risking infection but also incubating a virus which is resistant to medication.\nThe drugs are only available in public hospitals and are provided at no cost. It is illegal for chemists to stock them.\nWhen PEP was first introduced as an emergency drug to prevent HIV infection in the early 1990s, it was praised as a scientific breakthrough.\nAt the time, it was meant for health professionals who were at great risk of being infected with the virus in the line of duty. With time, it was made available to people exposed to the virus under circumstances, such as rape or sexual assault.\nIn the recent past, however, there has been a sharp rise in the number of people seeking the drugs, after engaging in unprotected sex especially during holidays and weekends.\nMany of those asking doctors to give them the pills use them the same way others use emergency contraceptives \u2014 as an afterthought.\nMany of them claim to have had \u201caccidents\u201d which exposed them to HIV. The accidents, according to\nNyeri County Aids and Sexually-transmitted\nDiseases coordinator Jeniffer\nKiruri, range from sexual assault or a needle prick to a torn condom.\nShe said that between July and September,\nthe Nyeri Provincial General\nHospital gave the pills to more than\n100 patients, most of them young people of 16 years and above.\nThis group is one of the most at the risk of HIV infection.\nAsk doctors\nDr Enoch Ondari, the Kisii Level\nFive medical superintendent, said the health centre received requests for PEP occasionally especially during\n weekends.\n\u201cPeople do come to our facility to seek PEP services with the excuse of a burst condom. Normally, this happens during the weekends or on\nMonday morning,\u201d he said.\nHospital records indicate that more men than women ask doctors for the tablets.\nDr Martin Sirengo, the head of\nNational Aids and STI Control Programme\n(Nascop), said there had\nbeen an alarming rise in the number\nof people abusing the drugs especially after weekends.\n\u201cWe cannot deny them the drug because it is available,\u201d he said.\nBut to qualify for a prescription, one must undergo thorough testing and provide contact details to the doctor giving the tablets.\nThis procedure is meant to make it difficult for middlemen to get the drugs for free from public hospitals and resell them.\nDr Juliana Atieno, the chief administrator at Jaramogi Oginga Odinga\nTeaching and Referral Hospital in\nKisumu, said the hospital was one\nof those that had developed strict guidelines on who should get PEP.\n\u201cMany people were coming for the\ndrug,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had to lay down a\nprotocol. First, a person has to come\nwith the partner for testing,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe partner must be traced for one\nto get help.\u201d\nDr Atieno warned that the drugs\nshould not be a licence for irresponsible\nsexual behaviour.\n\u201cThe drug\u2019s effectiveness might backfire if you skip a dose. Why do you have to undergo that? You have a good option of using a condom,\u201d she said.\nMs Monica Ndegwa, the Kieni\nEast District Public Health officer, said the uptake of the drug could be because young people wanted to take short-cuts.\n\u201cJust like in pregnancy pills, young people want to take short-cuts. My advice is, before you engage in anything, know the status of your partner,\u201d she said.\nMrs Christine Otieno, a programme officer in HIV prevention at Kenyatta\nNational Hospital, said the demand for the drug shoots up especially during holidays and after weekends.\n\u201cWe counsel the users first. They must finish the dose, otherwise they may be resistant to ARVs in the event they acquire the virus,\u201d she said.\nAccording to her, some of those seeking the drug are genuine cases of rape.\n\u201cOthers come with that excuse yet they did it willingly, but we cannot deny them the service,\u201d she said.\nAdditional reporting by Muthini\nStephen\nPEP is a combination of two drugs: Aluvia and Combivin and\nis only available at no cost in public hospitals.\nA person for whom PEP has been prescribed is required to swallow six tablets in a day for 28 days. One takes three\ntablets \u2014 two Aluvia and one Combivin \u2014 twice a day.\nPEP is not a simple morningafter\npill: it is a month-long course of treatment.\nPEP treatment must begin within 72 hours of exposure to\nHIV. The sooner the treatment starts the better.\nThe drug is mostly used within the health sector as part of a\ncomprehensive precautions package that reduces staff exposure\nto infectious hazards artwork.\nAn exposed health care worker\nshould proceed with treatment\nonly after informed consent.\nAmong the common side effects\nof PEP are nausea and diarrhoea.\nBACKGROUND\nTablets must be\ntaken for 28 days"}
