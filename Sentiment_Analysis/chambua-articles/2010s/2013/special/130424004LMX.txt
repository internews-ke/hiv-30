{"text": "THIS TIME ROUND, I WANT A GIRL\nI want more children\n\nSchool holidays are here\nagain. Because I am under\npar, and the doctor has\nordered bed rest, so I am\nhome alone with my children.\nHaving Peter, Joshua,\nand Israel at home, all at the\nsame time, has its fair share\nof challenges. Not that I am\ncomplaining, though. I do not\never take it for granted that\nGod has blessed me with children.\nThey are my pride and\njoy. I know there are women\nwho do not want children\nand are living fulfilling lives.\nPersonally, I am not sure what\nmy life would be without my\nchildren.\nSo, even if during these\nholidays my three musketeers\nwill be a handful and spoil my\nbed rest, I will try as much as\npossible to savour the moments.\nI know these moments\nare fleeting and I will die\nto have them after my nest\nempties.\nTake Peter, for instance.\nJust the other year he was\nthis little boy who ran to me\nwith all his questions, like\nJoshua does. Now he runs\nto his buddies and I have to\nrespect his space, although\nhe still lives in my space.\nFor several months now, I\nhave had \u201cissues\u201d which have\ngreatly affected my health.\nBut in all this, I never abandon\nmy parental responsibilities.\nEven in bed, I crack the whip.\nAt times it is difficult for\none to balance parenting\nthree boys, living with HIV\n\u2014 which has its bad hair\ndays \u2014 and being this career\nwoman who, seemingly, has\ngot it all figured out. It is an\nact that some women have\nmastered. Some, like me, are\nstill learning.\nWhat will surprise many\npeople is that I still want to\nhave more babies. Another\nsurprise: I have never stopped\ntrying. The last time round,\nwhen God blessed me with\nIssa, I was criticised by some.\n\u201cWhat are you trying to\nprove?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re selfish\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou should be thanking\nGod for the children you have\ninstead of trying to push the\nenvelope.\u201d\nLet me just say that I have\nnot closed the conception\nchapter yet. And, who knows,\nI may pull a surprise just when\nyou are thinking that my biological\nclock has stopped for\ngood.\nI have a soft spot for children,\nespecially little girls. I\nstill have bittersweet memories\nof HIV-infected and affected\ngirl children who have\nlived under my roof and left\nlasting impressions. I may not\nalways have been the perfect\nparent to them, but I always\ndid my best. Girl, I am only\nhuman.\nWhen we were trying for\na baby and God blessed us\nwith Issa, I hoped and prayed\nit would be a girl. For my partner\nRichard, having three boys\n\u2014 he has a boy from a previous\nrelationship \u2014 makes him\nfeel three times a man.\nDo not get me wrong. I love\nboys. I would not mind if God\nblessed me with another one.\nStill, I think there is something\ninnate in most of us women.\nMany of my girlfriends have\nshared with me that they love\ngirl children. This is strange,\nbecause it is said that fathers\nand daughters have crazy\nchemistry. Yeah, I have it with\nmy boys, but I would not mind\nchemistry with a girl child\nnext time round.\nAnother chance\nI was recently watching an\ninterview of former Beatle,\nPaul McCartney. His first\nwife died of cancer and he\nhas now remarried and has\na small child. He said, and it\nresonated with me, that now\nthat he is older and has a second\nshot at parenting, things\nare different. For his older\nchildren from his first marriage,\nhe was building a career\nwhile raising a family, a factor\nthat made his children to miss\nout on a lot of things.\nI feel that the same thing\nhappened with Peter and\nme. When I had him, I was\ndodging \u201clive bullets\u201d, trying\nto find rhyme and reason\nto life after a HIV-positive\ndiagnosis, trying to find my\nfooting in the HIV world. So\nmany things were going on\nthat, although I loved him and\nhe gave me a reason to live,\nI was sometimes an absentee\nparent emotionally.\nIt is different with Joshua\nand Issa. They have me, lock,\nstock, and barrel. Sometimes,\nI can even call in absent just\nto be with them. Just so they\ncan have all of me because\nGod has given me another\nchance.\nAnd I think that I am also\nmaking up for lost time with\nPeter, although he is not always\naround.\nAnd I believe that, when,\n(not if), God blesses me with\nother children, I will grab this\nsecond chance and never let\ngo.\nThis is the diary of Asunta\nWagura, a mother-of-three\nwho tested HIV-positive 25\nyears ago.
