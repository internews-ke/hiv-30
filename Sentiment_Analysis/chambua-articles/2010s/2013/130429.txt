{"text": "Catholic Church affirms stand against condom use \nBy JAMES NGUNJIRI\n 29\u00a0 2013\u00a0 \nThe Catholic Church in Kenya on Sunday reaffirmed its stand against the use of condoms.\nThe head of Catholic Archdiocese of Nyeri in central Kenya, Archbishop Peter Kairo, said the position of the church was clearly against the use of condoms.\n\u201cAs the Catholic Church we are not promoting use of condoms. I don\u2019t agree with the advertisements on the billboards and newspapers that say Catholics believe in sex which is sacred and that they believe in using condoms,\u201d said Archbishop Kairo.\nHe was reacting to an advertisement which appeared on the Sunday Nation newspaper.\u2028The advertisement was run by Catholics for Choice movement advocating for use of condoms. \nThe advert attempts to redefine church teachings on condoms and what it means to be a good Catholic faithful. \u201cGood Catholics use condoms,\u201d the advertisement stated.\nArchbishop Kairo said the church is advocating for chastity and fidelity among couples as the best way to stop the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.\n\u201cWe as Christians should learn how to live respecting each other in the holy sacrament of marriage and I urge the youths to respect and guard themselves in our day-today as the world is not the same as the olden times,\u201d he said.\nThe Catholic Church faithful, he said, should be on the front line in promoting chastity; one man one wife and faithfulness in marriages.\nThe Archbishop stated that the Catholic Church did not comply in any way with the campaign dubbed \u201cGood Catholics Use Condoms.\u201d\nThis comes after worldwide public education efforts to raise public awareness about the devastating effects of the Catholic bishops\u2019 ban on condoms."}
