{"text": "Feb 1,\u00a02013\nWomen carry HIV burden as infection rate set to rise \nBy MIKE MWANIKI mmwaniki@ke.nationmedia.com\nThe number of people living with Aids in Kenya is expected to rise from the current 1.6 million to 1.8 million in the next two years, a new report predicts.\nThe Kenya Aids Epidemic Update 2012 identified Nyanza province, which accounts for one in four people infected with HIV, as having the highest number of new HIV prevalence rates. \nIt is followed by Nairobi and then Coast. The report, which was released by the National Aids Control Council director Alloys Orago, also points out that more women than men were infected with HIV. \nBabies bear brunt\n\u201cWomen account for 59.1 per cent of adults living with HIV... among those aged between 15 to 49 years for example, HIV prevalence among women is at 8 per cent, which is nearly twice that among men at 4.3 per cent,\u201d said Prof Orago. \nAccording to the report, the high infection rates among women has led to an increase in the number of babies born with the virus.\nAbout 12,894 children were infected with HIV in 2011.\n\u201cVarious social factors such as gender inequality, sexual violence and an increase in stigma increase HIV risk and vulnerability,\u201d the director noted. \nAlthough HIV is most likely to affect young adults, the study adds, a considerable number of older people are living with HIV.\nIn 2008 and 2009, for example, roughly one out of 11 (9.1 per cent ) Kenyan men aged between 50 and 54 years were living with the virus.\nMore than 91,000 people were infected with HIV in 2011 and the director warned that each year, one in 200 adults are likely to get the virus. \nBut there is good news as the Nacc study notes that more people went to get tested to know their HIV status. \n\u201cMore than 5.7 million people were tested for HIV in various parts of the country,\u201d he revealed. Of more than 1.6 million people infected by HIV, over 110,000 are on the life-prolonging ARV drugs.\nIn a bid to reduce new HIV infections, Kenya has also scaled up voluntary male circumcision which reduces the risk of female-to-male HIV transmission by at least 60 per cent.\n\u201cMore than 230,000 males underwent voluntary medical circumcision,\u201d the report says."}
