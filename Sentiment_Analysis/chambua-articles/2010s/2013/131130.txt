{"text": "As Kenya joins the rest of the world in marking the World Aids Day on Sunday, there is growing concern about the rising HIV prevalence among young people. \nIt is a state of affairs that should be given due attention as it threatens to reverse remarkable gains made in the fight against HIV/Aids. \nA more complicated sub-plot to the statistics is that even among the vulnerable youth aged between the ages of 15-24 years, young women face a higher risk of infection, with the additional challenge of teenage pregnancy. \nExperts advance various reasons that expose young people to HIV, including inadequate access to contraceptives and information, and having multiple sex partners \u2014 particularly older men. \nSunday's events afford an opportune moment of reflection and subsequent action under the global banner of \u201cgetting to zero\u201d that seeks to prevent new infections. \nWhile various state agencies and non-governmental organisations should guard the gains made against the spread of the virus among the general population, there is the obvious need to design programmes that specifically meet the needs of young people. \nParticular attention should be paid to young women. Anything less is akin to gambling with the country\u2019s future.\u00a0 \nThis should include allowing young people easy access to contraceptives through youth friendly facilities, providing sex-related information and creating employment opportunities for young people \u2014 especially women \u2014 to avoid exploitation by older sex partners. \nThere is also a need to address other social challenges such as drug and alcohol abuse, which contribute to risky sexual behaviour especially among young people.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nThis, of course, is a complex problem with no quick fixes. However, it makes little sense to have policies and funds that support the youth to start businesses and win state tenders while ignoring a ticking health time bomb. \nThe worrying HIV prevalence among young people is not good for the country\u2019s development and must be checked urgently.
