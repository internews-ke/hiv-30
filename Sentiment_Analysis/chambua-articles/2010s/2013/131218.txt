{"text": "December 18,\u00a02013\nBe humane and end doctors' strike, people on ARVs urge government\nBy MAGDALENE WANJA\u2028More by this Author \nPeople living with Aids in Nakuru have urged the government to urgently intervene to end the on-going caregivers\u2019 strike.\nThey say they faced imminent death if they continued missing their anti-retroviral drugs (ARVs).\nSpeaking to the Nation at Nakuru\u2019s Comprehensive Care Clinic (CCC), they said a sudden stoppage of ARV treatment had already started showing a negative impact on them.\nSome were already developing festering wounds all over their bodies while others had become bedridden after suffering from diarrhoea.\n\u201cWe were told to continue using ARV drugs and attend medical check-ups religiously failure to which our health would deteriorate. \nWe have kept our part of the bargain but at the CCC there is no one to attend to us.\nIs the government serious in addressing the plight of poor, sick Kenyans?\u201d posed a beneficiary who declined to be named.\nCAMPING AT CLINIC\nThe patients who have been camping at the clinic for eight days said that their normal lives had been greatly disrupted.\nThe patients said they were too poor to afford the ARV drugs which they get free of charge at government hospitals.\nThey also risked buying the wrong drugs from local chemists, they added.\n\u201cEven then, who will write our prescription as all our medical files are locked in at the CCC? \nSomeone must be humane enough to end this suffering meted out on us and other terminally ill patients now spending their twilight days staring death in the face,\u201d said a concerned patient.\nSTAYING PUT\nMeanwhile, about twenty metres away from the CCC building, nurses, doctors and other medical professionals met to reiterate the resolve to stay put saying the strike would continue despite threats by county governments to have them fired for desertion of duty.\nAddressing the media, Regional Health Workers Union Secretary Julius Nyambega said that the county\u2019s plan to hire new health workers was unconstitutional since it would be denying workers their right to picket peacefully to demand for their rights."}
