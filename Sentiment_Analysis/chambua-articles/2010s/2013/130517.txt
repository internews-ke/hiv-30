{"text": "GET IT RIGHT I Laura A Young & Korir Sing'Oei\nHuman rights body erred by claiming\nThe report by the Kenya\nNational Commission\non Realising Sexual and\nReproductive Health Rights is\na milestone.\nHowever, the marmer in\nwhich the Commission has\naddressed two controversial\nissues - the rights of sexual\nminorities and rights of men\nand women who engage in sex\nwork - has done a disservice\nto both the communities.\nThe fact that the\nCommission links these two\nissues in its recent report,\nto the extent of labeling sex\nworkers as a sexual minority\ngroup and recommending\nlegalisation in both contexts,\nmisrepresents the human\nrights framework in relation to\nboth issues.\nFirst, the Commission\nconfuses the issue of\nwhat constitutes a sexual\nminority under international\nhuman rights principles by\nmentioning sex workers in\nthat chapter.\nSexual minorities are\nminorities based on immutable\ncharacteristics of sexual\norientation and gender\nidentity. The Yogyakarta\nPrinciples is the seminal\ninternational document\nthat addresses how human\nrights apply to those who\nare minorities based on their\nsexual orientation and gender\nidentity; that document\ndefines these terms in the\nfollowing manner.\nSex workers are not too eager to\npractise their business publicly\n\"Sexual orientation is\nunderstood to refer to each\nperson's capacity for profound\nemotional, affectional and\nsexual attraction to, and\nintimate and sexual relations\nwith, individuals of a different\ngender or the same gender or\nmore than one gender.\n\"Gender identity is\nunderstood to refer to each\nperson's deeply felt internal\nand individual experience of\ngender, which mayor may\nnot correspond with the sex\nassigned at birth, including\nthe personal sense of the\nbody (which may involve, if\nfreely chosen, modification of\nbodily appearance or function\nby medical, surgical or other\nmeans) and other exPressions\nof gender, including dress,\nspeech and mannerisms.\"\nNowhere do the Yogyarkarta\nPrinciples discuss the\napplication of the international\nhuman rights framework to\nsex workers. This is because\nsex workers are not a minority\nin any recognised international\nhuman rights framework.\nSex workers, indeed,\nsuffer discrimination and are\nmarginalised in society, but\nbeing a sex worker is not an\nimmutable characteristic in\nthe same category as gender\nidentity, race, or ethnicity. It\nis a livelihood, not an identity\nthat can never be altered.\nWhile the issues are clearly\nlinked, given that some GLBTI\nindividuals are forced to\nengage in sex work because\nthey are discriminated against\nin the professional sector\nand are thus unable to access\nother employment, declaring\nsex workers to be a sexual\nminority and linking them in\nthe way that the Commission's\nreport and the media have\ndone confound two completely\nseparate issues.\nSexual minorities deserve\nprotection from discrimination\nin all spheres of public life.\nSame sex couples should be\nable to engage in consensual\nsexual behaviour and carry out\nfulfilling personal relationships\nwithout fear of state sanction\nfor private behaviour.\nThe international\nhuman rights framework\nis clear on that and we\nlaud the Commission's\nrecommendation that samesex\nrelationships should be\ndecriminalised.\nSex workers also deserve\nprotection in all spheres of\npublic life, but not because\nthey are sexual minorities.\nThey deserve protection\nbecause they are human\nbeings with rights to be free\nfrom violence and exploitation.\nMany sex workers are\nheterosexual, a group\nthat does not constitute a\npersecuted minority. LGBTI\nindividuals are persecuted\nregardless of their profession.\nLinking decriminalisation\nof same-sex relationships and\nsex work, through labelling\nof both as sexual minorities\nundermines the understanding\nof minority rights and gives\nshort-shrift to the incredibly\ncomplex issue of addressing\nsex work.\nMoreover, linking the\nissues in the report has led\nto a media firestonn that\nperpetuates stereotypes\nthat all homosexuals are\nsex workers or that sexual\norientation and sex work are\nsomehow inextricably linked.\nThe Commission needs\nto continue to address the\nimportant concerns of sexual\nidentity, but it must do so in\na manner that addresses each\nissue on its own terms and\nthat reflects the international\nhuman rights framework.\nMs Young and Mr Sing'Oei are\ninternational human rights law\nattorneys."}
