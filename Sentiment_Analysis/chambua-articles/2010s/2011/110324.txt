Lack of\ntransport to clinics was also a problem\nthe ministry was grappling with in the\nfight against HIV/Aids, he said.\n\"Consequences of harbouring\ndrug-resistant virus strains include\ntreatment failure for affected patients\nand increased direct and indirect cost\nof healthcare,\" the Medical Services\nMinister said.\nProf Nyong'o, who also launched\nthe fourth edition of the therapy\nguidelines, said the ministry was\nstrengthening procurement and supply\nmanagement systems to minimise\ndrug resistance.\nThe document guides health\nworkers on the management of opportunistic\ninfections as well as chronic\nnon-communicable diseases.\nHe said the country was lucky to\nhave the Kenya Medical Research Institute\nand the Centers for Disease\nControl accredited by the World\nHealth Organisation to conduct research\non HIV drug resistance.\nThe forum comes against the backdrop\nof a study in Kenya and several\nAfrican countries linking increased\nHIV transmission to a popular birth\ncontrol drug, Depo Provera, which is\nthe subject of a high-level assessment\nby WHO. According to Dr Suzanne\nReier, a senior consultant with the\nworld body in Geneva, the organisation\nwas setting up a team of experts\nwho will assess all related studies and\nadvise on the drug's safety.\n\"This recent study has raised concerns\nacross the world and could\nhave devastating implications on\nfamily planning in the region;' said\nDr Reier. In Octoberj a study carried\nout by several local and international\nresearchers claimed the family planning\ndrug increased the risk of HIV\ntransmission and advised women to\nuse it together with condoms."}
