{"text": "Lobby questions law on Aids\nJillo Kadida\n15 February 2011\nA lobby is challenging the law criminalising deliberate transmission of HIV.\nThe organisation called the Aids Law Project bases its argument on this: a poor HIV positive mother has to breastfeed her child because she cannot afford baby food.\nThis woman, according to the non governmental organisation, would be liable for a Sh500,000 fine or imprisonment for up to seven years.\nFor this reason, the group says the law is discriminative and its implementation should be halted.\nThe organisation wants section 24 of the HIV and Aids Prevention and Control Act deleted, saying it puts the liberty of people infected with the virus in jeopardy.\nThe organisation accused the drafters of the law of failing to do a thorough job and as a result coming up with a discriminative piece of legislation.\nTo buttress its case, the organisation urged the court to compare the law to one proposed by Uganda which is yet to be enacted into law.\nThe Ugandan Bill says that each person is supposed to take reasonable precaution to protect himself and others against HIV.\nThe Aids Law Project is seeking an order to restrain the Attorney General and the Chief Public Prosecutor from enforcing the law, particularly the section in question.\nThe group says the law intrudes on the privacy of consensual sex between two adults because the apparatus of proof and methodology of prosecution is degrading.\nBut the Attorney General has opposed the case, saying the law's main aim is to guard the unsuspecting public.\nThe court will give its ruling on March 29."}
