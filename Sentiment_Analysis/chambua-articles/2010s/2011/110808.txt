{"text": "TECHNOLOGY\nQuick, cheap diagnostic test\nfor HIV and other infections\nAsmall plastic chip that costs\njust 10 (US) cents to make\ncan reliably diagnose HIV\nand syphilis within about 15 minutes.\nThe chip, which is based on microfluidics,\nuses small wafers that precisely\nmanipulate nanolitre volumes of fluid\nin order to carry out a sequence of\nchemical reactions.\nDeveloped by Samual Sia and collaborators\nat Columbia University,\nthe system was designed to be used\nin resource-poor settings. Field tests\nin Rwanda showed that the chip works\nas well as traditional laboratory-based\nHIV diagnostics. 8ia wants to deploy\nthe test in prenatal clinics in Africa.\nMany health clinics and even city\nhospitals in Africa must send out blood\nsamples to a national laboratory for\nprocessing, which can take days or\nweeks. But in poor, rural areas, where\npatients may have to travel days to\nreach a clinic, many people are unlikely\nto return for a second visit to get their\nresults. Tests that give reliable results\nin minutes could make a huge difference by letting the physician treat the\npatient during the visit.\nWhile rapid diagnostic tests for HIV\nand some other infections already\nexist, they are typically not used in\npoor areas of Africa because they are\nmore complicated to read and more\nexpensive to use. Such tests are limited\nto detecting a single disease per\nuse. With 8ia's chip, additional tests,\nsuch as for hepatitis or malaria, can be\nadded to the chip without increasing\nthe cost significantly.\nTo make microfluidics technology\nmore practical to use in poor countries,\n8ia's team designed it to be inexpensive\nto make and easy to read, and\nthen tailored manufacturing methods\nfor those purposes. The chips are produced\nvia a plastic injection moulding\nprocess that has been optimised to\ncreate nanoscale features. The reagents\nfor the detection reaction are stored in\na tube, separated by bubbles of air, and\nbrought into the chip with the simple\npull of a syringe.\nThe process requires no moving\nparts, electricity or external instrumentation,\nand it requires a very\nsmall amount of blood - about one\nmicrolitre. Unlike many microfluidics\ndevices, the results can be read without\nmicroscopes or other expensive optical\nsystems. A simple optical sensor\non an instrument that's about the size\nand cost of a cell phone gives the test\nresults.\nSia's team worked with Columbia's\nSchool of Public Health, the Rwandan\nadministrator of health and non-governmental\nhealth organisations to\ntest the device in Rwanda's capital\ncity of Kigali. As many as 8 per cent\nof women in Kigali are HIV positive,\nand it can take days or weeks to get\nthe results for HIV tests at the hospital\nbecause blood samples must be sent\nto an outside lab for analysis. When\nSia's device was used to test for HIV,\nand HIV and syphilis in combination,\nit detected 100 per cent of cases, with\na false-positive rate of about 4 per cent\nto 6 per cent - on par with standard\nlaboratory tests. The findings were\npublished last week in the journal\nNature Medicine.\nRecognising the challenge of raising\nfunds to commercialise a technology\nfor poor nations, Sia and two partners\nfounded a company called Claros Diagnostics.\nThey won venture funding\nto develop a device for use in doctors'\noffices in wealthy countries to monitor\nsigns of prostate cancer - a device\nthat garnered marketing approval in\nEurope in June. Sia's team at Colwnbia\nthen adapted the technology to test\nfor sexually transmitted diseases;\nin addition to HIV and syphilis and\nhepatitis, they are working on tests for\nhepatitis B and C, herpes and malaria.\nWhile the test was developed for use\nin poor countries, it might u1thnately\nfind appeal elsewhere as well.\n8ia's initial focus is on prenatal\nclinics. \"If you catch the diseases in\nmothers, you can prevent transmission\nto newborns, increasing clinical\nimpact:' 8ia says. According to the\nresearch, syphilis testing in mothers\nand pregnant women could reduce the\nnumber of years lost due to ill health,\ndisability or early death by 200,000\nin Rwanda.\nSia and his collaborators still face\na major hurdle: Finding funding to\ndevelop the 8m device into a commercial\nproduct. While the researchers\nwon grants and garnered venture-capital\nfunding to develop the technology,\nincluding money from the Gates Foundation\nto find the best market, they\nhave yet to secure funds to widely\nimplement the technology. Ironically,\nthe Gates Foundation declined\nto fund the next step in development,\nthough research showed that STD testing\nwas the opthna1 market to apply\nthe technology.\nThe New York Times Syndicate\nI"}
