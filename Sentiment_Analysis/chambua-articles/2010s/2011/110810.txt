{"text": "Lure of sex that leaves teenagers feeling empty\n\nTeenagers speak on the pull to premature sex and\nfrom their experiences it's a pitfall others would\nwish to avoid\nBY KINUTHIA MBURU\nliving@ke.nationmedia.com\nIt's common to hear teenagers\ntalk about 'hooking up' - a term\nthat often alludes to casual sex.\nThe average age of teenagers\nexperimenting with sex has been\n. declining steadily as children as\nyoung as 12 engage in sex, with\nsexually explicit materials more\nreadily available than ever before.\nYet, most teenagers do not\nseem to grasp the possible effects\nof premature sex. Part of\nthe problem seems to be lack of\ncommunication between parents\nand their teenagers on matters\nsexual, with teens feeling their\nopinions are neglected or ignored.\nWhy is this? What drives teenagers\ninto reckless sexual behaviour?\nAbstinence or safe sex: what\nwould teenagers rather practise?\nTo answer these questions, Living\nspoke to four teenagers on\nthe touchy subject of sex and\ndating. Here are their responses:\nMercy Muthoni, 18\n\"Giving in to sex is giving away\nyour dignity, and I have learned not\nto ever do it until such a time when\nI am mature and married. Sex is a\nline in which you can never go back\nto once you cross it. I do not have\na hoyfriend although I've been in a\nrelationship before. When I was 15,\na classmate asked me to be his girlfriend.\nAt first I thought it was odd.\nI was too young. But dating was common\nin our school and most of my\nclassmates had boyfriends and\ngirlfriends. In fact, some had even\n'cemented' their relationships by\nengaging in sex. It was a wonderful\nexperience, they said. I did\nnot intend to start a sexual relationship\nso early. But I thought it\nwould be nice and fun to have a\nguy put his arms around me, so I\nagreed to my classmate's proposal.\nBeing with my boyfriend became\nall that mattered although I knew\nmy parents would never approve\nof such a relationship. So I kept it\na top secret. It was easy, and looked\nlike fun. I would use devious code\nwords and nicknames to cover my\ntracks when talking to my boyfriend\nin my parents' presence. I knew\nthat premarital sex was wrong. But\nI had noone to turn to when my\nemotions overrode my thinking.\nDating gave me a rush of freedom.\nBut sex was different. It was a big\nlet-down. There was no feeling of\ngood or warmth as it was supposed\nto be. Rather, I started to feel dirty,\nempty and robbed of my innocence.\nI felt a profound sense of regret that\nI had given away my virginity, something\nI could never get back. My\nboyfriend had encouraged me that\nsex would bring us closer. At first\nI was very afraid, but he urged me\non. We had sex just after I turned 16.\nWe did It In his 'cube' (room). It was\nunprotected sex. No teenager would\nhave the courage to do\nit in his or her\nparents'\nhome.\nAnd because of lack of money, those\nwho engage in it usually do it in their\ncubes, or those of their friends. But\nthe truth is it ended our relationship.\nBut now all what that incident\nbrings to my mind is sheer regret.\nSex cannot be a factor if I started a\nrelationship now. It does not, alone,\nforge a permanent relationship. And\nif my boyfriend truly professes to\nlove me, then he should wait until we\nare married. But I feel every parent\nshould discuss sex with their teenage\nchildren and give guidance, and\nthe meaning of all the body changes\ntaking place during puberty, how to\nbehave in a relationship should they\nget into one, or wish to start one. I\nbelieve then we can prove to be more\nresponsible than we are perceived?'\nPaul Gachomo, 18\n\"The first time I heard sex discussed\nin detail was when I got\ncircwncised. It was embarrassing at\nfirst. I had never heard older people\nuse such strong sexual vocabulary.\nBut my caretaker assured me that\nit was a normal part of the boy-tom an\ntransition. The subject had\ncome up as a way of teaching me\nto be a responsible young adult and\nonly to engage in sex when I was\nmarried. But the advice I got from\nother boys and young men who had\nbeen circumcised earlier, and who\nfrequently visited me during the\nhealing period, was the complete\nopposite. Some would ask if I had\never had sex, whether I had a girlfriend\nand if I would have it after\ncoming out of the house (healing).\n\"Every newly circumcised boy\nhad to clean himself off the 'soot'\nthat came with circumcision,'\" they\nsaid. In other words, they\nWere encouraging young. But dating was common\nin our school and most of my\nclassmates had boyfriends and\ngirlfriends.

When I was 15,\na classmate asked me to be his girlfriend.\nAt first I thought it was odd.\nI was too me to engage in pre-marital sex. So\nI healed with a stirred curiosity. Due\nto peer pressure, I wanted to clean\nmyself and really become a man. I\ngot a girlfriend with the sole mission\nof sleeping with her. At first, she resisted,\nbut I finally managed to take\nher to my room. My parents were not\nat home, but although we were not\ncaught, I did not know how to deal\nwith the feelings of guilt and embarrassment\nthat came with it, and for\na long time. Looking back, I don't\nsee how that experience made me a\nman. Rather, I feel bad that I gave\naway my virginity and innocence for\nnothing. The sad thing is that it was\nunprotected sex 'in order to remove\nthe soot'. Anything could have happened\nto me -Impregnating the girl\nor worse still contracting diseases.\nGiven a second chance, I wouldn't\ndo it until much later. But since I\ncannot take it back, the wise thing\nis to forge ahead on a clean sheet.\nMatthew Maina, 17\n\"I am in Form. Two, and I have a\ngirlfriend in the same class, but in a\ndifferent school. We are neighbours\nat home, and have been dating for\nthe past three months. We usually\nmeet on Sundays. However,\nwe do not get 'very intimate' as\nthat would sell us out as being\nimmoral. So our relationship is\nmostly sustained through borrowing\nand lending each other movies\nand books. That way, we are able\nto keep our parents' antennae at\nbay. We wouldn't want them to\nknow as they would dismiss us as\ntoo young to be in a relationship.\nI believe this relationship will\nlast long since we love each other.\nWe have not engaged in sex, and I\nsometimes feel pressured to experiment,\nand often wonder if it's\nreally that bad. Some\nof my peers at school have already done it.\nThis makes me feel odd, especially\nwhen they relive their\n'experiences and fantasies'. After\nevery weekend, you are sure\nto hear about the latest hook\nup, who's Chat' and who's not.\nHook-ups mostly thrive during\nschool holidays when we have a\nchance to meet our girlfriends.\nAt times, I've been overwhelmed\nwith curiosity, and the\nfear of possible repercussions.\nIt is like walking a tightrope.\nWhat if I contracted a disease\nor impregnated my girlfriend.\nWhat would my parents say?\nHow would they react? Of\ncourse there is the option of\ncondoms and contraceptive\npills. The emergency pill is\nvery popular, but I'd rather my\ngirlfriend and I abstained. You\ncan never be too sure; something\ncan happen, you know!\nI wish I could have someone\nolder to share my feelings with.\nPerhaps, it would be easier. Yet I\ncan't bring up such a topic with\nmy parents. It is too shameful,\nand I would rather talk to my\nfriends. I am not sure my parents\nwould understand either.\nBut although my parents have\nnever talked about sex with\nme, I know where they stand .\nand what their expectations of\nme are - to abstain from both\nsex and dating until I complete\nschool. So far, I am glad I have\nbeen able to control my emotions\nand desires. I think the\ninclination and the pressure to\nhave sex is just a normal part\nof growing up. Somewhat, eve-\nExpert views\nKen P. Munyua, a counsellin9\npsychologist at Maranatha\nCounselling Centre, attributes\nthe surge in sexual cases\namong teenagers to curiosity\nand lack of information.\n\"Their curiosity and peer\npressure serve as perfect\nbreeding ground for illicit\nsexual behaviours as they\nalways have myths and facts\nabout sex. Young people\ntoday, unlike the yester years,\nare more exposed to sexual\nmatters and hence, they\nalready know 'everything'\nexcept the act.\"\nHowever, it is not all lost as\nparents and society can do\nMuch to rope straying teenagers\nBack in. \"The only way\nTeenagers already indulging\nIn sex can stop is by finding\nAlternative ways of spending\nTheir leisure time, and systematically\nStopping in case\nOf addictive behavior.\"\nHe advises parents to \"be\nthe ones to tell all to their\nchildren and when they are\nunable and, or uncomfortable\nto, they should get them\nmentors who will help to educate\nthem. let us educate our\nrybody feels this way. After all,\nit is only natural to want to feel\nloved. But there are limits, is all\nI can advise fellow teenagers!'\nKallen Wanjiru, 19\n\"I went through high school\nseeing school-mates having\nboyfriends and girlfriends. And\nthough I never considered pairing,\nI often allowed myself to\nfantasise about the boys I liked.\nThis heightened my desire to\nhook up. But after talking to my\nmother, she sat me down and\ntold me that sex would end in\ndisappointment and heartache.\nI am happy I'm pulling it off.\nBut it is not easy. When you are\ninexperienced, you think that\nyour peers' lifestyle is exciting.\nBut if you look below the\nsurface, their behaviours will\noften rub off on you if you are\nnot careful. I have seen teens\nas young as 13 pairing. It's all\nabout natural attraction to the\nopposite sex and peer pressure.\nStill, hooking up is about two\npeople giving in to their physical\ndesires. I have chosen to\nabstain. But even though it is\ncool to chill [abstain] there are\nmany teenagers who continue\nto engage in reckless sexual\nbehaviours, oblivious of the\ndangers. Most do not accept\nthat they are dating. Instead,\nthey talk of having 'friends\nwith benefits' - with whom sex\ncan be practised without any\n'emotional strings' attached.\nI have friends who started\noff innocently; with a simple\nhug, then a peck on the cheek.\nyoung people on the effects\nof sex so as to make them\nmore aware. let us be their\nsource of information.\"\nBut how should they deal\nwith peer pressure? According\nto Children and Youth\nPsychologist, Timothy Mukua,\nteens with a strong identity\nmay not have challenges\ndealing with peer pressure.\nThe key issues, he says, are\nawareness and choice. When\nteens are aware of the kind of\npressure they are exposed to,\nthey are more able to choose\ntheir path in life, the company\nthey keep and about relationships,\nhow to spend time and\nthe kind of beliefs, altitudes\nand behaviours to display.\nHe advises parents to be a\nlittle concerned about the\nkind of friends their teens\nhang out with, but \"they\nshould not come too hard on\nthem\". They can have them\ngo through life-skills lessons.\nThis should foster their\nunderstanding of identity.\n\"There is also a need for\npeer-based activities and\noutings to harness positive\npeer influence, even to teen-\nMost thought no, it can't\nhappen; we won't go 'all the\nway'. And before they knew'\nit, they were engaging in sex.\nIt is difficult for a teenager\nto open up to parents. I faced\nsuch emotional difficulties\nwhen I decided to confide in\nmy mother. I was worried about\nher reaction should she get to\nknow I was dating. I feared that\nmom would rebuke me, and discipline\nme, and insist that I was\nstill too young to get into a relationship.\nBut she sat me down\nand calmly explained what it\nmeant to have a boyfriend, the\nconsequences of a rushed, immature\nrelationship. She told\nme how unwanted pregnancies\nand STIs could result from such\nrelationships. She advised that\nI first concentrate on school,\ngiven that I wasn't prepared for\nlife, marriage or motherhood.\nTeenage dating is a fact that\nour parents must try to accept.\nSometimes, they come\ntoo hard on us, yet all we are\nlooking for is a shoulder to lean\non. And it's not just about sex.\nWe face a lot of challenges like\nunexplained feelings and emotions\nthat we didn't experience\nbefore, pressure from teachers\nand peers, influence from\nmovies, TV and music, in our\nteens, most of which we cannot\nhandle alone. Also, our seniors\nshould set a good example. It\ndoes not help to see them getting\nintimate in our presence.\nRather it whets our curiosities\nto try our own dating games.\""}
