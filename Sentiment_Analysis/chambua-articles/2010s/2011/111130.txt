{"text": "November 30,\u00a02011\nWoman\u2019s battle with HIV since childhood \nBy ANTHONY NYONGESA anyongesa@ke.nationmedia.com\nA world free of Aids is what Dorcas Kawira wants to see, and with good reason: she has lived with HIV all her life.\nAs the world marks Aids Day on Thursday, her wish is that the infected and affected are reached for support.\nMs Kawira, a 20-year-old first year student at Moi University in Eldoret moved people to tears when she took to the stage to talk about her status. \nShe was born with the virus, and lost her parents at the tender age of six. Together with her younger brother, they had to rely on well-wishers for upkeep and education.\n\u201cHIV is with all of us because even if we are not infected, we are affected in one way or the other. So we need to treat the victims with compassion,\u201d said Ms Kawira, who joined the university\u2019s Annex campus a few months ago after scoring a clear A in the 2009 KCSE examinations.\nShe said: \u201cMany students in schools and colleges fear the HIV stigma, and therefore a number of them have opted to remain silent rather than go public. The government and other institutions need to look at ways of reaching such youth instead of dwelling on boardroom meetings as the virus spreads,\u201d Ms Kawira said during Unesco\u2019s reproductive and HIV Youth Seminar at the Serena Hotel on Wednesday.\nExuding confidence, she swore to conquer the virus she has lived with for two decades. And Ms Kawira, who was born in Nanyuki where her parents worked, says she wants to be admitted to the bar in five years so she champions the rights of people with HIV.\nWiped tears\nEven as the audience wiped tears away, avoiding to meet her eyes, the girl who says she is ready to traverse parts of the country to talk to the youth, says parents and teachers need to be at the forefront of talking about HIV freely to pupils and students. \n\u201cThe education system needs to acknowledge this reality and develop a curriculum that incorporates sex education and reproductive health,\u201d said Ms Kawira whose main challenge while in school was getting and using anti-retroviral drugs.\nShe says the youth need to be taught, not just safe sex, but also use of ARV drugs and their effects. \n\u201cSome of the infected students in secondary schools and colleges abandon medicine immediately they are admitted. School heads and teachers need to be taught how to deal with students whose status has been revealed,\u201d she said, adding that she had a hard time in secondary school because of illness and absenteeism.\n\u201cTeachers lectured me and demanded explanation as to why I was absent. That meant I had to tell them the nature of my illness which was painful,\u201d she said.\nMs Kawira said children with HIV had a right to education and a healthy life, adding that while the physical, mental and psychological struggle was hard to bear, it was possible to overcome.\nShe recommends that the ministry protects children living with the virus in schools, as well as train teachers on the basics of supporting such children.\nSo, does she have a boyfriend? She smiles: \u201cNo. I don\u2019t have a boyfriend. I have several friends. I don\u2019t want to get committed to someone and then end up breaking his heart after he learns of my medical status. But I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get one one day, God willing.\u201d. \nListening to her leaves one marvelling about her strength and boldness. She says she cried until her tears are no more. \n\u201cWhat is the point of crying, anyway? HIV is now manageable, and what people need is to accept their condition. Everyone including the media need to be supportive in this battle,\u201d said Ms Kawira whose name in her Meru tribe means \u201chard-working\u201d.\n\u201cI\u2019m now working hard to change the attitude of people towards HIV and Aids,\u201d Ms Kawira said.\nShe wants those involved in HIV and Aids prevention and cure not to look down upon those infected. \n\u201cWhat comes in mind whenever HIV/Aids is mentioned is sexual activities. It should be known that there are several causes including the mother-to-child transmission, which is the case that happened to me,\u201d she said, adding that she will not die soon. \n\u201cTo win the war against HIV, we just need to open up. We need to talk openly just as we do about flu or headache,\u201d she said as the event coordinator Jane Kamau who is in charge of HIV unit at Unesco picked her to talk to another group of people anxiously waiting for her."}
