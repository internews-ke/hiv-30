UNDP will use the funds to strengthen its activities in the country.\n\u201cWe are pleased with this partnership. It will enable UNDP scale-up implementation of programmes at a vital phase in Kenya\u2019s history as they implement the Constitution and go through the first general election under the new law,\u201d said the UNDP resident representative Aeneas Chuma during the signing ceremony.\nThe 2009- 2013 CPAP outlines UNDP\u2019s role in supporting the government\u2019s efforts to \u201ccreate and sustain an enabling environment for human development.\u201d\nKey areas that the United Nation\u2019s arm supports are promoting investment opportunities, empowerment, security (from HIV/Aids, natural and man-made disasters), sustainability and strategic outreach.\nThis involves helping the government to enable expanded opportunities to its poor by facilitating a conducive environment for job creation, to enhance the empowerment of Kenyans through effective participation in decision-making, helping Kenya to guarantee better levels of security to locals and ensuring the long-term sustainability of the country. \nTo achieve this, UNDP works with partners to implement programmes in democratic governance, poverty reduction, peace building and conflict prevention, energy environment and climate change, disaster risk reduction as well as policy advisory.\nThe mission of the United Nations System in Kenya is to support the government in its efforts to create and sustain an enabling environment for the promotion of human rights, good governance and the improvement of the quality of life and the well-being of the people of Kenya. The UNDP established in Kenya in November 1964 is an arm of the United Nations. "}
