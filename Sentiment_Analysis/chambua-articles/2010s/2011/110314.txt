{"text": "Thank God they are pulling\nHIV/Aids off the pedestal\nSome of the attention and funding\nHIV gets needs to be diverted into the general health care systems.\nRelentless and deliberate promotion of HIV as different from other diseases only enforces stigma, and I am glad that the Ministry of Health is taking steps to correct this mistake.\nThe most unfortunate and uncomfortable truth is that, while HIV is a dangerous disease, too much attention is being focused on it at the expense of other very deadly infections\n\nI politely told him that the  next time he is in the bathtub, he should take an iron-box connected to a socket with him, and that he should consider it a form of do-it-yourself electro-convulsive therapy.\nElectro-convulsive therapy was used in the past to treat madness, and I was convinced that the person I was dealing with had gone bonkers. That form of treatment is no longer used because it is considered extreme. But this character was a special nutcase and, therefore, I recommended two iron boxes, just to be on the safe side.\nWhy? He had made the unpardonable claim that HI/Aids was sent to us by God to punish an immoral world.\nPerhaps he thinks that anti-retrovirals are the work of scientists in league will the devil. Or that HIV sufferers are reaping the rewards of their iniquities.\nThose unfortunate enough to be born with the virus probably got it due to the doctrlne of original sin.\nHe belonged to a particularly pernicious strain of Christianity that was especially obsessed wilb eschatological\nprouncements. And, worse, I later found out that he wasn't alone; an American cardinal also expressed misgivings about searching for a cure for Aids claiming that it would lead to an increase in immorality.\nWe have, I believe, lost our heads when it comes to HIV. The condition is now hailed - I prefer \"commiserated\"\n- as a national disaster, the greatest scourge humanity faces, and the  fourth horseman of the  apocalypse, for those of you with an esoteric revelation of some ancient religious text.\nThe most unfortunate and uncomfortable truth is that, while HIV is a  dangerous and disease, too much attention is being focused on it at the expense of other more dangerous diseases. Kevin M. de Cock, the head of theWorld Healt Organisation's department of HIV/Aids, has been quoted as saying that HIVprevalence is actually reducing.\nThat is why I was encouraged to read in the papers last week that HIV is going to lose its special status and be treated like any other normal\nFILE I NATION\nSome of the attention and funding\nHIV gets needs to be diverted into\nthe general health care systems.\nRelentless and deliberate promotion\nof HIV as different from other\ndiseases only enforces stigma.\nand I am glad that the Ministry of\nHealth is taking steps to correct this mistake.\nWe have put it on a pedestal for too long HIV even has\nits own agency in the UN, separate from the World Health Organisation, and various funds to combat it -like\nthe World Bank and the United States President's Emergency funds.\nThe Aids industry is now a booming economy, and one blogger hit home when he said that \"more people make\na living from it than actually die from it':\nMy friend Bernard Aketch even described contracting HIV as a \"great career move that opens doors to guestspeak in international venues about living positively with the virus in Africa\".\nI am not, in any way, demeaning the seriousness of the disease, but I think it has been milked and exploited for alternative ends for too long.\nKenya even enacted the most lumpen piece of legislature \u2013 criminalizing the intentional transmission of HIV. That law has nothing to do with protecting uninfected people or starters, with current advances in medical knowledge, HIV is not\na death sentence; it's a manageable chronic illness.\nCriminalisation of the disease will only make people reluctant to get tested. Plus, with its multiple strains and modes of entry, it is difficult to prove how the virus was transmitted from one person to the other. Besides, when one agrees to have sex, the risk is\nto both parties, and the  incentive to use prophylactics falls on both parties, not just the one without the disease.\nWhat 0therdisease is held up to this absurd law, a piece of legislation that is hard to prove and near-impossible to implement? People living with HIV are not vectors looking to spread the disease. Why don't we also enact a law on the malicious spreading of Ebola, an even more dangerous disease?\nThe law, I believe, has nothing to\ndo with public health, but a lot to do\nwith sexual morality. This war-against Aids\nlegislation is a moral crusade\nagainst certain high-risk groups like\nprostitutes, a bid to police public\nbehaviour.\nIn Africa, most of the aid earmarked\nfor HIV comes with dastardly preconditions,\nlike insisting on abstinence-only\nmethods. Abstinence does not work; it\nhas failed spectacularly in the US and\nin Uganda. In Kenya, the \"Nimechill\"\nadverts promoting abstinence are back\nin our faces again after a break.\nLast week, the adverts, which seek\nto present abstinence as cool and show\nteenagers dancing to a video mix of\nsongs, had Missy Elliott's Get Your\nFreak On playing in the background,\nand all the while telling the kids to\nkeep it chilled. I didn't know they had\nalso budgeted for sarcasm.\nAbstinence is only a short-term\nthing. It ends. Then what? Because\nwhen they get into committed relationships,\nthey start having unprotected\nsex. I prefer the \"Nakufeel\" ad that\nadvocates for condom use since it is\nmore sensible.\nMalaria is a bigger killer than Aids,\nbut, unfortunately, it does not give have\npeople dishing out aid the moral high\nground to lecture and pontificate on\npersonal behaviour while spreading\nethical agendas.\nWhich is where the Catholic Church\ncomes in. The church is ready to help\nall those who get the virus, but refuses\nto prescribe condoms to these people\nbefore they contract the virus in the\nfirst place.\nSome of the attention and funding\nHIV gets needs to be diverted into the\ngeneral health care systems. Relentless\nand deliberate promotion of\nHIV as different from other\ndiseases only enforces\nstigma, and I am glad that\nthe  Ministry of Health is\ntaking steps to correct\nthis mistake.\nAids is manageable,\nyet, more than ever,\nit is still treated like a\ndeath sentence, a sort of\nfirs possibly-mare-prevalent diseases.\nContinuously advocating\na single health\nissue ignores other\nmore equally dangerous\ndiseases.\nwaga\nodongo"}
