{"text": "August 2,\u00a02011\nWho would have thought this virus would be a gift? \nToday, I celebrate two birthdays: 46 years of life, and 25 years of living with HIV. It was on my birthday that I was told I was HIV positive. I look back with thanksgiving to God, who in His awesome mightiness has granted me long life. \nLooking back, I cannot believe it is that long since I miserably walked out of the principal\u2019s office, who, in a wrap-up manner, informed me that I had six months to live because I was HIV-infected.\nI still wonder what her calculations were based on, but as things are, she was totally wrong, because God\u2019s way of crunching numbers defies human ability. \nOn arrival home after that crushing revelation, things got worse. I was the girl who hadn\u2019t got pregnant while all her schoolmates had dropped out of school because pregnancy.\nI was the girl who was top in CPE, and who had joined a good government secondary school, and then medical school to become a doctor (in the village, there is little difference between a doctor and a nurse). \nTherefore, when I made my way home carrying AIDS and a six months death sentence, the news travelled like wildfire in the harmattan.\nMany came to watch me die. They crowded our compound, and talked in low tones, as if the monster would attack them if they raised their voices.\nSome would talk to my mum over the fence, and would say something like, \u201cOh, how are you? Is she still there? Be strong my sister, as you wait for the day.\u201d \nThis was her comfort, not my comfort. It was not hard to read between the lines, that the sooner I died the better, because it would save everyone the embarrassment. \nMost of all, I pitied my mum who, despite how she reacted to my HIV status, had to undergo this. I cursed everyone, including God. Why had He allowed things to take this course? And why did I have to wait for six months of hell to die?\nFor the millionth time I asked, \u201cWhy me, God?\u201d And why did He not take my life in a more secretive and dignified way, instead of doing it with me inside a fishbowl? \nI vowed never to pray again. It didn\u2019t matter whether I went to hell or heaven, all I wanted was to get out of my hellish existence. \nDays turned into weeks and weeks into months, and the years came and went, and now it\u2019s 25 years after that death pronouncement. Now I believe that God was taking me through a tough course and refining me so that I could head His mission of helping those who found themselves in similar situations, without judgement or prejudice.\nWhenever I\u2019m working, which is always amongst people with HIV, I always remember my own situation; how I would\u2019ve liked to be treated, how I would\u2019ve liked to be listened to, how I would\u2019ve liked someone to just wipe away my tears, to hold me, even without the sometimes perfunctory pronouncements like, \u201cI know what you\u2019re going through\u201d. \nYes, I cried for endless nights until I could cry no more. I cried for a career that I knew I would never have, a family I would never have. \nYet God, in His own mysterious way, would give all these to me: but at the right time and for the right purpose. His time, not mine, is always the best.\nWhen I thought this virus only belonged to others, He taught me that we are all His children, created in His own image, and that He does not discriminate. \nWhere I was asked, \u201cWhy me?\u201d I learnt to say, \u201cWhy not me?\u201d And not only as far as misfortune or disease are concerned, but even in good timed.\nThat is, if others can have a good life, why not me? If others with worse conditions can live, why not me? If others can live comfortably, why not me? If others can leave indelible footprints on earth, why not me? \nGod has given me things I thought I would never have. If, 25 years ago someone had prophesied all this to me, I would\u2019ve told them to go and see a shrink. I have found love, and happiness, and family, and sexiness, and laughter, and longevity, and touched many lives, and..\nAnd if He can do it in my life, He can do it in yours. \nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother of three who tested HIV-positive 25 years ago.
