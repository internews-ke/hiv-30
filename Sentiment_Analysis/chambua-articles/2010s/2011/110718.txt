{"text": "May 18,\u00a02011\nStrauss-Kahn accuser may be HIV infected, says paper\nNEW YORK, Wednesday\nIMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn\u2019s alleged sex-assault victim lives in an apartment rented exclusively for adults with HIV or Aids, The New York Post reported today.\nThe hotel maid, a West African immigrant, has occupied the fourth-floor High Bridge pad with her 15-year-old daughter since January \u2014 and before that, lived in another Bronx apartment set aside by Harlem Community Aids United strictly for adults with the virus and their families.\nThe Post has not been able to ascertain whether the maid, 32, has HIV/Aids because of medical confidentiality laws.\nBut the agency rents apartments only for adults with the disease. A Harlem United worker said at least one adult in the household has to be HIV-positive or have Aids to qualify for one of their units. A healthy adult with a child with HIV or Aids is not eligible.\nThe maid had previously lived in another High Bridge apartment rented by Harlem United, a source said. She had moved there with her child in 2008.\u2028Meanwhile, a group that defends women\u2019s rights in global financial institution programmes has called for the resignation of Mr Strauss-Kahn.\nWashington-based Gender Action said the International Monetary Fund \u201cneeds new leadership\u201d whatever the outcome of Strauss-Kahn\u2019s case, which awaits a New York grand jury\u2019s assessment of the evidence for trial.\n\u201cStrauss-Kahn\u2019s arrest and the growing body of allegations of sexual misconduct against him mandate an expeditious move to new leadership at the IMF,\u201d said Elaine Zuckerman, the president of the group, which monitors the work of the IMF, World Bank and other international financial institutions.\u2028\u201cStrauss-Kahn\u2019s continued leadership of the IMF is untenable,\u201d she said in a statement.
