They roughed him up then the police rescued and whisked him away to the police station.\nThe Teachers Service Commission said it would strike the teacher off their register if found guilty, according to spokesperson Nkatha Murungi.\nMr Murungi said the defiled girls were taken to hospital for medical treatment to prevent possible infection with the virus.\nMore than 600 teachers are facing disciplinary cases related to sexual harassment against school girls.\nMr Anampiu appealed to parents to take take their children to credible institutions where their safety would be guaranteed.\nThe Kenya National Union of Teachers condemned the act and asked its members to desist from such behaviour.\n\u201cThe union will not condone unprofessional behaviour and if the allegation is true, let the law take its course,\u201d acting secretary general David Okuta said.\nThe incident occurred last Friday.
