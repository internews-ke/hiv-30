{"text": "March 23,\u00a02011\nTop actress Elizabeth Taylor dies \nLOS ANGELES, Wednesday\nLegendary Hollywood actress and violet-eyed beauty Elizabeth Taylor, who captured hearts in \u201cNational Velvet\u201d to launch a film career that spanned five decades, died on Wednesday aged 79.\nTaylor had been in Los Angeles\u2019 Cedars-Sinai hospital for six weeks with congestive heart failure, a condition with which she had struggled for some years and had recently suffered complications, a family statement said.\n\u201cShe was surrounded by her children: Michael Wilding, Christopher Wilding, Liza Todd, and Maria Burton,\u201d it said, noting that Taylor, who married eight times, was survived by 10 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.\n\u201cMy Mother was an extraordinary woman who lived life to the fullest, with great passion, humour, and love,\u201d Michael Wilding said.\n\u201cThough her loss is devastating to those of us who held her so close and so dear, we will always be inspired by her enduring contribution to our world.\u201d\nTaylor won two Academy Awards for best actress, including in the 1966 classic \u201cWho\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\u201d one of many films she played opposite Richard Burton.\nBurton was one of the great loves of Taylor\u2019s life -- she married and divorced him twice -- but her stormy relationships off-screen often overshadowed her glittering film career.\nIn later years as her health failed she retired from the public gaze, although she notably attended the 2009 funeral of her long-time friend Michael Jackson, while she remained active in raising funds to battle AIDS/HIV.\nBorn in London February 27, 1932, she was evacuated to California with her American parents in 1939, where she was soon discovered at her father\u2019s art gallery by the fianc\u00e9e of the chairman of Universal Studios.\nShe debuted in 1942 in \u201cThere\u2019s One Born Every Minute,\u201d and by 1944 had become a child star with \u201cNational Velvet,\u201d the story of a girl who rides her horse to victory at the Grand National disguised as a boy.\nShe married for the first time in 1950, aged 18, to playboy hotel chain heir Nicky Hilton. The marriage lasted 203 days, collapsing amid verbal and physical abuse after a lavish Hollywood wedding and a three-month European honeymoon.\nTaylor moved on, and by 1952 she had tied the knot with British matinee idol Michael Wilding, 19 years her senior. They had two children, Michael Jr and Christopher.\nThough Taylor said Wilding gave her stability, it wasn\u2019t enough. She filed for divorce in 1956, and within days of the separation producer Michael Todd, 49, proposed.\nTough and domineering, he was Taylor\u2019s first great love. They had a daughter, Elizabeth Frances, in August 1957, but seven months later tragedy struck: Todd was killed in a plane crash in New Mexico.\nDevastated, Taylor was accompanied at Todd\u2019s funeral by his best friend, singer Eddie Fisher -- with whom she launched an affair, and married in 1959.\nShe won her first Oscar for best actress in 1960 for her portrayal of a high-class call girl in \u201cButterfield 8.\u201d Taylor is said to have hated the movie.\nThen came \u201cCleopatra\u201d (1962) -- \u201csurely the most bizarre piece of entertainment ever perpetrated,\u201d on the set of which she met Burton.\nThey married in March 1964 in Montreal. By the time they were filming \u201cWho\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf,\u201d the harrowing portrayal of a marriage torn by booze, bitterness and failure mirrored their own.\nThey divorced in June, 1974 and remarried in October of the following year in Botswana, only to divorce again in August, 1976.\nThe marriage left Taylor an alcoholic, and her career in decline. A seventh marriage to Virginia senator John Warner, from 1976 to 1982, failed to cure the blues.\nIn and out of California\u2019s Betty Ford Clinic in the 1980s, she overcame her alcoholism and a dependence on painkillers and emerged as a champion in the cause of AIDS victims.\nIn 1991, she stunned the world by marrying husband No. 8: Larry Fortensky, a 40-year-old construction worker she met in rehab. They parted amicably three years later.\nHer son Michael said Wednesday: \u201cWe know, quite simply, that the world is a better place for Mom having lived in it. Her legacy will never fade, her spirit will always be with us, and her love will live forever in our hearts.\u201d"}
