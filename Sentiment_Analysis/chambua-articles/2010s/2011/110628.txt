{"text": "June 28,\u00a02011\nHIV drugs \u2018that cause premature aging\u2019 named \nBy GATONYE GATHURA gathura@ke.nationmedia.com\nA class of HIV drugs common in Kenya has been found to cause premature aging and hasten heart and brain disorders.\nThis finding comes as Kenya is struggling to replace Stavudine, a drug belonging to the same class, with less toxic HIV medicines following World Health Organisation recommendations.\nStudies have shown that Stavudine causes side effects that include lipodystrophy or loss of body fat and a nerve disorder that leads to numbness and burning pain.\nThese types of drugs - sometimes called \u201cnukes\u201d - were the first class of medicines available for the treatment of HIV around 1987.\nBecause of the many side effects associated with them, they are no longer used in rich countries but form an important treatment option in Kenya and other poor countries.\nThe findings, published on Sunday, explain why some people on anti-retroviral drugs show advanced signs of frailty and age-associated illnesses such as cardiovascular disease and dementia at an early age.\nThe most common of this class of drugs is Zidovudine or AZT, which locally goes by the brand name Retrovir.\nIts patent licence has expired and cheaper copies are available to countries like Kenya which are struggling to provide ARVs to all in need.\nAbout 460,000 Kenyans are on ARVs, according to Special Programmes minister Esther Murugi.\nA statement by the University of Newcastle, which was part of the study, says even among people who change to a different medication, the damage has been seen to continue.\n\u201cHIV clinics were seeing patients who had otherwise been successfully treated but who showed signs of being much older than their years. This was a real mystery,\u201d says lead researcher Patrick Chinnery.\nProf Chinnery says these patients had similarities with people suffering from conditions that affect energy production in human cells \u2014 mitochondrial diseases.\nIt has now been established that these \u201cnukes\u201d attack the \u201cbatteries\u201d that provide cells with energy to carry out their functions.\n\u201cWhat is surprising, though, is that patients who came off the medication many years ago may still be vulnerable to these changes,\u201d the researchers say.\nThe research team is now looking at ways to repair or stall some of the damage caused by the medication and believe exercise may help."}
