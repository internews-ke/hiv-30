We are not doing that at all. \n\u201cWhat we are saying is that we are members of the Commonwealth and we aspire to adhere to universal rights and part of those rights is protecting interests of minorities.\u201d\nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron has been roundly condemned by African countries \u2014 Zambia, Tanzania, Uganda and Ghana \u2014 over threats a fortnight ago that his Government would cut aid to developing countries that would not enact pro-homosexual laws. \nMr Bellingham said Mr Cameron did not say the UK would cut aid to any particular country in Africa over gay rights. (READ: UK to reduce aid to Africa's anti-gay regimes)\n\u201cWhat he did say is that we do oversee where we have a big aid programme, it does give us the right to talk to Governments not to persecute minorities be they religious, disabled or gay,\u201d said Mr Bellingham.\nHe said Mr Cameron had countries like Malawi in mind where there was \u201cvery extreme persecution of gays\u201d. Mr Cameron \u201cdid not say that we will be tying aid\u201d to gay rights, he said.\nThe UK will \u201calways be sensitive to local traditions\u201d, said Mr Bellingham, and \u201cwe are not one of those countries that lecture to others\u201d. \nOn the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis\u2019 impact on Africa, Mr Bellingham said the UK was \u201cvery concerned\u201d about the economic problems in Europe because 40 per cent of its trade was with the Eurozone member countries.\n\u201cWe want these Europe zone countries to have their economies move forward and not decline because a lot of African goods are exported into Europe and a lot of European companies are investing in Africa,\u201d Mr Bellingham said. \n\u201cIf you have a stronger economy; it\u2019s good for trade and investment but if you have an economy that is declining then demand is reducing and investment is going to decline as well.\u201d"}
