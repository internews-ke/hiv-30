{"text": "Early HIV therapy\nprotects partners\nfrom deadly virus\nStudy carried in numerous countries,\nincIuding Kenya, confirms a belief held\nby many scientists and physicians - that\nstarting drug therapy early can help to\nlimit rates of transmission of the virus that\ncauses Aids\nPeople with HIV can reduce\nhe risk of infecting their\nsex partners by more than\n90 per cent if they start treatment\nwith antiretroviral drugs when their\nimmune system is still relatively\nhealthy, researchers announced\nlast week.\nThe study, which included 1,763\nmostly heterosexual couples from\nnine countries, was supposed to\nlast until 2015, but the results\nwere released early because of the\nsignificance of the findings. The\nresearch confirmed a belief held\nby many scientists and physicians\n- that starting drug therapy early\ncan help to limit rates of transmission\nof the virus that causes Aids.\n'We set out to prove that if you\ntook earlier therapy you could\nbenefit your own health and you\ncould prevent the transmission of\nHN,' said lead researcher Dr Myron\nCohen, director of the Institute for\nGlobal Health and Infectious Diseases\nat the University of North\nCarolina at Chapel Hill\n\"Both of those hypotheses were\nrealised,\" he said.\nThe study, which started in 2005,\nrandomly assigned the couples to\ntwo treatment groups: In the first\ngroup the HIV-infected individual\nbegan taking a combination of three\nantiretroviral drugs inunediately. In\nthe second group, the HIV-positive\nperson delayed drug therapy until\ntheir CD4 T-cell count - a blood\ntest that measures immune system\nhealth - either dropped below 250\nor an Aids-related illness (such as\npneumocystis pneumonia) set in.\nBoth groups also received HIV\ncare, which included counselling on\nsafe sex, free condoms, treatment\nfor sexually transmitted infections,\nregular HIV testing and evaluation,\nand treatment for any HIV-related\ncomplications.\nThe trial was conducted at 13\nsites in nine countries including\nthe United States, Botswana, Brazil,\nIndia, Kenya, Malawi, South Africa,\nThailand and Zimbabwe.\nIn looking over the preliminary\nfindings, the data and safety monitoring\nboard shepherding the study\nidentified 39 new cases of HIV\namong the previously uninfected\npartners. In 28 of these cases, genetic\nanalysis confirmed that one\npartner had infected the other. Of\nthese 28 infections, 27 - or 96\npercent - occurred among couples\nin which the HIV-infected partner\ndid not start antiretroviral therapy\nimmediately.\nCohen cautioned that the findings\ndon't apply to all HIV-positive\npeople. \"Our couples had big advantages,\"\nhe said. We enrolled couples who probably have a low\noverall transmission [HIV] rate,\"\nhe said.\nThe researchers also made sure\nthat the patients were taking their\nantiretroviral medications. And, the\nmedications were carefully selected.\n\"The drugs are important:' Cohen\nsaid. \"We didn't use any combination\npossible - we used ones we\nthought would sterilise the genital\ntract,\" he said.\nCommenting on the study, Dr\nAlexis Powell, an assistant professor\nof infectious diseases at the\nUniversity of Miami Miller School\nof Medicine, said that 4t's nice to\nfinally have evidence-based information\nthat clearly shows that earlier\ntreatment with antiretrovirals can\nbenefit the individual who is HIV positive,\nbut also protects Sexual partners who are HIV-negative.\"\nMost doctors would like to treat\nHIV patients sooner, Powell said.\n\"We clearly understand that  patients\nbenefit with earlier treatment,\" she\nsaid. \"And this is another reason to\nstart early!'\nBarriers\nPowell said she'd like to put HIV\npatients on antiretroviral as soon\nas they are diagnosed, but there are\nbarriers. They include criteria for\ntreatment set by insurance company, lack offending and convince\nsome HIV\u00b7positive people to take\nthe drugs. Some are reluctant to\nstart taking medications that they\nwill have to take for the rest of\ntheir lives, while others are wary\nof side effects. Some people think\nthe drugs make you sicker than the\nvirus. And still others distrust the\nmedical system to act in their best\ninterest, Powell said.\nShe cautioned that the study\nfindings do not mean that people\ncan stop practising safe sex. Men,\nespecially, need to use a condom to\nprotect thernselves or their partners,\nPowell said (NYT"}
