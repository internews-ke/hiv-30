{"text": "December 7,\u00a02011\nWomen with HIV want children too\nBy ASUNTA WAGURA\nI cannot talk enough about the plight of childless women living with HIV. And that is because most of them suffer in silence and are afraid to let anyone into their anguished longings. \nI was reminded recently of when I travelled to Milan, Italy, for a meeting. During a tea break, Mary, one of my friends who was also a participant, suggested that we take a walk. \nI had a lot on my mind, and most of it was centred on my quest to get pregnant. \n\u201cSince this is my second year with secondary infertility, I must stop travelling, however necessary it may seem, and focus on my baby project,\u201d I told myself, oblivious to the beauty surrounding me.\nI regretted the fertile years I had wasted, but at the back of my mind, I knew that back then, I just could not afford to try for the children I longed so much for. There were three reasons. \nFirst and foremost, you guessed it, there was HIV. I know I have lived positively with HIV for what seems like forever and I should know better, but I still feared, more than anything, getting a baby who would then die of Aids-related complications. I knew that if this happened, it would leave me sicker and more depressed. \nThe other reason was that I had to take care of my siblings, and finally, settle down financially. \nBy the time I accomplished these, time was up. Mary, as if reading my thoughts, said, \u201cAsunta, I hope what you said in the papers was only for entertainment. You can\u2019t go about giving birth in your HIV status. Besides, you\u2019re a role model to so many, and a leader.\u201d\nShe was speaking about what I had written in this column about wanting to have another baby because I felt that my biological clock was ticking at a faster rate. \n\u201cDo you know how it feels for a childless woman living with HIV when, for instance, she goes to church and people walk in and out holding their children in their arms?\u201d I shot back. \n\u201cSometimes they have even more than two\u00a0and all you can do is wish that they were yours, walk back into your corner after giving your offering, and raise your hands to praise the Lord like everything is fine,\u201d I continued.\n\u201cAnd when you get home, the only audible noise is of your breathing and footsteps, and utensils, so you put on the radio and crank up the volume to kill the silence and loneliness that are competing with HIV to kill you,\u201d I charged.\nI know some of these things because once upon a virus, I was a childless woman living with HIV. \nThat was before God blessed me with Peter. Before I had the courage to stand up to people who were out to discriminate against Peter and me. \nBefore I had the courage to try out for two more babies because something in my womb \u2014 and only a woman knows this \u2014 was crying out for more bundles of joy. \nI know some of these things because, in my line of work, I get to interact with childless women living with HIV. \nThese women confide that having a child of their own, the fruit of their womb, would give them the will to fight another day. \nI have seen some women living with HIV die, literally, because they went against their doctor\u2019s orders and conceived, even after being forewarned that their CD4 count was dangerously low. \nI do not blame them. I know where they are coming from. I was there too, and I could have done anything to have a baby. In fact, I did everything to have Joshua and Issa. \nFor a childless sister living with HIV, and who is dying for a baby, no price is too high. \n\u201cWhen I go home, the next thing you will hear is that I have got that child you\u2019re trying to advise me against having,\u201d I told Mary. \nI meant every single word. \nAs we walked back to the meeting hall, I said a silent prayer: \u201cGod, I want to feel how people feel when they have more than one child. I know I may sound selfish, but when I have more than one child, I will feel complete. I know You can hear me and, in Your own appointed time, You will send me an answer.\u201d \nI thank God for giving me my answers. Three beautiful answers that bring love and laughter \u2014 and some screaming meemies \u2014 into this woman\u2019s life. \nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother-of-three who tested HIV-positive 24 years ago.
