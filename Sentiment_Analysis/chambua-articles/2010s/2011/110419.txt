{"text": "April 19,\u00a02011\nHIV will never be just another disease \n0 Comments \nPrint \nBy ASUNTA WAGURA\nI was in Mombasa when one of my friends called me and asked me whether I had heard on the news that Aids was no longer a big issue. \nI wanted to ask so many questions about what this statement meant because the last time I checked, people were still dying as they could not access antiretroviral drugs.\nUnfortunately, the person telling me also had limited information, although it was clear from whoever announced this that Aids will no longer be given special attention because it has been levelled together with other diseases that also require to be addressed. \nI wanted to agree with this and at the same time disagree. I can agree on the basis that Aids is no longer such a big issue. It is people who complicate the whole picture about Aids, especially when they attach deathly tags to it.\nThis was prevalent in the earlier campaigns when HIV was always represented by skulls and bones. It is first a social disease and sexually transmitted, and so it calls for being treated like any other sexually transmitted disease. However, the way people whisper about it leaves no doubt that it is a special disease. \nWe may want to pull out from this, but it will take a long time. I agree, it needs to be treated specially, but from the beginning, we treated it in a special way.\nWhen parents die and leave children, we hear of terminologies such as Aids orphans and vulnerable children. However, there are no accident orphans or diabetic orphans. The fact is, any child that is orphaned, regardless of what the parents died of, will face challenges. \nBut for \u201cAids orphans\u201d, people try to talk more on the course of death\u00a0as being Aids,\u00a0somehow placing a moral grading on the person who has died, and leaving the bereaved to deal with the stigma.\nWhat my friend heard was an unfortunate\u00a0outburst, one that only undermined the fight against Aids. HIV can and will never be like any other disease. We have an alarming increase\u00a0of new infections.\nSustainability, accessibility, and affordability of HIV treatment, which is a lifelong\u00a0commitment, are still big issues. A\u00a0nation with a\u00a0national HIV prevalence rate of over 7 per cent\u00a0of its population with close to 1.6 million infected people and only a third on treatment should not be saying that this is not a big deal.\nWe have issues of TB/HIV co-infection, emergence of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) among the HIV-positive population, issues of mitigating the impact of HIV, weak health systems, \u00a0poor funding for\u00a0HIV programmes \u2014 I could go on.\nMaybe, just maybe, HIV shall cease being a big issue when people living with the virus can walk into any company in this country and get employed if they are qualified, regardless of their HIV status.\nAs it is, most insurance companies will not cover HIV-positive clients. I also know friends who refuse to disclose to their families that they are living with HIV because they fear rejection and judgement. \nAnd what about discordant couples? Do we have discordant couples in other diseases? No. Aids cannot and will never be like any other condition.\nIn this regard, Kenya will have the dubious distinction of being the first country globally to place itself in this unacceptable claim that Aids is just another disease. \nTo be fair, I believe that only the wearer of the shoe knows where it pinches. This is why I will not try to compare \u201cmy\u201d disease with what other people are living with.\nI know how, even in these times when there is knowledge almost everywhere, stigma and discrimination from just one person in the crowd of understanding people hurts.\nI know how it hurts when someone says or does something to my child because of my HIV status. If being discriminated against in one\u2019s own country is not a big issue, then I don\u2019t know what it. \nYes, HIV might not be the big issue, but it is a big issue. That is why governments all over the world are using quite a sizeable chunk of their resources to address this virus. \nUntil we have a cure, a vaccination, an HIV-free generation, a world that is free of stigma and discrimination, and no more orphaned and vulnerable children languishing on the fringes of society, then HIV will always be a big issue. \nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother of three who tested HIV-positive 24 years ago.
