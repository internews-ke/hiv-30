{"text": "February 22,\u00a02011\nA piece of paper cannot define who you are \n0  \nBy ASUNTA WAGURA\nWhen you test HIV positive, you tend to lose your self-worth, and feel like a part of you has been taken away. This is why many people who test HIV positive take refuge in denial, because they don\u2019t want people to perceive them differently. \nThe fact is, the HIV test takes nothing physical from you, but when you get out of the room with the news that you carry the virus, you feel as if a big chunk of who you are has been taken away.\nThis explains why most counsellors insist on following up on their clients because it cannot take just one session to help someone reclaim what they lost with positive diagnosis.\nI remember a case of one woman who had come to my office with an \u201cofficial document\u201d, as she called it, indicating that she was HIV negative. \n\u201cPlease tell me what I\u2019ll do,\u201d she implored, and I could tell from her voice that she was hurting. \n\u201cDo what?\u201d I asked politely, because I did not want to make things worse than they already were. \n\u201cPeople around where I live have already started talking about me, and saying that I have HIV because my husband died of HIV-related complications,\u201d she answered falteringly. \nShe did not know what to do; she was not in a support group and, by the look of things, had reached the tipping point: when denial leads you to do crazy things. HIV has a way of messing up with your mind, and what people were saying was causing this woman more harm than the HIV itself. It is how the human psyche works; people\u2019s words can either make or break you. \nJudging from what she was saying, I knew that this woman knew the truth about her HIV status, but she was yet to accept it. She thought that an \u201cofficial document\u201d stating that she was HIV negative would reclaim her old life back and stop tongues from wagging. \nThis is the same trick that, some years back, a church leader played on some desperate people leaving with HIV. He led them to believe that they would be healed.\nAfter prayers and being pronounced free from HIV, these gullible PLWHs were told to go to a specific clinic that was working in cahoots with this church. They were tested and given an \u201cofficial document\u201d stating that they were HIV negative. \nThat is why I was categorical and I told this woman that it doesn\u2019t matter so much what people say about her: what matters is the truth of what she knew about her HIV status. \n\u201cThere are three beings one cannot lie to,\u201d I got straight with her, \u201cthese are you, God and Satan.\u201d\nAfter that, she opened up and told me more stuff, even confessing, incredulously, that she had bought the \u201cofficial document\u201d because she wanted people to believe that she was HIV negative, while all along, she knew she was living with HIV.\nI perfectly understand the part about trying to lie to other people to gain their acceptance, but I\u2019m still trying to understand how she could have cheated herself.\nWell, finally we agreed that instead of putting so much effort in what people say, she should save her energy and channel all her efforts on how she could lead a healthy, productive, and constructive life just being what she was - HIV positive. \n\u201cWhat we are inside determines what we project on the outside,\u201d I counselled her, for I saw that she was getting it all wrong, trying to clean the outside while the inside was rotting away. \nSelf-esteem cannot be found in an \u201cofficial document\u201d, whatever that means. And neither can acceptance and all the other tidings that come with living positively. You have to work hard for it, day and night, and you have to stop letting what other people say to define who we are and what we can do. \nYou may feel like you have lost everything and that it\u2019s the end of the world, but if you wipe the tears from our eyes and stop looking at things through a teary and blurry view, you will see things differently.\nA piece of paper may change people\u2019s perspectives, and stop tongues from wagging for a while, but this paper will be our secret death certificate. \nIt will take this woman some getting used to, but once she realises that it starts with her, she will stop playing to the gallery and start to listen to her inner woman. \nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother of three who tested HIV-positive 24 years ago. She is the executive director of the Kenya Network of Women with Aids (KENWA).\nasuntawagura@hotmail.com"}
