{"text": "RELATIONSHIPS I Couple adopts two children to make their 'marriage' complete\nHow same-sex couple found each other\nWomen say life has not been easy\nas they were disowned by their\nfamilies, shunned by friends and\ncannot even go for Christian\nfellowship for fear of being mocked\n\nBYKNA\nM any theories exist about\nhow human beings\ncame into existence,\nwith Christians saying that man\nwas created by God and given\nthe power to multiply, while\nscientists persuade us that man\nevolved from apes.\nWhichever the case, mankind\nhas changed from existence up\nto now. In most societies, the\nonly known marriage is between\nman and woman. But there has\nbeen an increase in the number\nof men and women claiming to\nbe lesbians or gays.\nAlthough such claims are illegal\nin most constitutions, the\npractice thrives secretly, despite\nthe spirited resistance from the\nChurch and pro-life activists.\nPractice thrives\nCloser home, the practice\nthrives in Eldoret Town's Hururna\nestate in Uasin Gishu County.\nMercy Wafula and Amondi\nLavenda are living together\nunder one roof as husband and\nwife. They kept journalists waiting\nfor a while for their story before\nthey appeared in the living room,\nholding hands and giggling.\nMercy who is the head of the\nhousehold, poured out her heart.\nShe, \"he'~ perhaps, said they met\nwhile in high school when she was\nin Form Three while her partner\nwas in Form One.\nMercy said it took her quite\nsome time to express her feelings\nto Lavenda, as she did not know\nhow she would react.\n\"I could watch her daily leave\nfor classes, since we shared the\ndormitory. Her beauty, body size\nand elegant walking style summarised\nher whole being.\"\n\"I decided to start by being\nher friend - call it courtship;\nwe could go for meals together.\nI would buy her \"escort\" (bread,\nndazi, samosa, etc) during breakfast\nand even help her wash her\nclothes so that I could win her;'\nshe said.\nShe added that they became\ncloser, which \"was to my advantage\".\nOne day, as they were\npreparing to go for evening\nstudies (preps), rains started\nand they stayed back in the\ndormttory. As they were lying in\ntheir beds, she kissed Lavenda\nREACTION\nUnion welcomed\n\"The Lesbian Gay Bisexual\nTransgender and Intersex community\nbelieves this couple will\nraise the children just as well as\nany other couple,\" general manager\nMr Gitau told the Nation Yesterday.\n\"As GALCK we welcome this\nas a first among many positive\nthings to come,\" he added.\nMr Gilau added that Kenya was\nyet to accept such unions \"but\nwould get there.\"\nwho looked shocked but didn't\nresist the kiss.\n\"This came as a surprise to\nme as I had expected a slap on\nmy face...\"\nLavenda cut in to say that she\ncould not explain what happened.\n\"Honestly, I was not expecting\nsomething like that to happen as\nI had never experienced it before\n...being kissed by a fellow girl had\nbeen the last ofmy expectations.\nI found myself too weak to defend\nmyself,\" she said.\nAfter that kissing incident,\nMercy said, they took their relationship\nto another level. They\ncould write each other letters, and\nfrequently met in the dormitory\nwhen the others were in class.\nThey would share the same bed\ndespite the fact that it was against\nthe school rules.\nDespite being reported to the\nadministration three times, they\ncontinued with the relationship\n'as the prefect had no evidence to\nwarrant any punishment.\nAs to how they satisfied each\n. other's desires, they said they\nonly touched and kissed. Lavenda\nsays she completely lost\ninterest in men.\nIt wasn't long before Mercy\nleft school ahead of her partner.\nBut they vowed to continue being\ntogether and that nothing would\nseparate them.\nMercy and Lavenda have been\ntogether for seven years and are\ncomfortable with their future\nunder the same status.\nMercy works with an NGO in\nEldoret, providing for \"his\" wife\nand their two adopted children\n- Sam. and James aged seven and\nfive years. The \"family\" did not\nwant their picture taken.\nHis mother\" and \"father\" said they\nopted to adopt children so that\ntheir relationship could be more\nlively and complete.\nThey admit that life has not\nbeen easy as they were disowned\nby their families, shunned by\nfriends and could not even go for\nChristian fellowship anywhere for\nfear of being mocked, but they\nsay they don't have to please\nother people.\nMercy says she was introduced\nto the practice by her aunt, who\nwas taking care of her after her\nparents divorced.\n\"My mum took me to go and\nstay with her younger sister.\nThough she was not married,\nshe struggled to put food on the\ntable for myself and some of our\ncousins. She then started coming\nto my room at night. I did not\nknow who to talk to, so I decided\nto keep quiet and learn to leave\nwith things the way they were.\"\nAnd Lavenda, the fourth-born\nin a family of five children says\nthat she comes from a Christian\nfamily and she is the only one\nleading that kind of lifestyle.\nThey are hoping that the\ngovernment will soon put forth\na law that accommodates their\nlifestyle.\n''We don't see anything wrong\nwith what were are doing and the\nsociety should give us and others\nwith similar lifestyles a chance\nto live happily like other people;'\nthey said.\nThey say there are many others\nleading their lifestyle, but they\nhave remained in secret due hostility\nfrom the society."}
