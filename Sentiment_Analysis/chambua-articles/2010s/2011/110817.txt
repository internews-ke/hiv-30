{"text": "In sickness and in health\nTwo women who have tested positive for HIV while their spouses\nare negative, speak of the confusion and fear of rejection by their\nspouses when they discovered that they were infected. For Atieno\nand her husband, Onyango, not even the virus will separate them.\nHowever, not all unions of discordant couples survive\n\nBY LORRAINE ANYANGO\nFor about six months some\neight years ago, Pamela Atieno Odhiambo\nwas getting sick every now and then.\nDoctors treated her for various ailments\nand she was in and out of hospital. But\njust when she thought she was regaining\nher health, she got so ill that she was in\nbed for three weeks.\nAtieno had a severe headache that defied\npainkillers. She developed rashes all\nover the body and vomited anything she\nate. So sick was she that she wondered if\nshe would live to see another day.\nWhen she eventually regained her\nstrength, Atieno summoned courage and\nvisited a voluntary counselling and testing\n(VCT) centre to ascertain her HIV\nstatus. While she was writhing in pain,\nshe had nursed daily worries about her\nHIVstatus.\n\"To put the matter to rest, I secretly\nvisited a VCT centre in my neighbourhood\nat Nairobi's Kibera slums:' says\nthe 34-year-old mother-of-three. Atieno\ndescribes her 30-minute wait at the\nVCT centre as the longest she had ever\nendured. She was anxious about the outcome,\nand yet the shattering news had to\nbe delivered: Atieno was HIV-positive.\n''When the bombshell was dropped, I\nwas confused. I didn't know what to do\nor where to go from there. I wanted to\nrun away to an. undisclosed destination\nwhere I would not have to face my husband\nand children;' she recalls. Well, she\ncould have run away, but she could not\nrun away from the truth - that indeed\nshe was HIV-positive.\nLuckily, at the VCT centre, she was\nappropriately counselled after sharing\nher fears of rejection by her husband and\nfamily. But her worst fear was how to\ndisclose the news to them. Where would\nshe start?\nBefore she met and married William\nOnyango 17 years ago, she had a couple\nof other relationships. But she swears\nthat after marrying Anyango, she never\ncheated on him, not even once. So, from\nwhere did she pick the virus?\nBack home that evening, she could not\nfind the words to disclose her HIV status\nto her family. Atieno kept the secret\nto herself, although the battle within to\nbreak the news, at least to her husband,\nfelt like a bomb ready to explode. Yet she\nstill doubted that she had the virus.\n\"After a week I visited yet another VCT\ncentre just to confirm the results, and\nnothing had changed. The results were\nthe same:' she says.\nTwo weeks later, she even became intimate\nwith her husband. Still in denial,\nshe went for a third test, but the results\nhad not changed. Clearly, there was no\nneed to seek further confirmation.\nWhat tormented her most now was that\nshe continued being intimate with her\nhusband, yet she was aware of the risk of\nre-infection and, in case her husband was\nnegative, the risk of infecting him. There\nbeing no other way to tell him the news,\nshe came up with a plan. She told him\nthat the doctor wanted to see him. \"But I\ndid not tell him why:' she adds.\nIt was the doctor who broke the news\nof his wife's HIV status to Onyango, 43,\nin her presence. The doctor advised that\nthey both take another test together,\nwhich Onyango did not have a problem\nwith. The results revealed that his wife\nwas HIV positive while he turned out\nto be HIV-negative. In other words they\nwere a discordant couple, where one\nspouse is HIV-positive and the other\nnegative.\nOnyango received the news calmly,\npartly because he and his wife had been\nadequately counselled that being HIVpositive\nwas not the end of life and that\none could still live for many years with\nproper care and diet.\nBut Atieno believes that it is because\nhe is older and was more mature that\nthe news did not shake him so much.\nBesides, some of his friends had been\ndiagnosed with the disease and he had\nseen how they had easily succumbed to\nit because of denial. So he was set to deal\nwith the situation differently, if only to\nhelp his wife, whom he loves.\nBut initially, things were not all rosy in\ntheir relationship. Sometimes he would\nget stressed over it, and his friends did\nnot make things easier. They advised\nhim to leave his wife and marry another\none. This strained his relationship with\nAtieno. He pondered over it and one day\nhe decided that life had to move on with\nthe mother of his children. He ignored\nhis friends' advice.\nBut such the move would cost him his\ncompanions, who had stood by him in\ntimes of joy and sor;row. However, in this\nparticular sorrow - an HIV-positive wife\nand the attendant opportunistic infections\nnow - they all fled. In fact, he is\nnow viewed as an outcast.\nThe couple has been living happily in\nmarriage for eight years now since that\ngrim diagnosis. Their firstborn son is 17\nyears old, while the last born, who came\nafter Atieno tested positive, is seven.\nThey are all HIV-negative.\nBut what kept them going? Atieno says\nher husband's attitude, particularly, has\nmade things easier for them because \"he\nhas never been scared of me. He resolved\nto stand by me and never asked where I.\npicked the virus from\". .\nAtieno maintains that she has never\nbeen unfaithful to her husband. \"In fact,\nmy question is: might I have had it all\nalong from a previous relationship and\nnever infected my husband or children\nduring birth?\" she adds.\nOnyango's courage is perhaps the reason\nhe asked his wife for another child,\neven when he was fully aware that she\nwas HIVpositive. Atieno was surprised\nat first, but Onyango kept fear out of the\nway and they were blessed with a healthy\nbaby.\nAtieno recalls that when they decided\nto get pregnant, they went for counselling\nand her CD4 count was taken into\nconsideration. Mother-to-child prevention\nwas not stressed at that time but she\nensured that she ate well during her pregnancy.\nShe breastfed her baby exclusively\nfor several months and weaned him on\nspecial porridge for HIV children. It was\ndistributed in hospitals at the time.\nThe couple does not engage in unprotected\nsex and condoms have become\npart of their life. Another precautions\nthat they take is that Onyango goes for\na test every three months. Atieno counts\nherself lucky to have a supportive husband\nwho always accompanies her to\nclinic for check-ups and even reminds\nher to take her medication.\nNancy'S story\nFor Nancy Apondi, who is also living\nwith HIV; the story is different. Nancy\ndiscovered she was HIV-positive back in\n2007 when she was expecting her third\nbaby. Not expecting bad news, she had\ncasually attended the antenatal clinic\nand tests were run, as is normal for\npregnant women. The news hit her like\na thunderbolt and she almost collapsed.\nShe too says she had no idea how she got\nthe virus.\nLike Atieno, the news threw her in\nconfusion, particularly because she did\nnot know how she would begin to ex plain it all to her husband. What if he\nis not HIV-positive as well? Will he turn\nviolent? Will he divorce me? What becomes\nof my children? These are some\nof the questions that ran in her mind as\nshe walked back home. On this day, she\ncould not gather enough courage to disclose\nthe news.\nOn the second day. she decided she\nwould tell him after dinner, hoping that\nshe would be stronger then, but overwhelmed\nby anguish she kept quiet. The\nthird night she was determined not to\nsee yet another dawn without informing\nher husband the truth. \"I gathered\nstrength and I told him that I had the\nHIV virus:' says Nancy.\nShe recalls he went quiet for a while\nas if to let the news sink.. But when the\ncouple visited a VCT centre, her husband\ntested negative. \"When the VCT\nattendant released the results, there was\nsilence in the room for about five minutes.\nNone of us wanted to speak first:'\nNancy recalls.\nSatisfied the news had been received,\nand the shock well absorbed, the VCT\nattendant went on with the post-test\ncounselling. Nancy's husband promised\nto give her all the support she would\nneed. But on the way home he was unusually\nquiet and Nancy got scared. Very\nscared.\nHis silence continued up to around\nmidnight when all hell broke loose. The\nsilence turned into blows and kicks and\nshe was thrown out of the house with her\ntwo children;\n\"I was so afraid, afraid that he would\nbeat me to death. He told me to take my\nvirus where I had collected it. I knew I\nhad to give him time to come to terms\nwith my HIV status, so I went to a\nfriend's house where I spent the night\nwith the children:' she recalls.\nThe following day, Nancy enlisted the\nhelp of peer educators who visited her\nhusband and tried to talk to him about\ndiscordant couples, but he did not want\nto listen.\nAfter he kicked out his first family,\nseveral months later Nancy would learn\nthat her husband was courting a younger\nwoman. Soon, he moved in with her and\nthey were now living together.\nDiscordant couples\nThese two couples are among\n344,000 HIV-discordant couples who\nhave been tested in Kenya and who are\ngoing through varied challenges. The\nnumber of discordant couples stands at\n5.9 per cent of the general population,\naccording to the Kenya Aids Indicator\nSurvey (KAIS).\nA discordant couple refers to a situation\nin which a couple is married, cohabiting\nor engaging in a steady sexual\nrelationship with one of the partners\nbeing HIV-positive and the other HIVnegative.\n\"In discordant relationships, levels of\nstigma and discrimination are high, with\nwomen generally more discriminated\nagainst than men:' Nancy says.\nThe predominant mode of HIV transmission\nis heterosexual contact. Other\nmodes of transmission are through infected\nblood and unsafe injections. Now,\nsuch couples have an opportunity to be\npart of an organisation formed by other\ndiscordant couples to ease their burden.\nThe organisation, Discordant Couples of\nKenya (Discok), already has formed 57\ndiscordant couples and support groups\nin 17 districts in four regions of Kenya\nand recruited 1,132 members. Some\n4.138 couples have also been counselled\nand tested.\n\"Discok is run by discordant couples\nfor discordant couples. We help other\ncouples who are in HIV-discordant relationships.\nMany couples do not know\nthat they are HIV-discordant and so we\nstress the importance of couples testing\nfor  HIV together:' Mr. Churchill Alumasa,\nthe Discok programme director, said.\nA major challenge for such couples is\nthe decision to remain childless or risk\ninfection. Some of them end up risking\ninfection just to experience the joy of\nhaving their own babies. Discok seeks\nto address other challenges discordant\ncouples face, including emotional and\npsychological pain brought about by\ndiscordance, need for care and treatment,\nfamily planning options, gender\ninsensitivity, STIs, and other sexual and\nreproductive health needs and social\nsupport.\nDuring the launch of the organisation,\ndiscordant couples came out in public\nfor the first time to share what they were\noffering with the aim of helping others\nand create a forum for the previously\n\\U1told stories of couples living in discordant\nrelationships.\nour aim is to keep couples and\nfamilies together happily and ensuring\nthat they are free from any new HIV\ninfections:' Discok field officer Pronicah\nLiani said\nTheir help includes referral to care and\ntreatment services, offering a support\nnetwork through monthly meetings with\nother discordant couples, and empowering\nthe couples.\n\"I tell the community that they need\nto know their status as a couple and as\na family. You can tell your family and\nyou get empowered because being discordant\nis nonna1:' Discok field officer\nGeorge Osora says.\nBefore Discok, HIV discordance was\nan a rumour that could not be substantiated\nand so was spoken of in low, hushed\ntones as it was thought that there was no\nway one partner could be HIV-positive\nand the other negative.\nAccording to KAIS, 7.1 per cent of\nKenyan adults aged between 15 and 64\nyears are infected with HIV. This trans\u00b7\nlates to 1.4 million people.\nThere are 166,000 new HIV infections\nannually in Kenya and of these, 5.9 per\ncent of married or cohabitating couples\nin Kenya are discordant. However, the\nnumber of discordant couples in the\ncountry could be much higher because\nmany people do not know their HIV status\nor that of their partners.\nIn Kenya, 77 per cent of people in married\nor cohabiting relationships do not\nknow their sexual partner's HIV status.\nDiscordance is more common where\nthe man is more than 15 years older than\nthe woman and in polygamous unions"}
