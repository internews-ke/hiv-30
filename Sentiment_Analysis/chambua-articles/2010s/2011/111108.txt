{"text": "Why Those Pills Are Important\nBy\u00a0ASUNTA WAGURA\nI believe that one of the most important things to a person living with HIV is their level of immunity.\nMost of us living with HIV will not admit it, but we constantly stress ourselves out, wondering if our immunity has hit rock bottom or if it\u2019s healthy enough.\nFor those in the dark, immunity to people like me has everything to do with one\u2019s CD4 count; the unpigmented large cells in blood that help to protect the body against infections.\nHowever, the numbers and how one physically looks do not always add up. I know of people living with HIV whose CD4 counts have reached single digits, yet they look healthy.\nThis is not to say that they shouldn\u2019t be afraid, because at such times, what may seem like a minor infection, such as a common cold, can cause sleepless nights.\nI was reminded of the issue of immunity when I was watching the reality series, Survivor, where the victorious contestant earns a necklace that symbolises immunity. Whoever wins immunity cannot be voted out of the contest.\nIn some respects, it is the same thing with those living with HIV. I have the nagging feeling that perhaps, just perhaps, the creators of Survivor took a cue from what some of us go through.\nYou see, we have to fight for immunity every single day and night of our lives because it is one of the things that guarantees us our lives. A CD4 count is a key determinant of whether one will need antiretroviral drugs, those medicines that have kept me going like the Energiser bunny.\nHowever, most people living with HIV, me included, have an apathy to going for CD4 count tests.\nMy doctor has to keep reminding me about it and, I guess because of fear of what might come out of it, I usually postpone the appointments.\nAt such times I reason (wrongly so) that what I don\u2019t know will not hurt me, although I should know better because knowledge is power.\nAs I said earlier, fighting for immunity is not a ceremony. It\u2019s not something I do when I want to, it is part of my daily schedule. I do it first thing in the morning when I have a balanced diet and then take my antiretrovirals. I do it by thinking positively, because it is true what the Bible says about a man\u2019s thoughts either making or breaking him.\nAlthough seeing is believing, I can\u2019t see what\u2019s going inside my blood cells, how they are constantly in battle with a persistent foe who is known to mutate if, for instance, I stop taking my medicines.\nThat is why I cannot overemphasise the importance of taking these life-prolonging drugs everyday until a doctor says otherwise.\nI understand that it isn\u2019t possible for some people to take these drugs regularly. If this is the case, be open with your doctor.\nThings we take for granted such as having a treatment buddy and being in a support group are also important.\nA treatment buddy is a friend, relative, neighbour, or someone else who is living with HIV, who walks with one through this lifelong treatment journey.\nWhen it\u2019s one of those days \u2014 and there are times when it gets tiresome and one is tempted to flush her drugs down the drain \u2014 a treatment buddy will help you to hang in there.\nFighting for immunity is not a one-woman job. It requires teamwork. My treatment buddies are my children, who constantly remind me that I have to take my medicine.\nIt is a symbiotic relationship; by keeping me on my toes and out of harm\u2019s way, they know, albeit unconsciously, that they will have a mother. The reverse is true: I don\u2019t want to do anything that will turn my children into orphans.\nIt\u2019s not all doom and gloom, this fight for immunity. There are times when, after going for a CD4 count test, my doctor tells me that my viral load is undetectable. I allow myself to celebrate such victories, although I still keep a weather eye open.\nAlthough it is good when our CD4 count is high, we should not just live for this one thing. Fighting for immunity does not mean that we should mercilessly flog ourselves to reach a certain magic number.\nSometimes the body and mind do not work in sync, and this calls for time-outs.\nFighting for immunity does not mean that all other things come a distant second. The ultimate survivors know how to prioritise so that this virus has no way to \u201cvote\u201d them out of life."}
