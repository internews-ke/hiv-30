{"text": "Tourism lobbies reject proposed air fare tax\nPlayers in the tourism sector have opposed proposals for an air fare levy to help fund HIV care and treatment. The operators said the proposed tax would spell doom for them as well as the economy.\nThe levy approach has also been rejected by Kenya Airways, on whom the government\u2019s proposal hinges.\nOn Wednesday last week, Public Health and Sanitation minister Beth Mugo announced a government plan to introduce a special tax on air tickets for international flights originating from Kenya.\u2028In the proposal, the minister argued that a charge of between Sh80 and Sh160 on every ticket was an easy way to raise funds, adding that the programme would not be unique to Kenya.\n\u201cA memorandum on the air levy should be ready for presentation in Cabinet in about two months,\u201d Mrs Mugo said.\nBut players in the tourism sector have warned that such a move would hurt an already overburdened industry.\nThe Coast Tourism Association said it was opposed to levies that were \u201ccreated overnight to cover for failures in some ministries\u201d.\n\u201cWe are totally opposed to this haphazard proposal to introduce new taxes and levies. Air travel is already expensive enough: why do we want to make it even more costly?\u201d asked Mr Mohammed Hersi, the vice-chairman of the Mombasa and Coast Tourism Association.\nMr Hersi, who is also the regional general manager of the Sarova Hotels, asked the government to address the corruption which he said takes a lot of resources that should go towards purchasing anti-retroviral drugs.\nAlready, Mr Hersi said, the industry was shouldering a drop in tourists due to the high fares caused by soaring oil prices."}
