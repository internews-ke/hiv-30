{"text": "September 6,\u00a02011\nSorry, but I don\u2019t give handouts \nBy ASUNTA WAGURA\nIn my line of work, I have to deal with people from all walks of life. Unfortunately, some have perfected helplessness, which they have got down to an art. I can identify them just from how they talk when they come to me for assistance.\nIn the early days of HIV, when non-governmental and community-based organisations were providing material support to people living with the virus, some of these people moved between different organisations, lugging home all the goodies that they could get their hands on.\nI even know of some people who pretended to be HIV-positive so that they could get material help. \nI think that, because time and experience have been my best teachers, I have developed a thick skin. And this means that instead of improving my relationship with some relatives, friends, and others, I\u2019m moving from bad to worse in their books because of my approach to life.\nFor instance, I no longer attend just any fundraising. Experience has taught me to read between the lines, and I know that some of the people behind some of them are up to no good.\nSome label the fundraisings with fancy titles such as goat-eating or tea, but even a fool can immediately see that there is no free meat or tea. One will have to pay. What do they say? There is no free lunch; you must pay for the paperwork.\nAnd you can almost immediately tell that there is a person behind it all who does not want to work, rather, just wants to reap where they did not sow.\nI\u2019m reminded of an incident where I put such a person in her place and gave her a piece of my mind. She came to my office, telling me that she had travelled all the way from western Kenya, and that she needed financial help like yesterday. \n\u201cOur organisation does not give, and has never given money handouts to anyone,\u201d I explained, and added that, if she had heard that we do such a thing, it was not true.\nI explained to her that we are in the business of empowering women. Giving them fish instead of teaching them how to fish \u2014 equipping them with life skills, so to speak \u2014 would only disempower them. \n\u201cWe\u2019re in the business of, resources permitting, giving our deserving members leg-ups, not handouts,\u201d I told her. \n\u201cI understand, but please hear me out,\u201d she went on. \u201cI want some money because my creditor is threatening to auction even the clothes on my back, yet my husband is doing nothing about it.\u201d\nAt this point, I insisted to know the genesis of her predicament, and what she told me almost made me throw her out of my office. It is what is known in Kiswahili as, \u201cmsiba wa kujitakia\u201d \u2014 self-inflicted misery.\n\u201cI took a loan to set up a business, but temptation got the better of me and I put all the money on the TV lotteries where you send text messages. I sent tonnes of those messages.\u201d\nIn her foolishness, she assumed the money could not run out before she had won the jackpot, after which she would pay her creditors and have a reasonable amount to spend.\nBut a fool and her money are soon parted. She did not win even a cent and that is why she was in a rush to look for money before her household property was auctioned. \nI did not ask her why she would want money she had not sweated for. I could see that she was already stressed and it was not the time or place to lecture her on her foolishness. I\u2019m one of those people who do not believe in luck, but hard work. So, for me gambling is out of the question. \nMy father once told me that if you can sit down and enjoy what you have not worked for, then you are calling a curse upon yourself, and you will always expect to receive, and will never give. Quoting from the Bible, I believe, he said if one does not work, then they should not eat. \nI would rather cast my bread upon the waters than waste my resources on able-bodied people who have refused to work. And that is why I will always be in the bad books of many people. HIV-positive or not, one must work. \nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother-of-three who tested HIV-positive 24 years ago. She is the executive director of the Kenya Network of Women with Aids (KENWA)."}
