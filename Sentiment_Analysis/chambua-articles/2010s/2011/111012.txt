{"text": "October 12,\u00a02011\nI\u2019ll never get used to death\nBy ASUNTA WAGURA\nA few weeks ago, I was in the state of Western Bahr El Ghazal, which is just two hours away, by air, from Juba. \nI was following up on a group of community health workers I had trained. I wanted to find out if the strategies we had laid had worked. \nPreviously, I had given them some tough love and made it clear that if they wanted to be part of our organisation, they each must identify at least 15 bedridden clients who are living with HIV. \nThey vowed that this was impossible, citing high levels of stigma and low awareness of HIV, but I remained firm because I believe in service delivery, regardless of the obstacles. \nSome of the excuses I hate are \u201cit\u2019s impossible\u201d and \u201cI can\u2019t\u201d. \nWhen they realised that I was not bluffing, they did a perfect job. Each identified at least 15 clients. Some even had more. \nThey even went a step further and formed links with the state hospital that provides antiretroviral therapy. \nOn this visit, I decided to go the hospital and see where clients were being referred to, what kind of assistance they were getting, and what more we needed to do to improve the partnership. \nOn reaching the hospital, which is in Wau, I saw dilapidated red-earthen buildings that escaped the war and which looked like they would crumble any minute. \nOutside the buildings were groups of people huddled around small fires.\n\u201cWho are those people who have lit fires in the compound?\u201d I asked the field officer who accompanied me. \u201cHow come they are allowed to light fires in the hospital\u2019s compound?\u201d \nThe officer was surprised at my questions. \u201cThose are patients preparing their meals,\u201d she replied, adding that the hospital does not have the luxury of a kitchen and that patients have to prepare their own food. I was shocked.\nI was even more shocked when I learnt that relatives have to travel to the hospital very early, or stay overnight so that they can buy their patients water from a tanker that passes by daily. It is either that or you die of thirst.\nThe hospital\u2019s only toilets are pit latrines with an over-powering stench. \nThere were also no bathrooms to speak of. It is almost a normal thing in Southern Sudan that if you are out in the open countryside, you can go on and take your bath under the cover of darkness. \nAnd this is not only for the sick; it is also the done thing for the general populace. No one will bother to look at you because bathing out in the open is common around here. \nWith us was a woman who was in stage four of Aids. We tried to see if she could be admitted, if not in the \u201chospital\u201d, then in the compound so that she could wait in the queue for the ART doctor. \nI personally intervened. I am known there as Mama wa mshikila. \nI understand mshikila is any kind of trouble and I am labelled this way because of my focus on Aids. The ART doctor had heard about me in Juba. \nThis woman\u2019s sole caregiver was her seven-year-old daughter, who was already overwhelmed by the responsibility. \nIf the doctor listened to our case, we would, hopefully, pre-empt this woman\u2019s impending demise and remove the burden of care from her child. \nAfter a lengthy consultation, she was admitted. Following the procedures, we had to go and purchase a reef mat to serve as her bed, a few utensils for her makeshift kitchen, and supplies, even though she had no energy to cook. \nWe agreed that the community workers would go to the hospital on alternate shifts to cook for her. I must say that it was quite a relief that she was finally admitted.\nHowever, our relief was short-lived because the following day, as I waited for my plane back to Juba, which was delayed because of lack of fuel, I was informed that she had passed away. \nMy heart broke, especially for her young daughter, who was used to having her mother around. \nMy heart also went out to the community workers, faced with the unenviable task of delivering the terrible news that her mother was no more. It is not an easy job, this one.\nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother-of-three who tested HIV-positive 24 years ago.
