{"text": "The futility of worrying about what wagging tongues \nBy ASUNTA WAGURA\nRecently, I lost a close relative. Carol* is not the first of my close relations to succumb to an AIDS-related complication. But the reason this death stands out is in the way the whole matter was handled. I was left with more questions than answers. I must have been silly to think that we had done a good job in creating awareness and stigma-reduction.\nWhen Carol went down with an opportunistic infection, I was informed by one of my Community Health Workers (CHW) in Nyeri who was also attending to her. During one of her visits they discussed about me and the possibility of visiting with her at home, but Carol had some conditions.\n\u201cIf you must visit me, don\u2019t come with those KENWA branded cars of yours,\u201d Carol was adamant. \u201cAnd don\u2019t even let people know that you\u2019re coming to my house, because if you do that the neighbours will know what is ailing me.\u201d \nI told my CHW I would think about it, but I was just being polite. There was nothing for me to think about. I\u2019m not ashamed of what I do.\nNeither do I walk with a lowered head because I am HIV-infected. I have neither apologies to offer nor regrets. Even with my HIV positive status, God has blessed me with a car, and I can drive. So why should I use a matatu? \nAt times, when it\u2019s absolutely necessary, I use a matatu or even boda boda, but I was not going to do it in this case. The very fact that it was HIV-related work and there was a client to be visited, I didn\u2019t see the reason not to use my car.\n\u00a0Carol\u2019s refusal was for the reason people might conclude she had AIDS. Let\u2019s get one thing clear. I visit people, who have nothing to do with AIDS, with this very vehicle, and they have no qualms. And that\u2019s why I had a problem with Carol\u2019s take.\u00a0 \nTo cut a long story short, I politely declined to visit, although my CHW continued with the home visits. Carol was trying to defend her social status. She was the deputy chairperson in her church and she didn\u2019t want her church folks to know she was ailing from a disease seen only fit for sinners.\nCarol buried herself in her own stigma, so much so that the declined future visits by any of our CHWs. Why? Because the community knows what kind of people our CHWs visit.\nAs fate would have it, Carol\u2019s game of hide and seek didn\u2019t go on for long because she died within a few months of sickness. What surprised me is the way close relatives started bad-mouthing me, that I had the audacity to help other people, even strangers, yet I couldn\u2019t help one of my own. \nDuring Carol\u2019s burial, some people refused to greet me. And when the MC called me to say a word or two, he was immediately shushed. I later learnt that the relatives refused to allow me to talk because they were afraid I would talk about nothing else but HIV/AIDS, which would\u2019ve sent confirmatory signals about what had taken Carol\u2019s life to those who attended.\nThe story didn\u2019t end there because I was labelled a pretender.\n\u201cShe pretends to help people, but when it comes to her my own she is a total disappointment.\u201d\nNobody knew the other side story, about how I had even pushed for Carol to be taken to our rescue centre. She declined and I was left with no choice but to respect her wish. Our CHWs later told me how Carol refused to take her drugs as advised because she feared what her neighbours would say.\nPerhaps I should take part of the blame. May be if I had done as she wished, things would have turned out different. Still, Carol\u2019s case is just one in many where the infected person doesn\u2019t consider the consequence of her actions to health. Instead, they are consumed with worry, wondering what people will say.\nI cannot assure anyone that people will not talk, but of priority should be one\u2019s health and what they are doing about it. Don\u2019t just refuse to go for Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT) in time for fear of what others will say. That visit could save your life. \nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother-of-three who tested HIV-positive 23 years ago.
