{"text": "March 15,\u00a02011\nEveryday, she dreams of her missing children \nBy Asunta Wagura\nWe held the first group therapy in Southern Sudan in a centre I hold dear. This centre is nothing compared to what I\u2019m used to, but it served the purpose. It\u2019s only here that I don\u2019t have to announce who we are and what we do, yet all those who come for the meeting\u00a0are the people that we target.\nWhen Alice Kiden* stood to talk, it surprised me.\u00a0I knew she had been vocal in founding the Southern Sudan Network of Women with Aids (SSUNEWA), but I didn\u2019t know she had such a hear-breaking story. \nEarlier, she had laughed when I told her I had returned to Kenya to give birth. All along, she had thought that I was fat, not pregnant. I had intended to involve her in this project from the beginning because I was aware of how dedicated she was to see her organisation get on its feet.\nI had quite a number of setbacks, one of them being the language barrier. Kiden acted as a go-between, communicating our vision, goals, and how we planned to rope in potential members.\nAnyway, Kiden stood to share her story of living with HIV. It was a testimony that made all of us break down in tears. As she cleared her throat and begun her story, one could not help but notice her amputated hand, which we soon found out, had its own story.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what has affected me most \u2014 Aids or the war that just ended,\u201d she said. \u201cDuring the war, I lost my hand as\u00a0my children and I attempted to run away. I didn\u2019t know where we were headed, all I knew was that even if we were to die, we shouldn\u2019t die at the same spot.\u201d\nKiden remembers crossing a river, but on reaching the other side, she heard a loud blast, like a bomb exploding. When she came to, she found herself in Lokichoggio hospital in Kenya, minus her children. \n\u201cWhen I woke up, the first thing I asked was where my children were. All they knew was that a\u00a0land mine had exploded and shattered part of my arm. They added that there was one more thing the doctor wanted to discuss with me.\u201d \nShe thought he wanted to tell her about her children\u2019s whereabouts. But this wasn\u2019t the case because as she was soon to learn, he knew nothing about them. The doctor wanted to know if Kiden knew what HIV was. She did not. \n\u201cI hadn\u2019t bothered much to find out about HIV,\u201d Kiden shared. \u201cI knew it was a disease, but never imagined that I could get infected. \n\u201cI had always reasoned that war-torn countries don\u2019t have time to get Aids because they already have too much to deal with. I was wrong. During the war, my husband\u2019s brother\u00a0inherited me after my husband died.\u201d\nShe suspects that this is when she contracted HIV. The baby they got together died a month after birth, although she did not relate the death with HIV.\nHer new husband had left soon after he realised that she was pregnant, leaving her with six other children from her first husband. \nObviously, she was shocked to learn that she was HIV-positive.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure whether I got this virus from my first husband or my inherited husband,\u201d she says.\nEven more heartbreaking was the fact that she does not know where two of her children are, whether they are alive or dead. \n\u201cI reunited with four of them only. Every day is a nightmare for me and I haven\u2019t stopped looking for them everywhere I go, hoping that I will see one of them before this virus takes my life.\u201d\nAs I stood to thank her for sharing her experience with us, it was hard to conceal my empathy. I didn\u2019t know exactly how to reassure her. I know we cannot promise to undo the past, but that day of opening up was the first one of the rest of our lives. \u00a0\nSSUNEWA may not assure Kiden of the return of her children, but I know it will be a shoulder to cry on in times of need, with all the other sisters and brothers living with HIV. \nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother of three who tested HIV-positive 24 years ago. She is the executive director of the Kenya Network of Women with Aids (KENWA). asuntawagura@hotmail.com"}
