{"text": "Domestic abuse: A risk factor for HIV transmission\nThousands of women in abusive\nrelationships are at an additional\nrisk of contracting the HIV virus.\nPhyllis Nyambura investigates the\nlink between abuse and the virus'\ntransmission. By Phyllis Nyambura\nWhen Kate Njoroge met the man of her dreams, she was 22, beautiful and naive. She was pursuing a degree in sociology at Kenyatta University while her boyfriend was on his way to becoming a doctor.\n\"I pictured a perfect family. My boyfriend looked and met the cut:' Kate says. In her second year she moved closer to her dream family when she got pregnant. After her studies she moved in with her beau. \"Things were really working as I had figured out as a little girt: she says.\nBut that's an old story. Kate is now 41\nand bitter at how her happy ending turned out. The mother of two's marriage turned septic a few years later after moving in.\nFirst, her man became unresponsive then\nhe started having multiple affairs. Then\nhe turned violent.\n\"I didn't have a job when I completed\ncampus and then my family got evicted\nin the 1992 tribal clashes, which meant\nmy dad, a farmer, couldn't support my\nsiblings. I had to step in and help out.\nThough my husband was working, he\nwas unsupportive. Then he started seeing\nother women,\" Kate narrates.\nTo counter the dejection Kate got her\nMBA in record time and soon landed\nherself an international job. \"He didn't\nlike it one bit,\" she says. \"He couldn't\nstomach that I had got my Masters before\nhim and now was bringing in more money.\nHe would now go missing for days, and I\nlearnt that he had actually moved in with\nanother woman and got a baby:' the NGO\nprogramme manager says.\nWary of the strings of women her\nhusband was hosting, Kate decided to\nstay away from the marital bed. \"That's\nwhen he hit me really hard. I was so\nswollen. I had withheld sex for a month\ninsisting that he must get tested:' Kate\nrecalls.\nFor years that became her life, and\nsince she could not insist that her man\nuses a condom, she resigned herself to\nher fate. In December last year, after\nnumerous bad encounters and walking\nout three times, she decided to move out.\nFor good. \"I am lucky I didn't contract\nHIV. God must really love me. But I am\nbitter that I wasted more than 20 years trying to make it work,\" Kate, who says\nshe stuck it out for love and children,\nshares.\nShe is right. Many women contract HIV\nwhen they are living a life of dependency,\npower imbalance and lack of control over\ntheir sexuality. \"Most women cannot\nnegotiate for sex. Sex is often a man's\nprerogative. That's why some women\nknow the status of their husband only\nafter their death or when they spot the\nhidden ARVs:' remarks Donata Muthoni,\n41, a peer educator at Mbagathi hospital\nwho is also HIV positive.\nThe mother of two teenage daughters,\nwho has lived with the disease for a\ndecade now, cites herself as an example.,\nsaying that if she was more empowered\nsexually, she would have taken better care\nof her sexual health.\nFor years HIV/ Aids experts have\ngrappled with the reasons behind\nwomen's high susceptibility to HIV\ninfection. A 2008/09 study put women's\nprevalence rates as twice as high as that\nfor men, which stands at 4.3 per cent.\nWhile the country's national average is\nat 6.1 per cent, that for women stands\nat eight percent. This disparity is even\ngreater amongst women aged 15-24 who\nare four times more likely to become infected with HIV than men of the same\nage.\nDoes this mean that women are more\npromiscuous? Nothing could be more\nmisleading.\nThe truth is that the 'Abstinence, Being\nFaithful and using Condoms' rule rarely\nworks for women. The ABC's, experts\nsay, oversimplify what should be ongoing\napproaches in reducing the incidences\nthat make women more vulnerable to the\ndisease.\n\"Abstinence is not an option for\nwomen who are forced or coerced in\nto sex. And even though a woman is\nfaithful, her partner might not be and\nwhen it comes to condoms, because of\npower imbalances women, especially in\nmarriages, fail to negotiate for condom\nuse, while female condoms are largely\ninaccessable, expensive and not user\nfriendly,\" comments Dr James Njiru,\nthe Gender Violence Recovery Centre\n(GVRC), medical technical advisor.\nAnd that's not all. Largely intertwined\nand only recently identified as a risk\nelement in HIV prevalence among women\nis violence. \"Kenyan women experience\nhigh rates of violent sexual contact, which\nis thought to contribute to the higher\nprevalence rate:' notes, Carol Mwai, a\nprogramme officer at the organisation.\nRecent studies from Tanzania, Rwanda\nand South Africa indicate that women\nwho have experienced violence are up\nto three times more likely to contract .\nHIV than those who have not. \"Violence\nmakes women vulnerable because most\nof them fear the man's wrath if they\nobjected or if they asked for protection.\nA lot of women married to abusive men,\nalcoholics or drug addicts are likely to\nexperience forced sex. This inaction\nmeans that they will more easily contract\nthe disease:' Susan Kithika, a volunteer\ncounsellor at Heal Africa and Tala VCT\ncentre, points out.\n\"Gender based violence and HIV share\nmany of the risk factors. These are gender\ninequities, poverty, lack of financial\nindependence and education, alcohol and\nsubstance abuse, rigid gender roles and\none experiencing or witnessing abuse as\na child. That's why we advocate for rape\nand violence victims to test for HIV,\"\nconfirms Dr Njiru.\nAnna Naliaka has experienced this first\nhand. Her husband of 10 years started\ndrinking heavily a few years ago, and\nwas often out with various women. The\nmother of three started by confronting\nher husband about his behavior, but that\nonly ended up with him detaching from\nthe family further.\nPushed by what she claims was the\nneed to protect her children from being\norphaned at an early age, she went for a\nHIV test. The results came back negative\nand she thought her solution lay in\nmoving bedrooms to avoid what she\nclaims was forced sex from her husband.\n''He wasn't happy. One day he came\nhome drunk and forced himself into the\nspare bedroom that I was occupying\nand demanded his rights. I resisted, but\nhe started beating me and accused me\nof withholding what was rightfully his.\nI had no choice but to sleep with him,\"\nshe says.\nLater, through family interventions,\nthe man consented to having a HIV test,\nwhich unfortunately turned  positive.\n\"I told him I was willing to stay on as\nhis wife. My only condition was that he\nshould stop sleeping around and that\nwe should use a condom. Everything\nwas okay for some months, but then he\nwas back to his old ways. And he started\ninsisting that condoms were not really hi:\nthing, especially with a wife,\" the 35 year\nold financial advisor says.\n\nSoon after, Anna had to leave when\nher husband started getting violent and\naggressively demanding that she consents\nto his pleas for unprotected sex. \"1 had to\nleave for the sake of the children. 1 have\nseen how much children without parents\nsuffer and 1vowed that 1would rather make\nit alone than put my children's future at\nstake,\" she says.\n\"Women who experience violence often\nhave low self esteem. To validate themselves\nthey are more likely to have multiple sexual\npartners. It allows them to think of a future\nfor themselves,\" Kithika says. Sometimes,\neven when women discover their positive\nstatus, they would rather face re-infection\nthan come clean to their spouses fearing\nabandonment or financial withdrawal.\n\"1 mow this woman at the clinic who\ntakes ARV's in secret because she says she\nwould rather die than tell her husband We\nhave tried to counsel her but she is adamant\nthat she would rather put herself at risk\nthan risk the man not paying the bills,\"\nDonata says.\nClosely linked to violence is the fact that\nin many cases, since sex is regarded as a\ntaboo, rarely do women get adequately\nprepared in the bedroom. This means that\nthey are rarely in the right mood to enjoy\nconsensual sex.\n\"For a lot of women, sex is a duty. It's\nwhat you give your husband in exchange\nfor financial favours or affection. 1 don't\nSTUDIES SHOW\nTHAT WOMEN\nWHO HAVE\nEXPERIENCED\nVIOLENCE ARE UP\nTO THREE TIMES\nMORE LIKELY TO\nCONTRACT HIV\nTHAN THOSE WHO\nHAVE NOT.\nAUNTYSUE\never remember when 1 was psychologically\nprepared to get ready for the act. Often he\ncame home late and he asked to get his\ndues. And since 1 had never really known\nanother man before 1 married my husband\nI didn't know how to go about the whole\nthing,\" confesses Kate.\nEvidence shows that it is easier for a\nwoman to contract HIV from a man than\nvice versa, due to a greater surface area of\nthe vagina that comes into contact with\nsemen, while lack of lubrication during\nencounters increases tears and abrasions\nthat are an automatic inlet for the virus.\n\"The truth is, if every unsafe encounter\nwith a positive person meant infection,\nwe would have alarming infection rates.\nAbrasions during sex is one of the reason\nwomen and uncircumcised men are more\nlikely to contract the virus,\" observes Dr\nNjiru.\nSexologist and marriage counsellor\nRoseline Achar says that if couples talked\nmore about their sexual expectations and\nworked on pleasing each other, women\nwould be less susceptible to the HIV\nvirus. \"It's about understanding how each\ngender operates. For a woman, sex is about\nemotional connection with her spouse,\nwhile for men, sex is mostly physical. What\nhappens is that if a woman doesn't feel\nemotionally taken care of by her man, she\nis not going to warm up in the bedroom,\"\nadvises Achar.\nBut many more experts call for complex\nsolutions for many women who face\ncomplex encounters with HIV. \"It calls for\na multi-faceted approach. While the ABC's\ncan work at some individual's levels, there\nis need for communities to play a part in\nmv prevention, including destigmatisation\nof the virus and support for those infected\nPlus, the health care system and legal\nframework need to aid those who are\nat risk of contracting mv, or infecting\nothers:' says Carol of COVAW. That, and\nempowering women not only economically\nbut emotionally, notes Dr Njiru, will aid the\nalready prevention measures.\n\"Men need to be empowered too so that\nthey can change their mindset,\" Kithika\npoints out.\nOne of the solutions that has been hailed\nas a success especially in violent encounters\nis the post exposure drug, Prophylaxis\n(PEP). The post rape drug that is available\nat most gender recovery centres for free to\nsurvivors has proved effective in the fight\nagainst HIVif taken within 72 hours.\n\"Women who are raped should stop\ntrying to heal themselves at home because\nthey fear the shame and report the incident\nsince if they take PEP within good time the\nvirus can be stopped from getting into their\nblood stream:' advises Kithika.\nContact the author at\nphylLnyambura@gmaIl.com"}
