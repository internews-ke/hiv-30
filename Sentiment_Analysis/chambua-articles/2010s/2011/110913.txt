{"text": "September 13,\u00a02011\nDon\u2019t be fooled by your looks \nBy ASUNTA WAGURA\nA fortnight ago, I lost a friend, and colleague to HIV-related complications. The loss was sad and tragic because it was unexpected. \nThis is not to say that other losses are expected, per se. You see, one minute he was healthy and strong, the next, he had passed away. \nFor a people living with HIV, taking good medical care of themselves is important. There\u2019s no short cut. If you don\u2019t take your meds the way you should, you\u2019re sitting on a ticking time bomb. \nThere is a lot of awareness and knowledge about HIV, that at times, it feels as if we\u2019re preaching to the choir. \nBut I have come to learn that there is a difference between having the knowledge, and putting this knowledge to good use, consistently. \nHowever, with some other people, you will not see \u201cit\u201d coming. You will not see the Grim Reaper. \nI have lost other friends this way \u2013 the same way I lost this friend \u2013 where you will, by just looking at their physical bodies, think that they are healthy and have nothing to worry about.\nJust the same way we cannot judge a person\u2019s HIV serostatus by, for instance, the slimness of their physique; people living with this virus should not judge their healthiness by their chubby frame. \nActually, this was the case decades ago when HIV was called \u201cslim\u201d because of the way it literally ate you up and left you thin and sickly. \nIn short, what I\u2019m saying is that, with HIV, what you see is not necessarily what you get. \nAnd this is one other thing that messes people\u2019s minds \u2013 the perception of being healthy \u2013 it plays tricks on their minds because when they look at the person in the mirror, they see the epitome of healthiness. \nIn the HIV community, this is prevalent with some people with the virus who, unwittingly, lay death traps for themselves by letting what is outside their seemingly healthy bodies, to lull them into a false sense of security.\nI tell everyone who cares to listen that, though seeing a doctor costs money, it gives one peace of mind. \nKnowing my CD4 count has made me aware of the right and wrong things I\u2019m doing as far as living positively is concerned. \nLiving positively is not just about getting out of denial, accepting one\u2019s HIV status and thinking right thoughts; but also about doing the right things, big and little. \nLittle things such as taking medication without fail, because these are the little bricks that build big walls of defences against opportunistic infections. \nLet me hasten to say that a low CD4 count is not a death sentence, but a sign that we need to put certain medical measures into action. \nIt is not uncommon to see, for instance, a chubby person with an extremely low CD4 count, and vice versa. \nWhat HIV does is that it attaches to cells of the immune system with special markers called CD4 receptors. \nHIV infection of CD4 cells causes cell death and impairs their function, while the reduction in the CD4 cells numbers and the effects on their functions reduces the capacity of the body to fight diseases, therefore making the body defenceless. \nThis makes people living with HIV susceptible to many infections. These are some of the things that can be avoided if we stop making one mistake: forgetting. \nThere\u2019s a tendency for human beings to be complacent and forget the lessons life taught them. \nAs people living with this virus, we cannot afford to forget the lessons that \u2013 at the cost of millions of lives - this virus has taught us - that it takes no prisoners; that it gnaws us from the inside, hungering after every red blood cell in our bodies. \nAnd, while we\u2019re at it, we cannot afford to forget that we\u2019re HIV positive. I\u2019m not implying that our HIV serostatus should preoccupy our thoughts, 24/7. \nThat said, conveniently forgetting that we\u2019re HIV positive can make us to become careless and stop doing some basic things that can mean the difference between life and death. \nI\u2019m not saying that I\u2019m perfect. I\u2019m human, and also have my slipups and close shaves. \nBut I have learnt my lessons, and whenever I look at my children, I know that I must do everything humanly possible to stay alive. \nThe Bible says that the power of life or death lies with us, with our talk and walk. I have chosen life. \nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother-of-three who tested HIV-positive 24 years ago.
