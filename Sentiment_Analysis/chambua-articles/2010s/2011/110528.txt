And\nfor one that\nbecomes a\nwoman what\nhappens\nof his male\norgans? To\nme that is\nbeing stupid\nand silly\"\n\n\nBY SAMWEL KUMBA\nAND MUCHIRI KARANJA\nThe Church fears that homosexuality,\ndivorce and abortion\nmay gain acceptance under top\njudicial nominees Willy Mutunga and\nNancy Baraza.\nIn candid interviews, top clergy told\nthe Saturday Nation the two were not\nthe safest hands to lead the Judiciary\ngiven their liberal stand on issues the\nChurch considers controversial.\nCanon Peter Karanja, the general secretary\nof the National Council of\nChurches of Kenya, said the nomination\nwas a slap in the face given the\npledge by the Principals to address\ntheir concerns after the referendum on\nthe proposed constitution last year.\nThe Church was opposed to the\nnew law for, among other reasons,\nclauses it claimed provided for abortion\nand same sex relations. President\nKibaki and Prime Minister Raila\nOdinga asked them to support the\ndocument, saying it had more good\nthan bad clauses and those that were\ninjurious to the Church would be addressed\nafter the promulgation of\nthe new law.\nThis was interpreted in some\nquarters to mean that their grievances\nwould be attended to, and the\nclergy would retain their clout in the\nnew dispensation. But recent events\nhave proved otherwise.\n'We are concerned that the proposed\nChief Justice and Deputy Chief Justice\nhave not indicated a commitment to\nthe protection of family values and\nthe right to life. Their appointment\ncould lead to the constitutionalisation\nof immorality and murder of babies;'\nwarned Canon Karanja.\nFr Vmcent Wambugu, the secretary\ngeneral of the Catholic Secretariat,\nsaid the appointment was a reflection\nof the moral crisis caused by the new\nConstitution.\nFr Wambugu said the Church opposed\nthe new law because some\nsections were undermining the basics\nof the family and the fidelity of life.\nHe said they expected to lobby\nfor change through all legal means,\nincluding judicial interpretation of\nclauses they consider contentious.\nBut Dr Mutunga's and Ms Baraza's\nperceived liberal views and the near unanimous\nsupport the nomination\nhas enjoyed among the top politicians\nhave dashed any hopes of the Church\ngetting one of its favourite to head\nthe courts.\nThis has inevitably triggered the\nlatest round of complaints on the\nConstitution, after a lull of almost\nfive months.\nIn other words, the Church fears it\nhas lost allies on the political front,\nand it doesn't want to be alienated by\na Judiciary that is not sympathetic to\nits conservative values.\n\"Certain clauses could be interpreted\nin any way. These include\nissues to do with the family as well\nas reproductive health,\" says Fr\nWambugu.\nSome are also reading trouble in the\nmarital status ofthe nominees, both of\nwhom are single. Dr Mutunga has filed\nfor divorce from his second wife, and\nthe Catholics are not amused since\ntheir religion is against divorce.\n\"Kenya is made up of families. So if\nyou break a family, what else are you\nworking for? How can we separate\na family from a public office? In the\npublic office there is moral duty to\nbe an example. This includes being a\nfamily role model. It is not optional;'\nsaid the priest.\nBesides this, the nominees are\namong the few prominent Kenyans\nwho have publicly expressed support\nfor adults to enjoy their reproductive\nrights without fear.\nDr Mutunga helped register a lobby\nfor gays and lesbians, while Ms Baraza\nis researching same sex relations for\nher doctorate degree.\nSex education\nIn a 2003 interview with AFP on\nsame sex and religion, Dr Mutunga\nsaid the Church was compounding\nthe problem by insisting on doctrines\nthat could only encourage the spread\nof Aids and other diseases.\n\"I think the influence of religion\nin this country is very harmful. They\ndon't allow proper sex education in\nschool; don't allow condoms in a\ncountry with HIV/Aids. That kind\nof rubbish makes me very mad,\"\nhe said.\nEven the lay Christians have joined\nthe fray. Last week, a group calling\nitself Professional Christians questioned\nDr Mutunga's views on life,\nfamily and religion.\nThe group has since written to Parliament\nseeking audience to present a\npetition against the nominee.\nIt claims that Dr Mutunga's\nemployer, Ford Foundation, funds\npro-abortion activities, which makes\nHim ineligible for such high office that\nwould make rulings on matters of life\nand death.\nIt named International Planned\nParenthood Federation, International\nWomen's Health Coalition, Planned\nParenthood Federation of America,\nSexuality Information and Education\nCouncil of the United States among\nthe beneficiaries of the foundation's\nmoney.\nOn Ms Baraza, the group claimed\nthat her academic writings supported\ngay rights when the Constitution outlaws\nsame sex relations.\nFrWambugu said the crisis has vindicated\ntheir opposition to the new\nlaw. He said although most clauses\nof the Constitution were good and\nprogressive, some were too inimical\nand blamed the political leadership\nfor reneging on the pledge to fix the\ncontentious issues after the vote.\n\"The flaws:' says Bishop Maurice\nCrowley of Kitale Diocese, \"we were\npromised would be addressed after\nthe referendum. We did not believe\nthat. It's nearly one year later, who\ntold the truth?\"\nIn an earlier statement read by John\nCardinal Njue, Catholic bishops called\nfor a wider criteria for picking con~\nsituational office holders. They said it\nwas not right to emphasis academic\nexcellence and reform credentials at\nthe expense of other values.\n\"Your attitude to society would\ndefinitely affect your judgments of a\nnumber of issues. Ifwe go for liberalism\nyou can have a family interpreted \nas man marrying another man. That\nis why we demanded on specificity\nduring the constitution review,\" Fr\nWambugu said.\nThe priest termed it the role of\nthe Church to remind Kenyans the\nprincipals and morals of leadership\nand justice.\n\"Nobody can take that role away\nfrom the Church. We shall come in and\nsay what is right from wrong because\nwe do not know what somebody else\ncould to start doing tomorrow,\" he\nCOURTESy\u00b7l NATION\nThe Church is\nquestioning the\nfamily credentials\nof the proposed\nheads of the Judiciary."}
