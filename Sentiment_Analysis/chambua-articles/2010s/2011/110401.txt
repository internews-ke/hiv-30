{"text": "UN takes the blame for condom shortage \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nUnited Nations on Thursday owned up to the condom shortage in the country, blaming its lengthy procurement procedures for failure to meet delivery deadlines. United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) head Babatunde Osotimehin, who is in the country, said the organization had been facing procurement problems. He, however, promised that some 45 million condoms would be delivered in the next few weeks.\n\n\n\nProcurement documents indicate that the government ordered 180 million condoms in May worth $6 million borrowed from the World Bank. The order was placed with UNFPA, which procures condoms in bulk for most African countries as this allows it to buy them at lower prices. UNFPA failed to meet the December delivery deadline, occasioning the current shortage in the public sector.\n\nAt a press conference in Nairobi yesterday called by UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon, it also emerged that the specialized agency was facing what UNAids executive director Michel Sidib\u00e9 called systemic planning and procurement problems.\n\n\n\nOne of the problems compounding the procurement process is a requirement by manufacturers that orders be paid for before product delivery. A consignment of 18.2 million condoms procured by the US President\u2019s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar) left Singapore for Kenya on Sunday and is expected to arrive in Mombasa next week.\n\nMr Ban, who was presenting the current status of the 30-year global HIV epidemic, said Kenya had made significant progress in reducing mother-to-child transmission. He introduced Mrs Rebecca Auma Awiti of Kayole, who, despite being HIV-positive, gave birth to virus-free triplets because of strict adherence to anti-retroviral drugs when pregnant.\n\n\u201cIn 2004, my husband and I made a deliberate decision to start a family despite being HIV-positive. In September 2005, I gave birth to four HIV-negative girls but unfortunately we lost one of them later,\u201d Mrs Awiti said.\n\nMr Ban said the global body\u2019s target is to eliminate mother-to-child HIV transmission by 2015\n\u00a0"}
