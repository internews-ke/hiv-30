{"text": "May 16,\u00a02011\nEarly HIV therapy protects partners from deadly virus \nPeople with HIV can reduce the risk of infecting their sex partners by more than 90 per cent if they start treatment with antiretroviral drugs when their immune system is still relatively healthy, researchers announced last week.\nThe study, which included 1,763 mostly heterosexual couples from nine countries, was supposed to last until 2015, but the results were released early because of the significance of the findings.\nThe research confirmed a belief held by many scientists and physicians \u2014 that starting drug therapy early can help to limit rates of transmission of the virus that causes Aids.\n\u201cWe set out to prove that if you took earlier therapy you could benefit your own health and you could prevent the transmission of HIV,\u201d said lead researcher Dr Myron Cohen, director of the Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\u201cBoth of those hypotheses were realised,\u201d he said. The study, which started in 2005, randomly assigned the couples to two treatment groups: \nIn the first group the HIV-infected individual began taking a combination of three antiretroviral drugs immediately. \nIn the second group, the HIV-positive person delayed drug therapy until their CD4 T-cell count \u2014 a blood test that measures immune system health \u2014 either dropped below 250 or an Aids-related illness (such as pneumocystis pneumonia) set in.\nBoth groups also received HIV care, which included counselling on safe sex, free condoms, treatment for sexually transmitted infections, regular HIV testing and evaluation, and treatment for any HIV-related complications.\nThe trial was conducted at 13 sites in nine countries including the United States, Botswana, Brazil, India, Kenya, Malawi, South Africa, Thailand and Zimbabwe.\nIn looking over the preliminary findings, the data and safety monitoring board shepherding the study identified 39 new cases of HIV among the previously uninfected partners. \nIn 28 of these cases, genetic analysis confirmed that one partner had infected the other. \nOf these 28 infections, 27 \u2014 or 96 percent \u2014 occurred among couples in which the HIV-infected partner did not start antiretroviral therapy immediately.\nCohen cautioned that the findings don\u2019t apply to all HIV-positive people. \u201cOur couples had big advantages,\u201d he said. \n\u201cWe enrolled couples who probably have a low overall transmission [HIV] rate,\u201d he said. The researchers also made sure that the patients were taking their antiretroviral medications. \nAnd, the medications were carefully selected. \u201cThe drugs are important,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t use any combination possible \u2014 we used ones we thought would sterilise the genital tract,\u201d he said.\nCommenting on the study, Dr Alexis Powell, an assistant professor of infectious diseases at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, said that \u201cit\u2019s nice to finally have evidence-based information that clearly shows that earlier treatment with antiretrovirals can benefit the individual who is HIV-positive, but also protects sexual partners who are HIV-negative.\u201d\nMost doctors would like to treat HIV patients sooner, Powell said. \u201cWe clearly understand that patients benefit with earlier treatment,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd this is another reason to start early.\u201d\nBarriers\nPowell said she\u2019d like to put HIV patients on antiretrovirals as soon as they are diagnosed, but there are barriers. \nThey include criteria for treatment set by insurance companies, lack of funding and convincing some HIV-positive people to take the drugs. \nSome are reluctant to start taking medications that they will have to take for the rest of their lives, while others are wary of side effects.\nSome people think the drugs make you sicker than the virus. And still others distrust the medical system to act in their best interest, Powell said.\nShe cautioned that the study findings do not mean that people can stop practising safe sex. Men, especially, need to use a condom to protect themselves or their partners, Powell said. \n(NYT)"}
