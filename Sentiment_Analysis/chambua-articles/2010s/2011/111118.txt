{"text": "Boarding school pupils get more sex, study shows \nBy NATION REPORTER\nStudents in boarding schools have more sex and drink higher quantities of alcohol than those in day ones, a new study has revealed. \nThe study by the Students\u2019 Campaign Against Drugs revealed that 36 per cent of students in boarding schools and 35 per cent from day ones engage in pre-marital sex. \nThe study also established that more males students (23.5 per cent) are currently taking alcohol compared to females students (13.2 per cent). \nOver 1,470 students aged between 14-18 years participated in the study which was released on Thursday. \nNational Campaign Against Drug Abuse chairman Frank Njenga attributed the high number of boarding school students engaging in the vices to lack of parental supervision. \nDay students interact with their parents more, minimising their probability of engaging in the vices. \n\u201cWe are headed the Mexican or the Columbian way,\u201d Dr Njenga said of the country\u2019s growing drug trade. \nScad Chairman Caroline Kisia said 46.6 per cent of those who participated in the study are day scholars, 46.4 per cent boarders while the rest are in mixed schools.\nMore in Section Muslim cleric awarded Sh670,000 over seized property \nMore in Section Dinner with Champions \nadvertisement \nAdvertisement \nMost Popular\n\uf0b7  1 News Baby smashed to death on floor \n\uf0b7  2 Showbiz Eric Omondi pulls prank on fans with Lupita look-alike \n\uf0b7  3 News 7 days to road crisis \n\uf0b7  4 Eldoret Moi Girls principal charged with abuse of office \n\uf0b7  5 Africa Kenya orders all refugees into designated camps \n\uf0b7  6 News Design of buses blamed for deaths \n\uf0b7  7 News Wife recalls last talk with husband \n\uf0b7  8 Politics MPs bar Cabinet Secretaries from flying flags \n\uf0b7  9 Showbiz Nazizi\u2019s ex finally speaks out \n\uf0b7  10 Living Why did you try to kill us?
