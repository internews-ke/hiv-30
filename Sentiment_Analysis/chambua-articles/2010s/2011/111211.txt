{"text": "December 11,\u00a02011\nStill no care for HIV drugs fraud victims \nBy GATONYE GATHURA ggathura@ke.natiomedia.com\nHundreds of HIV patients who may have been exposed to suspect medicines are yet to receive medical care and nobody has been arrested for the crime that was exposed in September.\nM\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) said by the beginning of this month, it had not yet reached about 600 people, most of them in Homa Bay, who may have been exposed to the drugs.\nThe Pharmacy and Poisons Board says apart from discoloured, the drugs are safe.\nMSF, which first raised the alarm, says it has reached about 3,000 patients and replaced the suspect drugs. (READ: Beware: Fake HIV drugs on sale)\nAlthough the people who sold the medicine, Zidolum-N, to the MSF are well known, Pharmacy and Poisons Board head Dr Kipkerich Koskei says investigations are still going on.\n\u201cApart from being discoloured and of poor physical presentation, the drugs have been verified to be safe. However, we have presented the case to the police,\u201d he said.\nKenyans have in the last year been exposed to numerous health risks with the relevant authorities choosing to keep quiet.\nFor example, although the Pharmacy and Poisons Board had, for almost a month, been informed of the falsified Zidolam-N, it did not warn the public until the World Health Organisation issued an alert.\nThe Zidolam-N saga came soon after an audit by the Efficiency Monitoring Unit in the Prime Minister\u2019s office accused the Pharmacy and Poisons Board of allowing dangerous drugs into the market after they failed quality tests.\nThe board, which is mandated with ensuring that medicines sold in the country meet set standards, has been accused of allowing registration of drugs after they failed safety tests at the National Quality Control Laboratory (NQCL). \nEven after evidence had been presented and the NQCL confirmed this to be true to the Parliamentary committee on health, the board went on to buy space in the media defending the products in question."}
