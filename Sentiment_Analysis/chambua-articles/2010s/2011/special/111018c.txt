{"text": "Family planning method that 'raises risk of HIV'\n\nThe eye of the storm: The World\nHealth Organisation has convened a\nmeeting to discuss the findings of a\nresearch that links popular hormonal\ncontraceptive Depo-Provera to\na higher risk of HIV transmission\nbetween couples. Health experts,\nhowever, say there is no proven\nscientific connection in the claims,\nand that somebody is taking the\ncondom business a bit too far. Will\npharmaceutical giant Pfizer survive\nthis onslaught? What about the\nmillions of women on the drug?\nBY EDITH FORTUNATE\nefortunate@ke.nationmedia.com\nA recent report that linked\ninjectable family planning\nmethods to increased HIV\ninfection \"was nothing but\na ploy by condom manufacturers to\nsell more of their products\", health\nexperts have said.\nThe report, published in the health\njournal Lancet Infectious Disease,\nindicates that continued use of\nDepo-Provera exposes women to a\nhigher risk of HIV infection, and that\nthe best way to shut out the virus is\nto go the dual protection way - that\nis, to use Depo*Provera, a hormonal\ncontraceptive, and condoms at the\nsame time.\nHealth experts, however, have\ndismissed the recommendations of\nthe report, saying there is no proved\nscientific link between HIV and DepoProvera.\nProf Joseph Karanja, chairperson\nof Kenya Obstetrician Gynaecologist\nSociety (KOGS), told DN2 last week\nthat hormonal contraceptives are still\nsafer than condoms, and that \"unless\nthere is a scientific link (to the claims\nadvanced in the report), I do not see\nany cause for worry\".\nWhen you are prone to HIV:' Prof\nKaranja added, \"you definitely will\nhave to use condoms and hormonal\ncontraceptives at the same time. This\nis what we call 'dual protection' because\ncondoms alone are not enough\nsurety against unwanted pregnancies,\neven though they are highiy effective\nin the prevention of transmission of\ndiseases?'\nCountries where pregnancy rates\nare highest are also ravaged by HIV,\nthe virus that causes AIDS. So the evidence suggesting that the injectable\ncontraceptive has biological proper\u00b7\nties that may make women and men\nmore vulnerable to HIV infection is\nparticularly troubling.\nInjectable hormones are very popular. About 12 million women between\nthe ages of 15 and 49 in sub-Saharan\nAfrica, roughly 6 per cent of all women\nin that age group, use them.\nWhile the study involved only\nAfrican women, the New York Times\nreported, Scientists said biological\neffects would probably be the same\nfor all women. But they emphasized\nthat concern was greatest in Africa\nbecause the risk of HIV transmission\nfrom heterosexual sex was so much\nhigher there than elsewhere. 'The\nbest contraception today is injectable\nhormonal contraception because you\ndon't need a doctor, it's long-lasting, it\nenables women to control timing and\nspacing of birth without a lot of fuss\nandtravel;' said Isobel Coleman, director\nof the women and foreign policy\nprogranune at the Council on Foreign\nRelations in the US. It is now proven\nthat these contraception are helping\nspread the AIDS epidemic, we have a\nmajor health crisis on our hands.\"\nThe study, which several experts\nsaid added significant heft to previous\nresearch while still having some limitations,\nhas prompted the World Health\nOrganization to convene a meeting in\nJanuary to consider if evidence is now\nstrong enough to advise women that\nthe method may increase their risk of\ngetting or transmitting HIV.\nuWe are going to re-evaluate WHO's\nclinical recommendations on contraceptive\nuse;' said Mary Lyn Gaffield,\nan epidemiologist in the World Health\nOrganization's department of reproductive\nhealth and research.\nBefore the meeting, scientists will\nreview research concerning hormonal\ncontraceptives and women's risk\nof acquiring HIV, transmitting it to\nmen, and the possibility that hormonal contraceptives accelerate HIV's\nseverity in infected women, The New\nYork Times reported.\n\"We want to make sure that we warn\nwhen there is a real need to warn, but\nat the same time we don't want to come\nup with a hasty judgment that would\nhave far-reaching severe consequences\nfor the sexual and reproductive health\nof women,\" she said. \"This is a very\ndifficult dilemma!'\nThe study involved 3,800 couples\nin Botswana, Kenya, Rwanda, South\nAfrica, Tanzania, Uganda and Zarn-\nIt is important that all clients seeking family\nplanning services are assessed with regard\nto their risk of STls, including HIV/Alds, remembering\nthat all persons at risk of getting\ninfected with an STI are also at risk of getting\ninfected with HIV.

Researchers followed most\ncouples for two years, had them report\ntheir contraception methods,\nand tracked whether the uninfected\npartner contracted HIV from the infected\npartner.\nPfizer, the manufacturer of the\nbranded version of the injectable,\nDepo\u00b7Provera, declined to comment\non the study, saying officials had not\nyet read it.\nAccording to the Kenya Demo\u00b7\ngraphic Health Survey (2008-2009),\nthe current contraceptive prevalence\nrate for married women aged between\n15 and 49 is slightly less than half (46\nper cent).\nModem methods of contraception\nare more commonly used 09 per cent)\nthan traditional methods (6 per cent).\nOf the modem methods, injectables\nare the most widely used, while the\nrhythm method is the most popular\ntraditioual method.\nIn a paid-for advert in the papers last\nweek, Dr Shariff Shahnaz, the Director\nof Public Health, said his department\nwas already advising dual protection\nmethods to couples at a higher risk of\nHIV infection. ....\n\"It is important to note that other\nthan the male and female condom,\" Dr\n\n\n\n140 ,000,000\nNumber of women globally who take hormonal contraceptive methods,\nincluding daily oral pills and long-acting injectables.
