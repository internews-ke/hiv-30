{"text": "May 31,\u00a02011\nHIV 30 years on \nBy AFP\nOn June 5, 1981, American epidemiologists reported a baffling event: five young gay men in Los Angeles, all previously healthy, had fallen ill with pneumonia. Two had died.\nThey would be the first casualties of a new virus which has now claimed more lives than a world war.\nNearly 30 million people have been killed by acquired immune deficiency syndrome (Aids) and more than 33 million others have the virus that causes it.\nA disease that began as a medical curiosity has spread across the world, its tentacles reaching into every corner of society.\nDeath, sickness and stigma are the hallmarks of its tale. But so are dazzling medical exploits, unexpected solidarity and smashed taboos.\n\u201cAids has changed the world, without any doubt,\u201d Michel Sidibe, executive director of UNAIDS, said ahead of the UN\u2019s June 8-10 high-level AIDS forum in New York.\n\u201cWe have been able to break a conspiracy of silence,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd a new social compact has been created between the north and the south, which has never happened before with any disease of this kind.\u201d\nThe early years of the Aids war are a dark chapter of fear, ignorance and homophobia.\nBut the term \u201cgay plague\u201d swiftly faded when it was found Aids could also be contracted through blood transfusion and heterosexual intercourse and from an infected mother to her unborn child.\nMercifully, the fight against Aids began almost instantly, thanks to gay groups who lobbied for research funds in the United States and campaigned against stigma and for safe sex.\nAs swiftly as 1983, French doctors pinpointed the cause: a pathogen which became known as the human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV).\nTransmitted in semen, vaginal secretions, breast milk or blood, HIV hijacks key immune cells to reproduce itself, destroying the cell in the process.\nAfter about half a dozen years that can be symptom-free, the immune system becomes so weak that the body becomes fatally exposed to TB, pneumonia and other opportune microbes.\nIdentifying HIV led to a test to help identify those infected and weed out contaminated blood samples. It also unleashed optimism that in a couple of years a vaccine would be found, just as it had been found for smallpox and polio.\nBut the world is still waiting. The virus has so far eluded the vaccine engineers, for it comes with a slippery sugary coating and an astonishing ability to mutate.\nWith no vaccine, cure or treatment in sight, the death toll from Aids mounted nightmarishly in the 1980s and 90s. \nNewspaper headlines remembered the actors, rock stars and sporting heroes \u2014 Rock Hudson, Freddy Mercury, Arthur Ashe \u2014 but the millions of non-celebrity victims went unrecorded.\n\u201cI walked into the women\u2019s ward for general medicine. The women were all wasted, emaciated and dying,\u201d Peter Piot, Sidibe\u2019s predecessor, recalled of his grim experience as a doctor in Africa in 1983.\n\u201cI said to myself, \u2018Oh my God, this is a catastrophe!\u2019 It was a moment of realisation. It changed my life.\u201d\nIn 1996 came the great news: the first effective anti-HIV drugs were available at last.\nThe \u201ccocktail\u201d represses HIV to below detectable levels, although it is not a cure and can have hefty side-effects.\nAs their immune system miraculously rebounded, people who had literally been under a death sentence returned to life.\nBut the previous drugs were so expensive that for half a dozen years, only rich countries could afford them. \nToday, more than five million people in low- and middle-income have grasped the lifeline, but 10 million more await treatment, according to UNAIDS.\nBy 2015 \u2014 when the UN has set a target of \u201czero new infections, zero discrimination and zero deaths\u201d \u2014 it will be 13 million.\nThere lies a dilemma: the more lives that are saved, the more money that is needed, for the drugs have to be taken every day for the rest of one\u2019s life.\nBy 2015, an additional six billion dollars will be needed, which points to the need for innovative financing and help from China and other emerging giants.\n\u201cWe have got to stop the transmission of the virus, otherwise it is impossible, impossible to conceive of treating your way out of the epidemic or even treating all the people who need to be treated,\u201d said Seth Berkley, head of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI).\nA campaign is underway in Africa to promote male circumcision, found to reduce the infection risk to men by two-thirds.\nEven more dramatic is a new study, conducted among heterosexual couples, that says anti-HIV drugs, if taken early to treat an infected person, can reduce the risk of viral transmission to a non-infected partner by 96 per cent."}
