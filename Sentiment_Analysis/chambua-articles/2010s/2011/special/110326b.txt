{"text": "March 26,\u00a02011\nLoliondo pilgrimage marred by deaths and accidents \n0 \nBy ZEPHANIA UBWANI IN ARUSHA ubwanizg@gmail.com\nThe Tanzanian government has confirmed that six people have died as they tried to reach or after they left Loliondo in northern Tanzania for the wonder drug promised by a local faith healer.\nNgorongoro\u00a0 District Commissioner Elias Wawa Lali told the Sunday Nation that the six died on March 8. Five of them died on the queue while the fifth, a child, was crushed by a vehicle he was under when the parents went for the liquid concoction.\nThe Citizen team that returned from Samunge village early this week counted five bodies.\nHowever, a section of the Tanzanian media has reported bigger death figures, 10 of which are reported to have occurred last weekend alone.\nPeople who died are mostly those taken straight from their hospital beds while in critical condition and taken to Loliondo for the miracle cure. They include those suffering from HIV/Aids-related ailments.\nDeaths have also been attributed to exhaustion with the sick sometimes having to spend days queuing, travelling to the remote areas on nearly impassable roads or getting stranded on the way. Clean water, food, medicine are not readily available.\nTraffic accidents have claimed at least eight lives and scores injured, some critically, in the area according to police reports.\nAccommodation has been a problem but in recent days clever people have taken big tents to the area which they rent at high fees. Other people spend nights in their vans or outside in the cold.\nThe pilgrims normally start their journey from Arusha between 9 p.m. and midnight, arriving at Samunge in the morning, spend the whole day in the queue and after reaching the healer take another night before returning.\nOn Saturday, the Tanzanian government did not announce measures to stem the humanitarian crisis likely to develop in Loliondo after the miracle healer apparently stopped the exercise.\nThe Rev Ambilikile Mwasapile, whose clinic has attracted thousands seeking his herbal concoction, is reported to have called senior government officials in Arusha and urged them to hold on until he made public his stand on the issue.\nHordes of journalists based here converged at the district commissioner\u2019s office early on Saturday to hear the government verdict on the crisis but were told steps to be taken would be announced after further consultations with the healer.\n\u201cUnfortunately there will be no briefing on what measures the government intends to take as we promised you yesterday (Friday),\u201d said Mr Lali.\nHe noted the exercise had to be called off following communication received late on Friday in which the healer pleaded his \u00a0position on the matter should precede the government\u2019s announcement.\n\u201cHe [the healer] insisted that before the government announces any measures, he be given a chance to issue his statement on how best he thought the crisis should be handled,\u201d the DC explained, declining further details.\nMr Lali later left with scores of journalists to the remote Samunge village.\nHe said contacts made with the healer indicated he preferred to make his stand known through a media briefing that the old man himself was expected to convene in his village on Saturday.\nThe spiritual healer\u2019s decision would immediately be communicated to other government leaders, including the Minister of \u00a0State in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office William Lukuvi who until Saturday was still in Arusha to monitor the crisis.\nThe minister has been in Arusha since Wednesday consulting leaders from the northern regions over the looming humanitarian catastrophe in Loliondo following the influx of people there for herbal treatment.\nOn Wednesday, he chaired a crisis meeting of leaders from six regions and admitted the authorities were cautious on handling the issue because the treatment offered there was mainly faith-based.\nMr Lukuvi reiterated earlier government position not to close the healer\u2019s clinic but expressed his concern about the plight of sick people ferried there for treatment, poor sanitation and security."}
