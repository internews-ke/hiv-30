{"text": "Kenya Battles Huge Funding Gap In Aids Treatment Plans\n\n31 March 2013\nBY\u00a0ARTHUR OKWEMBA\nThe funding situation does not look good for Kenya with a huge funding gap remaining even after the combined funding from the approved Round 7 of the Global Fund, Pepfar and Clinton HIV/Aids initiative.\nIn the year 2010/2011, the country needs Sh7.8 billion to manage over 540,000 adult and children on ARV treatment.\nIt can raise only Sh5 billion from the three sources, leaving a funding gap of about Sh2.5 billion.\nIn 2011/2012, ARV treatment programme is projected to cost over Sh10 billion to manage about 680,000 patients.\nOnly Sh 4.5 billion is assured from development partners, leaving a gaping Sh6 billion hole.\nFor the year 2012/2013, the projected ARV cost for 770,000 people is Sh12 billion, but only Sh4.5 billion is assured from Round 7, Pepfar and Clinton initiative put together.\nNew sources need to be found to bridge the gap. For now, what is going to sustain the HIV treatment programmes is the funding from the Global Funding Round 7 that ends in 2012, the Pepfar funds and government.\nMoney from Global Fund\u2019s Round 10 approved in December last year, is also expected to help narrow that gap.\nThe funds are critical particularly starting this year as the government shifts patients from Stavudine to the less toxic tenofovir drug in line with the WHO guidelines.\nTreatment programmes are further expected to start aggressive use of laboratory to monitor CD4 count and viral load as well as initiating antiretroviral therapy to HIV positive patients who have active TB and chronic active hepatitis B irrespective of their CD4 cell count.\nSuch interventions are expected to improve the quality of life of people living with HIV."}
