{"text": "RESEARCH\nHIV babies\nliving longer,\nsays study\nMost children born with HIV infection now survive into adulthood,\na markedly different prognosis\nfrom the near-certain death that\nawaited HIV-infected babies years\nago, researchers report.\nResearchers are tracking children with HIV, the AIDS-causing\nvirus, to better understand the effects\nof treatment and identify possible\ncomplications.\n\"About two thirds of these kids,\nat this point, don't have virus\ndetectable in the blood:' Tulane\nUniversity infectious diseases expert\nDr Russell Van Dyke said in\na university news release. '''While\nthey are still infected and they are\nnot cured, it's surprising how well\nthey're doing, considering what\nthey've been through?'\nHowever, with longer survival,\nnew issues arise. \"We're not seeing\nthe deaths we used to see due\nto infections, but we're starting to\nworry about longer-term complications,\"\nVan Dyke said. The complications\ninclude coronary artery\ndisease and cognitive problems.\nStill, Van Dyke said the patients\nin the study should have normal\nlife spans or at least near-normal.\nThat's a sign that HIV/AIDS is becoming\na chronic disease, not an\nalways-deadly one.
