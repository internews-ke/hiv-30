{"text": "July 11,\u00a02011\nMy dear men, living a double life is not worth it \nAs Kenya and the rest of the world commemorated having made tremendous strides in the fight against HIV/AIDS in the last 30 years, I could not help reflecting on what I have contributed towards this fight. \nNot to toot my own horn, but I\u2019m sure that in my own way, I have inspired many women living with this virus to live positively.\nHowever, one thing remains elusive to me - how to deal with men who are HIV-infected, because most of them seem to operate from a different planet. Mars perhaps? \nThe case of Simon* easily comes to mind. When I met this gentleman about three years ago, he had just recently tested HIV positive and having read about me in the media, he wanted to know how he too could cope with the virus for the rest of his life. \nInitially, when the 47-year-old gentleman walked into my office, I had no idea what he was up to. I thought he was an insurance broker, (nothing personal, but I don\u2019t like insurance brokers) who had wiggled his way into my office.\nI was prepared with my classic put-downer: \u201cSorry. I\u2019ve just signed on the dotted line a couple of hours ago.\u201d\nBut nope, Simon had come to see what he required to do so, in his own words, \u201clead a long life as you\u2019ve done\u201d. \nAs you may know by now, of course, there is no single thing or formula that can be done to improve the life of a person living with HIV, rather, it requires a combination of factors. \nI did my best, or so I thought, as I explained to him important things like diet, healthy lifestyle, and taking antiretroviral drugs, which he was already getting from a private, and expensive hospital, though he could afford it.\nI told him everything that I knew, and I can tell you that I went into the details. When I was through, I asked him if he had questions.\nI was rather surprised when he said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I think now I have a rough idea of what it\u2019s like\u201d. \nHe confessed to me that he had been unfaithful to his wife, and had no intention of telling her about his HIV status, since he was convinced that she would desert him. \nAlthough I emphasised the importance of his wife knowing his HIV status, I did not dwell on this revelation, since, at that moment, I first had to ensure that he was capable of handling his HIV status. \nAgain, I was surprised by what he told me, when I explained why he had to come clean with his wife: \u201cAsunta, what makes you think my wife is the closest person in my life? She\u2019 not ... we emotionally parted long ago.\u201d\n\u201cActually, the person I\u2019m worried about, and who gives me sleepless nights is our house help. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve been together for as long as I can remember and she\u2019s closer to me than my wife.\n\u201cBesides, we have two sons together. I\u2019m worried about who will take care of them if I die of AIDS.\u201d\nI was caught off guard by this revelation, and for a moment, I did not know what to say.\nThe following day, Simon came to my office with their house girl, who too had tested HIV positive. \nI tried not to convey any negative attitude or judgement, but it was difficult, and I reckon that he could read where I stood from my facial expressions. \nLater, I referred them to the support group for monthly meetings and psycho-social support, and kept their personal information to myself. \nI\u2019m not sure it was the right approach, but then again, it\u2019s the people who had sought help from me that mattered, not what I thought was the ideal manner people should behave. \nI was not too surprised when, not long ago, the house help called me and informed me that Simon had succumbed to AIDS-related complications. I\u2019m yet to know one thing: what do some men really want?\nSimon had everything he required to add days to his life, and not only mere days, but quality-packed days, yet he did not get there. \nBut I was on the outside looking in \u2013 a perfect stranger, so to speak \u2013 and I was not privy to everything that was happening in his marriage. \nIn my view, the house help, though the spoiler, emerged with the spoils. I learnt that she had been left with a good chunk of Simon\u2019s wealth, thanks to a will that he had written before his death.\nI can imagine the shocker that greeted the official widow when she learnt about her husband\u2019s deception. I really hope that she was fortunate enough to have escaped HIV infection.\nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother of three who tested HIV-positive 24 years ago.
