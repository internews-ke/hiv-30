{"text": "October 9,\u00a02011\nLet\u2019s not concentrate on lifestyle diseases \nA significant shift in the management of diseases, similar to what happened with the advent of HIV in the 1980s, is taking place in Kenya.\nBy the middle of 1980, the reality of HIV was met with skepticism and denial, but this was soon replaced by a general panic mainly created by alarmist information and rumours.\nThis deflected almost all attention to the new menace at the expense of other medical programmes. \nThe programme that suffered most was family planning, and it has never really recovered.\nBut with HIV becoming more manageable, donors like the US and Britain have indicated a shift that strips the diseases of its special status.\nThe reasons advocated for treating HIV alongside other medical conditions are quite sound, but this transition must be managed based on country needs rather than what donors are willing to fund.\nKenya is suffering from the double tragedy of a high rate of infectious diseases and an increasing incidence of lifestyle conditions, with a real danger that the latter could hijack attention and funding.\nThis must not be allowed to happen because communicable, maternal, perinatal and nutritional diseases continue to be the biggest killers. Luckily, updated data for medical planners is available.\nRecently, the World Health Organisation indicated that these conditions accounted for 62 per cent of all deaths annually compared to 28 per cent caused by lifestyle diseases.\nBut figures quoted twice within last week by the Public Health minister Beth Mugo, indicate that lifestyle diseases are responsible for 50 per cent of all deaths annually.\nThis is a statistically significant difference that may require harmonisation so the country gets the planning fundamentals right from the beginning."}
