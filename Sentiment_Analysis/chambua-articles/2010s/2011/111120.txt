{"text": "November 30,\u00a02011\nLet\u2019s toast to zero Aids-related deaths\nBy ASUNTA WAGURA\n\u201cGetting to Zero.\u201d This is the theme of this year\u2019s World Aids Day, which was announced in Cape Town, South Africa, on 5 September. \nWorld Aids Day this year is preaching Zero New HIV Infections, Zero Discrimination, and Zero Aids-Related Deaths. \nBacked by the United Nations, the \u201cGetting to Zero\u201d campaign runs until 2015 and builds on last year\u2019s successful World Aids Day\u2019s \u201cLight for Rights\u201d initiative, encompassing a range of vital issues identified by key affected populations. \nAs we progress towards this inspirational goal, I can attest to the reality of it, having lived for 25 years with HIV and given birth to two boys who\u00a0have not contracted HIV from me. \nBut I want assurance that even as they live their lives, they will live in an HIV-free environment, hence the need for the three zeros theme for this world Aids day.\nFor starters, getting to zero HIV infections will not be a walk in the park. I\u2019m not being a fatalist; I\u2019m just keeping it real.\nIf, as a country, we have to get to zero HIV infections \u2014 and I know we can \u2014 we have to change our attitudes and behaviour. \nNowadays, it seems that people treat HIV casually, which makes our work cut out for us. \nI\u2019m not saying that we should treat HIV with the skull-and-cross bones mindset that we used to years ago.\nAll I\u2019m saying is that HIV is a real pain in the backside. Remember, I\u2019ve been there, done that, got the T-shirt. \nIt is not something to joke about or play hit-or-miss with, like some people are wont to; having casual sex, and thinking they are untouchable because they have not tested HIV-positive. \nI have told you before how I am afraid for my eldest son, Peter. \nI know I should not be, but I am a mother and I know what HIV can do to one\u2019s life. \nPeter has seen what HIV can do \u2014 he has been an eyewitness, and I hope to God that he will use these lessons to avoid the pitfalls that befall so many other young men in our country. \nAbout zero HIV discrimination, methinks that we are getting there, but we have to keep the rubber on the tarmac and not remove our foot from the accelerator. \nYes, times have changed and people living with HIV have more acceptance now than they had decades ago when I tested positive. \nAlthough we have almost won this public battle, the fiercest battles for any person living with HIV are the ones we fight with ourselves, in our secret places, when the curtains are drawn and the world is shut out. \nFor some of us, especially those who have tested HIV-positive only recently, we discriminate against ourselves and behave as if we are now second-class citizens. \nBack to getting to zero Aids-related deaths \u2014 these too will not be achieved without a fight. And then some.\nI am not in any way belittling the great strides that have been made to make sure that HIV-positive people have universal access to care and support. \nIt may seem like just the right time, but this is not the time to pause on our oars because lives are involved. \nWith each step that we take, and each court battle that we win, we are guaranteeing, for instance, that one child will have a mother, and a shot at a better life. \nRecently, the government announced that there are plans to reduce the price of antiretroviral drugs, which means that we will have more HIV-positive people on treatment, a factor that further means that we are getting real close to zero Aids-related deaths. \nStill, we have to take it upon ourselves to begin treatment on time and not wait until it is too late, when HIV has wreaked havoc on almost every sinew of our body. \nI know this has something to do with acceptance, but it still irks me when I see an HIV-positive person waiting \u2014 and waiting \u2014 and coming for help when it is almost too late to do anything but make sure they die in dignity. \nIt starts with me, with the girl in the mirror. Everything from zero new HIV infections, to zero discrimination, to zero Aids-related deaths starts with me. \nAnd it starts with me swearing, meaning it, that this World Aids Day, and every single day afterwards, there will be \u2014 say it together with me \u2014 \u201cZero New HIV Infections, Zero Discrimination, and Zero Aids-Related Deaths.\u201d \nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother-of-three who tested HIV-positive 24 years ago.
