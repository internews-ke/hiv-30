{"text": "New TB test kit comes to Kenya in 3 months\nMarch 29, 2011 \nThe latest tuberculosis testing technology, which confirms results as you wait, will be available in Kenya in the next three months.\nThe computer-enabled equipment produces results in 100 minutes instead of the six weeks the current technology requires.\nEndorsed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in December, the test can also detect drug resistance to TB, which is on the increase in the country.\nMs Judy Waguma of M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) said the first kits would be available at the organisation\u2019s clinics in Kibera, Homa Bay and Mathare.\nThe government also plans to bring in more test machines before the end of the year.\nEach machine costs about Sh1.38 million but WHO has promised to negotiate a lower price for low and middle-income countries like Kenya.\nKenya ranks 13th on the list of 22 high-burden TB countries in the world and has the fifth highest burden in Africa. According to WHO\u2019s Global TB Report 2009, Kenya had approximately more than 132,000 new TB cases and an incidence rate of 142 new cases per 100,000 population.\nDr Joseph Sitienei, the head of Kenya\u2019s Division of Leprosy, TB and Lung Diseases, said by last year there were 30 cases of Multi-Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) which have been cured \u2014 16 at two public health facilities, and 14 by the MSF.\nSo far, the country has identified about 552 MDR-TB cases which have been confirmed, but only 112 are on treatment programmes at Kenyatta National Hospital, Moi Referral and Training Hospital in Eldoret, the MSF facility in Mathare, Nairobi, and at Homa Bay in Nyanza.\nAccording to MSF, the cost of some of the medicines required to treat drug resistance TB has increased 800-fold in the last decade despite being old drugs with serious side effects.\n\u201cHowever, these are the only medicines that exist today that can tackle drug resistance TB. Our reports shows that these drugs are riddled with persistent supply and price problems that must be urgently addressed,\u201d says Dr Tido von Schoen-Angerer of MSF.\nA 24-month drug resistant treatment regimen can cost as much as Sh750,000 for a patient, 470 times more than the cost of curing standard, drug-sensitive TB.\nBut the TB solution may lie with 64 infants from Siaya in Nyanza participating in Phase II of tuberculosis vaccine clinical trials.\nDr Grace Kiringa, the study coordinator said they were evaluating the safety of a vaccine called AERAS-402/Crucell Ad35.\n\u201cIn previous studies done on healthy adults, adults living with HIV and on healthy infants, no serious adverse events have been reported. And so, to the best of our knowledge, the vaccine is safe. This is extremely promising and critical to finding a new vaccine that will help put an end to the TB epidemic,\u201d she told Africa Science News Service recent"}
