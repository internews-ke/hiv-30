{"text": "June 1,\u00a02010\nLearning from each other\u2019s experiences\nBy ASUNTA WAGURA\nThe other day, my friends and I were looking back at just how far we have come and we all agreed that nowadays, it not Aids per se that is killing people; it\u2019s ignorance and procrastination sending people to an early grave. \nBecause of the work our people are doing on the ground, it is hard to find a person bedridden because of HIV-related complications. \n\u201cThe funny thing is that it\u2019s in the slums that you won\u2019t find bedridden clients,\u201d someone else shared her experience.\n\u201cBut in some estates, especially the high-rise concrete buildings, you\u2019ll find that someone has locked herself in and the neighbours don\u2019t care what goes on inside the person\u2019s four walls.\u201d \nI concur. In my work with people infected with, and affected by HIV, I\u2019ve found out that people who live in resource-scarce settings are the most receptive to our gospel of living positively. That is why our organisation has centred all its activities in informal settlements. And the results are encouraging. \nStill, there was a time when some of them did not even want to see our organisation\u2019s vehicles \u2014 a dead giveaway to the type of work we do \u2014 parked near their homes, even when we were bringing them glad tidings. After understanding that we were on their side, they finally allowed us into their lives. \n\u201cI\u2019ve since opened up and I\u2019m not afraid to wear a T-shirt with the words, \u2018HIV-positive\u2019 printed on it,\u201d another friend chipped in, adding that her initial fear of our organisation\u2019s workers and vehicles subsid after our counsellors took her through the paces of positive living. \nOur members who live in informal settlements will not hide if something is troubling them when they know they can get help from us.\nFrom medication, to emotional support, to paying school fees for orphans and vulnerable children, these folks will, if need be, shout from the rooftops for help. \nWe don\u2019t have answers to all their problems, but they epitomise the adage, \u201cA problem shared is a problem halved.\u201d \nI can\u2019t say the same for most middle-class people. And let me hasten to add that I have lots of friends who fall in this category. At the beginning I talked about how far we\u2019ve come \u2014 and I would like to clarify that the \u201cwe\u201d here refers to middle-class, folks \u2014 and we still have a long way to go. \nSomeone once told me that the issue of HIV cannot be solved by throwing money at it. And, unfortunately, that\u2019s what most middle-class folks do; throw their legal tender at the problem, thinking this will make it go away.\n\u201cThe best hospital care that money can buy, without hooking one with a support group, will not produce the desired results,\u201d one of my friends who is a community health worker commiserated, sharing how the persistence of other sisters living with HIV was what got her out of the rut of self-stigma and ignorance. \nAnd in some medical institutions, there\u2019s a disconnect between provision of healthcare and provision of life skills. I have been to hospitals where an HIV-positive person is started on medication, then left to take care of themselves. \nYet, anyone on HIV medication will tell you that having a \u201ctreatment buddy\u201d is the difference between drug adherence and a patient falling off the antiretroviral therapy train. \nSo, the best bet for anyone living with HIV \u2014 whether financially able or living on less than a dollar a day \u2014 is to find a support group, another hearth and home. And do it fast. \nI have found out that women living with HIV in the slums do not have the superficial obstacled that some of us have erected on each other\u2019s paths. \nThey will knock on your door if they as much as sense that you are living with HIV, but are afraid to ask for help. When push comes to shove, some of the community health workers in the informal settlement areas will drag you out of bed and take you to hospital. \nI might have all the CDs, books and magazines \u2013 (plus, at the touch of a mouse I can access thousands of literature) \u2013 but I have learnt a lot from other people who are living with HIV who share their experiences with me. \nThey are reservoirs of knowledge. We may be poles apart socio-economically, but their diverse individual experiences give me ideas about how to handle certain situations in my life, some that are not found in CDs, books and magazines.\nasuntawagura@hotmail.com \nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother of two who tested positive 23 years ago.
