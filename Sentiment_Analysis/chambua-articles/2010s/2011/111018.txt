File I\nPatients who have been exposed to fake and poor quality HIV medicines may have to wait longer before they can know whether the products contained any harmful substances.\n\u00a0\u2028\u2028\u2028The Pharmacy and Poisons Board (PPB) had promised to make known results of suspect samples by the first week of this month, but by Friday it had neither compiled nor released the final results.\nAccording to Dr Jacinta Wasike, the board\u2019s director of inspection and surveillance, they were still waiting for some results from a private laboratory.\n\u201cThe lab results from the National Quality Control Labs\u00a0are out, but we are still waiting for some more results,\u201d she said in an email.\nLast month, the Pharmacy and Poisons Board confirmed that falsified Zidolam-N tablets had been found in Kenya in various degrees of deterioration, including moulding, discolouration and breakages.\nIn a statement, the board said it had collected samples of the suspect product and sent them to several laboratories for detailed chemical analysis and promised that the findings would be out by the first week of this month.\nSince then more falsified products have been discovered while several other organisations have come out calling on Kenyans who may be in possession of the suspect medicines to return them.\nThe board has also refused to comment on whether those responsible for the falsification and distribution of the drugs had been identified or arrested, saying the issue is being handled by the police.\u2028\u2028One of the organisations which had purchased and distributed the suspect medicines, Doctors Without Borders (MSF), says it is tracing patients who may have received the drugs and promised to offer them appropriate medical follow-up.\nWhen we contacted the Humanitarian Medical & Pharmaceuticals Purchasing Centre, a non-governmental organisation which supplies HIV medicines to MSF among other organisations, a man who identified himself only as Timothy said the issue was being handled by the Pharmacy and Poisons Board.\nPublic statement\nOn Thursday last week, the owners of the falsified medicine, Hetero Drugs Limited of India, issued a public statement urging anybody who may have in their possession the suspect products to return them to their doctors or point of collection.\nWhile assuring the public of the high quality of their products, Hetero said that some of the suspect batches found in the local market were actually never supplied to Kenya.\nContacted by the Nation last week, Mr Bhavesh Shah, Hetero\u2019s vice president for international operations, refused to discuss the issue claiming it is still under local and international investigations.\u2028\u2028"}
