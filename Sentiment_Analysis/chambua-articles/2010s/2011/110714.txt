It simply means taking a once\na day pill (Truvada or Tenofovir)\nreduces the risk of acquiring HIV\ninfection.\"\nThe study, carried out among 4.758\nHIV discordant couples - where one\npartner is HN positive - was done\nby KNH, Kenya Medical Research\nInstitute, Moi Teaching and Referral\nHospital and the University of\nWashington.
