Public Health Minister Beth Mugo dismissed the claim.\nDr Mulindi was speaking at the opening of a two-day forum for an HIV-Free Generation at a Nairobi hotel.\nMs Tijuana James-Traore, the associate director of the Partnership for an HIV-Free Generation (HFG), the organisation behind the campaign dubbed \u201cG-Pange\u201d, said plans were under way to educate the youth on the epidemic.\n\u201cWe have not reached the group in the way that we would like to,\u201d Ms James-Traore said.\nHFG country director Lydia Murimi said the fact that the top three fears of the youth, in order, are unemployment, pregnancy then HIV/Aids, heightens their willingness to take risks.\nThe initiative is now targeting young people aged between 10 and 24, through in-school and out-of-school anti-HIV campaigns, with the view of reducing the occurrence of the disease by 50 per cent by 2014."}
