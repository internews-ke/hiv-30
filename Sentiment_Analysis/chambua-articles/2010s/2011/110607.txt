{"text": "June 7,\u00a02011\nAre you living dangerously? \nWhen I went to driving school, the trainer used an old British school manual that is out of touch with the rules that govern our roads today. \nShould I go back for a refresher course, I will ask them quite a number of questions. \nOne of them would be why they left out matatus when listing the vehicles that we should give way to. \nThe way we hurriedly move out of the way when we spot one bearing down on us, I dare say matatus are in the same league as the presidential motorcade, fire engines, and ambulances. \nHere are my coward\u2019s tips that may help you to survive on Kenyan roads. They highly compare with living with HIV, where outwardly you feign courage, while inwardly you are shaking like a leaf in a gale. \nThere is one golden rule: Do whatever you have to do to avoid getting into an accident. Be warned, though, that this means that you will be swallowing tonnes of pride along the way as you leave the road to experienced bullies. \nThe silver rule is, never be annoyed by another motorist for more than 10 seconds because you will lose focus and do some crazy things \u2014 like giving bullies a piece of your mind. If you have passengers, carry the unprintable word forward, or just forget about it. \nIf you are a driver, ensure you are never caught in a traffic jam. And never drive past six o\u2019clock and ensure that you are home by sunset. \nBefore you overtake or overlap, ensure that there is no traffic cop and that the road is clear by at least half-a-kilometre. You don\u2019t want to be booked for dangerous driving. \nPlease, never overtake trucks, matatus, or buses. If you do it, it is at great risk. Also, never drive alongside the above vehicles at roundabouts because they will sandwich you and, for a couple of horrifying moments, you will see your life flash before you.\nIf you are like me, never drive on weekend nights. At this time you are likely to be hit by drunkards, mostly teenagers who have stolen their parents\u2019 vehicles to go partying. \nSo, ensure that you have enough supplies to last you the weekend. Hit the road only when it is absolutely necessary. \nYour vehicle should always be in perfect order; no red or coloured indicators on the dashboard. And that reminds me. \nWhen one of your side mirrors is plucked off, have a phone number of a driver who can risk driving a car with just one mirror. \nAs for cowards like me, we either drive with all mirrors or use a public service vehicle. When it rains, look for somewhere to park as you wait for the rain to subside. \nBecause of poor drainage, the roads flood and it becomes difficult to tell where the road starts and where it ends. You don\u2019t want to drive right into a ditch.\nTo avoid unnecessary embarrassment, avoid reversing anywhere in public, since you might not be perfect the way you think you are. \nHave a mechanic or two \u2014 and know their phones numbers off head \u2014 so that when your car develops mechanical problems, you won\u2019t have to endure the crazy stares and insults of road bullies. \nYour mechanic will help you out over the phone, or better, come to where you are and personally sort out your problem. \nI personally drive at what I call \u201cbora kufika\u201d kilometres per hour and, because of my snail\u2019s pace, my workmates avoid hitching a lift from me. \nKnowledge is power. After driving for some time, you know the risk of allowing anyone who has drunk even one bottle of beer to drive you. \nYou would rather drive yourself or leave the vehicle parked somewhere until the following day. Remember, on the road, cowards live longer.\nDid I hear you ask what message I\u2019m trying to pass a cross? This is it: the power to keep the HIV virus at bay is in your hands. \nYou know what to do and what not to do. Since you have this knowledge, then do everything in your power to ensure that you do not contract it.\nStay faithful to one partner, even if it is not fashionable. Your friends will make fun of your monogamy rule. \nAfter all, at least from what I hear on radio every morning, everyone is sleeping around, aren\u2019t they? But who says you have to conform to your peers\u2019 dangerous living? Why tempt fate?\nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother of three who tested HIV-positive 24 years ago.
