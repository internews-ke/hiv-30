{"text": "May 31,\u00a02011\n30 years on, HIV/Aids still a global medical mystery \nBy AFP\nThe race to end Aids has picked up momentum in the past two years as scientific advances offer new hope of halting the spread of the disease, nearly three decades after the epidemic surfaced.\nHuman immunodeficiency virus is well known to attack the body\u2019s natural defences, but it has proven such a wily foe over the past 30 years because of the way it transforms, replicates and hides inside the body.\nScientists are learning more about how the virus infiltrates cells, and how to harness the body\u2019s own natural defences to guard against it in the hope of closing in on new vaccines, strong prevention treatments and possibly, a cure.\n\u201cWe have seen the light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d said Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a long time leader in the fight to end Aids.\nAccording to Seth Berkley, president of the International Aids Vaccine Initiative, the \u201clast two years have been the most exciting\u201d because researchers have made the \u201cbiggest advances\u201d in vaccines and preventions.\nNeutralising antibodies\nHigh on the list is work on broadly neutralising antibodies, potent antibodies made by about 10-20 per cent of people who are simply born with better natural defences against HIV.\nScientists have now isolated 15 of these antibodies, and they are working backward to find ways to force the human immune system to produce them. When two are combined, they have been shown to block 90 per cent of known HIV strains.\n\u201cThe idea is if we could identify a strategy for the human host to be tricked into making broadly neutralising antibodies, that is a huge step toward making a vaccine,\u201d said Myron Cohen, a leading Aids researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\nThe use of drug therapy as a way to prevent HIV transmission has also gathered steam with a series of important clinical trials.\nIn early May, a global study of mainly heterosexual couples found a 96 per cent lower risk of transmission to the uninfected person when antiretroviral therapy (ART) was started before the illness advanced in the sick partner.\nIn November 2010, a landmark study across four continents showed that a daily dose of an oral antiretroviral pill, Truvada, reduced the number of HIV infections among sexually active gay men by 44 per cent.\nTargeting the tissues where transmission is most likely to occur has also been a promising area for researchers.\nThe use of antiretroviral gels applied vaginally or rectally have shown some positive effects toward prevention, and in 2006 a pair of trials in Africa showed that circumcised men were 48 and 53 percent less likely to become infected with HIV.\nGerman researchers made headlines last year with the news that an AIDS patient who received a bone marrow transplant to combat his leukaemia has remained virus free for three years, suggesting the first \u201ccure\u201d may have been achieved.\nEven though the so-called Berlin patient underwent a radical operation that is too risky for most to survive, researchers are carefully examining his case for clues as to how to block HIV from entering the cells.\nHe received a transplant from a donor with a rare genetic mutation that is naturally resistant to HIV. \nAbout one in 100 Caucasian people, or one per cent of the population, have the mutation, known as Delta 32, which prevents the protein CCR5 from appearing on the cell surface.\nSince HIV enters the cell through CCR5 molecules, when they are absent HIV cannot penetrate.\nWhile researchers say it will likely be another decade or two before a true cure may be found, they feel they are closing in on something big.\n\u201cWhen you put all those prevention models together and in combination, we are getting closer and closer to being able to say we may be able to turn this epidemic around,\u201d said Fauci."}
