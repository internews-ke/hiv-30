{"text": "We can't erase the past, but we can start afresh\nOne was a prostitute, another a stripper.\nToday, they're changed women, who,\neven though earning just a tiny fraction\nof what they would make in their old\nlives, are much happier\n\nBY FELISTA WANGARI\nfwangari\u00a7ke.nationmedia.com\nLike every young girl, Consolata\nAyako knew what she wanted to become\nwhen she grew up; a nurse. She fOWld\nnurses pleasant, their white uniforms\nelegant, and in her day dreams, she pic\u00b7\ntured herself in such attire.\nAs she grew up, though, this vivid dream\nstarted to fade as her life took a different\npath. Instead of taking care of the sick\nand nursing them back to health, she\nfound herself in a \"career\" that she never\nwould have imagined - strip-dancing in\nnight clubs.\nConsolata, 33, grew up in Hununa estate\nin Nairobi. Her mother, a single motherof-\nfive, struggled to put her children\nthrough schooL Had well-wishers not\nassisted, Consolata would not have gone\nbeyond primary school because what her\nmother made from her vegetable kiosk\nwas barely enough to feed her and her\nsiblings.\n\"Although 1 was in school, 1 felt frustrated\nbecause I couldn't afford the\nthings my schoolmates had - snacks, cocoa,\nand sugar, minor things that seemed\nvery important to me then:' Consolata\nexplains.\nIn Form Two, Consolata, who was in\nboarding school in Machakos, started\nto smoke cigarettes and bhang \"to cope\nwith the frustration.\"\nIt was easy to get sucked into this behavioUI,\nhaving grown up in an environment\nwhere \"everyone around the corner\"\nwas smoking something. She was soon\nusing cocaine, thanks to the help of her\nschoolmates.\n\"You could get a shot for as little as\nShlo:' she recalls.\nBy then, Consolata, who was only 15\nyears old, was already sexually active.\nThe year she started to do drugs, she got\npregnant. She kept this from her mother\nuntil she could not hide the pregnancy\nariy longer.\n\"She was furious with me, but there\nwas nothing she could do about it,\" she\nrecalls. Soon after she completed Form\nFoUI, she gave birth to her second child.\nSince her mother could not afford to\nsupport her and her sons, she moved in\nwith the father of her children, a matatu\ndriver who lived in the area.\n\"I was beginning to get used to marriage\nwhen he was killed by people believed to\nbe thugs:' she says.\nLeft to raise two children without a job,\nConsolata was willing ~o do anything to\nmake money.\nIt was at this desperate point in her life\nthat a former schoolmate approached her\nand promised to show her how she could\nearn \"easy\" money. Her friend assured\nher that she had the perfect qualifi.cations\nfor the job: Consolata was young,\ntall, slender, and shapely. All she needed\nto add was perfwne, high heels, and underwear,\nand she would be ready to go\nto work.\n\"I was apprehensive about shedding my\nclothes in front of strangers, but I was\nat a point where I was willing to do anything\nto get money to feed my children;'\nshe says.\nThat evening, in 2006, she told her\nmother that she had found a job at a hotel,\nwhere she was required to work the\nnight shift. With her mother's blessings,\nshe reported to her new job at a night\nclub in Thika town.\n\"The girls I found there were between\n18 and 22 years and at 26, 1 felt too old\nto start stripping, but what option did 1\nhave?\"\nShe describes her first night on the job\nas horrifying.\n\"I almost walked away when I\nsaw the experienced girls on\nstage - how could 1 strip and\ndance naked in front of all those cheering,\ndrunken men?\"\nIn spite of her misgivings, she finally\nwent on stage, even though her debut\ninto the world of stripteasing remains a\nblur. That night, she took home Sh8,760\nin tips and an additional Shl,500, which\nthe management paid each girl for every\nevening of work.\n\"1 couldn't believe that 1 could make\nsuch money in just a few hours. I knew\nthat 1 would be back the next day;' Consolata\nsays.\nShe also learnt that the girls snorted\ncocaine before every act to give them the\ncourage to strip. She tried it the following\nday and found that it was easier to do\nthe job when she was \"high\".\n\"The money was good, but the police\nraided the club regularly. We would be arrested\nand bundled into a waiting van!'\nEven though their employer would bail\nthem out, it was humiliating, especially\nbecause the police did not give them\ntime to dress.\nA year into the business, the thought of\nher sons, who were approaching teenage,\nsneaking into the club and seeing her\nnaked started to haunt her. Sbe started\ncontemplating walking away since, ac\u00b7\ncording to her, it would be an unforgiv\u00b7\nable for her children to find out what she\nreally did for a living.\n\"I despised myself and was ashamed of\nwhat I was doing. I constantly wondered\nhow my mother and relatives would react\nif they found o1.1t what 1 did to earn a living,\"\nshe says.\nOne evening, in 2005, she went home\nand looked at all the certificates of the\nshort courses she had done and wondered\nwhy she could not get a proper\njob.\n\"1 cried to God, and asked him to give\nme a respectable alternative means of\nearning a living so that I could continue\nto take care of my children?'\nShe decided to quit her job. With no\nmeans of survival, she moved back into\nhave to live in shame. I know that things\ncan only get better:' she says.\nShe plans to set up an organisation to\nhelp women like her, women stuck in\njobs that they do not want to do, but are\nforced to because they feel they have no\nalternative means of survival.\n\"Many of them, like me, go into it out of\ndesperation - if you can convince them\nthat there's hope for a better life, and\nthere is, then they'd be more willing to\nwalk away:' she says.\nFelicina Wanjiru's story\nShe was only 17 years old when she\ngot into prostitution. When her father\ndied, leaving her older sister to look\nafter her and her six siblings, Felicina\nknew that she would not go beyond\nprimary school. Her mother was a\nhousewife and, therefore, not in a position\nto look after them. Felicina did\nlaundry and fetched water for pay in\nher village in Nyeri for a while, until a\nneighbour told her that she could get a\nbetter-paying job in the city as a house\nhelp.\nIn 2001, she travelled to Huruma in\nNairobi to work for a family that the\nfriend introduced her to.\nShe knew that she was in trouble almost\nimmediately.\n\"My employer worked at night, leaving\nme alone with her nusband and two\nyoung childFen, aged 10 and four years:'\nshe narrates.\nFor the eight months that she worked\nfor the family, she endured constant and\nunwelcome sexual advances and harassment\nfrom her employer'S husband.\n\"I was scared of telling her what was\nhappening, afraid that she would blame\nme for being responsible for her husband's\nbehaviour:' she says.\nOne evening when she could not bear it\nany longer, Felicina packed her clothes\nin a plastic bag and left. She had no\nmoney, nor did she know anyone else\nin Nairoi\nShe settled on spending the night a\nshort distance from street families huddled\nover a fire, confident that come\ndawn, she would find a solution.\nAs fate would have it, a woman passing\nby asked her what she was doing there,\nsaying she did not look like a street\nchild.\n\"1 explained my predicament and to\nmy pleasant surprise, she told me that\n1 could spend the night at her house,\"\nshe says.\nThe following day, Felicina pleaded\nwith the woman to help her find a job\nsince she did not want to go back home.\nShe could hardly believe her luck when\nthe woman informed her that she could\nget her a job where she worked.\n\"I will show you where the money to\nbuy the food we ate yesterday comes\nfrom:' she told her.\nUnknown to her, the woman was a\nprostitute who combed nightclubs for\nclients.\n\"It finally dawned on me what she did\nfor a living when she laid out tiny skirts\non the bed and asked me to choose one,\"\nshe says.\nThe woman showed an uncomfortable\nFelicina how to use make-up and\nlent her a pair of high heels.

Angry, I told her to\nmind her own business, but she wouldn't\nleave me alone:' she recalls.\nThe young woman informed her that\nshe knew about an organisation that\ncould help to start her life afresh. Figuring\nthat the only way to get rid of her\nwas to agree to accompany her to this\norganisation, she finally relented. She\nsays that the counselors here encouraged\nher to start to reevaluate her life.\n\"I often worried about how I would\nsurvive if 1 walked away, but that day, 1\nlmew that I couldn't go back to prostitu\u00b7\ntion.\"\n\"The organisation promised to give\nme food rations and pay my rent until I\ncould stand on my own feet:' she says.\nIntent on starting afresh, Felicina\nchanged her phone number, moved to\na different neighbourhood, and cut links\nwith all her former friends.\nEven though she now relies on odd jobs\nsuch as washing clothes for a fee, and on\ngood days temporarily jobs in factories\nto survive, she says that she is much\nhappier.

What she earns in a month is\nnowhere near what she used to make in a\nnight, but she is happy that she does not\nhave to hide from her children what she\ndoes for a living.\n\"I'm struggling to educate my children\nand to make ends meet, but I no longer\nhave to live in shame.

Once we\ntransform the mothers, we can transform\na generation,\" he says.\nPastor Mbugua says that providing food, and eventually jobs, is an important way of keeping the women from going back to the streets. The main challenge the programme faces is the means to sustain it because he currently depends on personal\nresources. .\n\"They still need to eat and pay rent and school fees for their children,\" he says.\nHe appeals to well-wishers to help by offering\nmoney, jobs, and materials such as sewing machines and hairdressing equip\u00b7\nment, to help empower the affected men\nand women.\nTo find out more about this programme,\nwrite to faithrescuenetwork@gmail.com\nor call 0724573737/0710339907"}
