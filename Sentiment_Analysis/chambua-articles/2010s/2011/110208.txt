{"text": "February 8,\u00a02011\nIf this isn\u2019t hate speech, I don\u2019t know what is \nBy ASUNTA WAGURA\nSufferers. Victims. Patients. These are just some of the words that, in the past, were used to describe and demean people living with HIV (PLWHs).\nWhat is tragic is that at times I still hear some people, out of ignorance, I believe, using these same tags to refer to PLWHs. \nTo cut these people some slack, I used to think of myself as a sufferer and a victim. That was before my friends who were living positively told me that I was doing myself and them a great disservice.\nAnd over the years, several international bodies that deal with HIV-related issues have issued guidelines giving the correct terminologies that should be used in regards to, for instance, PLWHs. \nSo you can imagine my shock when I heard one of our women cabinet Ministers making what, to me, was hate speech.\nIt is women and children who are mostly affected by HIV, and to hear this leader who I have always respected saying that PLHWs should be placed in what amounted to quarantine took me back to the bad old days of institutionalised stigma and discrimination.\nThose were the days when, if one tested HIV positive, they were as good as dead. \nWhat she was saying, in effect, was that PLWHs are sufferers, victims and patients. In that one careless statement, she said that we were pariahs, modern-day lepers, and we do not deserve to mingle with other \u2018normal\u2019 human beings.\nShe was saying that the thousands of her constituents who are HIV positive \u2013 (no wonder there\u2019s rampant stigma and discrimination in her constituency) - and who voted for her are dirty diseased children of a lesser god who are being done a big favour by being let to mingle with her other \u2018super\u2019 constituents. \nIn the \u2018Dark Ages\u2019 of HIV, one of my friends used to say that there was a big difference between HIV and HIV: one is human immunodeficiency virus; the other is human ignoramus virus.\nBy putting her foot in her mouth, this leader put herself in the latter definition of HIV and made me lose the last remaining patience I had in our so-called leaders. \nWith all the information we have on human immunodeficiency virus, I don\u2019t understand why someone \u2013 and in this case someone who has gone to school \u2013 can afford to be ignorant.\nEven the mighty USA, which had for the longest time blocked HIV positive people from entering its country, has seen that it\u2019s an exercise in futility. \nAnd then, after this leader spoke ignorantly, the \u2018what ifs\u2019 followed...\n\u201cWhat if she assumes a higher officer and gets absolute power, will I not find myself in a concentration camp? What if one of her children was living with HIV, would she say the same thing? And does she even know her HIV status? What if she was walking in the shoes that some of us walk in, would she still convict us thus?\u201d\nI would love to tell this leader and all other people who are still living in the Dark Ages what they might know about PLWHs. \nFor starters, a PLWH was also created in the image of God. And this means that we also have inalienable rights. Yes, sometimes these rights are denied, but we fight for them the same way other people fight for theirs. \nMa\u2019am, the second thing is that the only challenge that a PLWH has is a compromised immune system. That\u2019s all. We still have our dignity and self-esteem intact.\nFor us, each day we have to put on defences against opportunistic infections, but that does not mean that, medically or socio-economically, people who are HIV negative are any better than PLWHs. \nPLWHs \u2013 almost all two million of them - are productive members of this country. They are not victims, sufferers or patients. They get up each morning to go and build the nation. They pay taxes. For all I know, some may be legislators who are afraid to go public. And I understand and respect this. \nPLWHs have dreams and high hopes. But they are almost always being held back by, for instance, what you just said and what other unjustified roadblocks that other ignorant people may put on their paths. \nLastly, I\u2019m a mother, and my children love me the way I am. They know that I have not committed a crime. Unless I did not get the latest memo from the August House that being HIV positive is now a crime in our country\u2019s penal code. \nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother of three who tested HIV-positive 24 years ago.
