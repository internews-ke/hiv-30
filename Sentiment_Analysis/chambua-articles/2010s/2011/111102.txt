{"text": "November 2,\u00a02011\nMilly, you deserve a standing ovation\nASUNTA WAGURA\nIt was one day after a national conference for women living with Aids in Kenya. I was still in a jovial mood. In particular,\u00a0I was happy that I had been given an award in recognition of championing women leadership in fighting Aids. \nFinally, someone had recognised what I do. \u201cIt\u2019s not in vain,\u201d I thought happily as I drove home, certain that I would have a good weekend. Then I received an SMS that put a cap on my jovial mood.\n\u201cAsunta, I cried myself to sleep after yesterday\u2019s conference failed to recognise what I\u2019ve gone through with Aids,\u201d said the SMS. \nIt reminded me that not everyone was awarded, that some people went home downcast after their efforts in this important fight went unrecognised. \nMilly* is a 42-year-old widow. Her story goes back to the 1990s, when I first met her. She was this beautiful woman married to a pilot and together they had a daughter. \nIt did not take long for us to strike up a friendship since she always attended to me whenever I went to see her boss. \nOne day, she offered to buy me a drink and from then, we became firm friends. Our bond was almost like that of sisters since we shared so much. \nShe met her husband in Australia, where she had been working. It was love at first sight. \n\u201cHe was handsome, healthy, and fit, so nothing like STI or HIV crossed my mind,\u201d Milly told me. \nWithout thinking twice, she agreed to marry him. They intended to travel to Kenya to solemnise their marriage. But that did not happen. \nIn the course of living together in Australia, their daughter, Frida, was conceived. She was premature and had to be placed in an incubator. \n\u201cLater, a nurse informed me that I needed to go back home since my insurance cover did not cover the sickness she had.\u201d \nNo alarm bells went off in Milly\u2019s mind. However, on arrival in Kenya, she was surprised again that insurance companies were unwilling to cover her and her baby because of the \u201ccondition\u201d they had. \n\u201cNo one told me what the condition was,\u00a0but one doctor showed me my baby\u2019s card. It read sero-positive. It meant nothing to me. I had no idea that sero-positive meant HIV-positive. It was only after I visited a private hospital that I was told Frida was HIV-positive.\u201d\nHeartbroken, Milly confronted her husband, and he confirmed her worst fears; he had all along known that he was HIV-positive. \nIn fact, he had known it for five years. He had even lost his first wife to Aids-related complications, although he had lied to Milly that doctors had been unable to pin-point what she was ailing from. Milly, blinded with love, did not pursue the matter.\n\u201cIt was too late for me to withdraw from the relationship. One, I was sick. And two, my baby and husband were also getting sick, on and off, and needed my care.\u201d\nFour years later, Milly lost Frida to Aids-related complications. This was after the couple had spent all their savings and even borrowed from friends.\u2028Drowning their sorrows\n\u201cAfter Frida was buried, our family fell apart. It was as if she was the super glue that held us together. We both turned to heavy drinking. My husband\u2019s health deteriorated. Exactly 11 months after the burial of our daughter, he passed away.\u201d \nMilly told me she did not cry during her husband\u2019s funeral because she had cried herself dry during his illness. The writing was on the wall. It was apparent that he, too, was going to die and she would be left alone.\nI remember going to the mortuary on the day of her husband\u2019s burial. I avoided her. \nHow could I convince her there was still hope after all she had gone through? I did not have any words of comfort. \nMilly is one woman who, although the conference did not recognise her, has gone through a lot of suffering. \nShe tells me that at times, when grief gets the better of her, she takes the photo albums and hugs and kisses the photos as she fondly remembers her family that once was. \nShe now spends her time educating HIV-positive people about the disease, and how to live with it. \nToday, please join me\u00a0in recognising Milly, a woman of strength. The fact that she still has the power, energy\u00a0and breathe to help others, after all she has gone through means that she deserves a standing ovation. \nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother-of-three who tested HIV-positive 24 years ago. She is the executive director of the Kenya Network of Women with Aids (KENWA). asuntawagura@hotmail.com"}
