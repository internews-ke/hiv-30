{"text": "YOU CANNOT ATTACH A PRICE TAG TO YOUR LIFE\nYes we need cheaper\nantiretroviral drugs\n\nTHE RECENT ANNOUNCEMENT that\nthe cost of antiretroviral drugs is about\nto come down is good news. This is just\npart of a long line of good news that\npeople living with HIV have had in our\ncountry for some time now. I remember\ntelling you how, years ago, the. price of\nARVs was so exorbitant that some of\nthose living with HIV would mortgage\ntheir property to have these life-prolonging\ndrugs.\nMost people took drugs only when\nthey could afford them. This meant\nthat they would begin a regimen, only\nto stop it once they ran out of money.\nThis would make the virus to develop\nresistance to that regimen. When they,\nif they were fortunate, got the money\nto continue treatment, they would be\ninformed that they had to use another\nline of treatment because the virus had\ndeveloped resistance to the first line.\nThis switching wouid go on until it\ngot to a point where their bodies could\nnot take it anymore and they would\nsuccumb to HIV-related complications.\nIn fact, a study done several years ago\nfound that in Kenya, HIV had dropped\nlife expectancy from 62 to 46 years. I\n.am sure that with the recent gains that\nHIV activists have made in the fight for\nuniversal access of ARVs to all, the numbers\nneed to be reviewed.\nHere, there are so many people on\nantiretrovirai therapy, ( I can say without\nfear of contradiction that most of the\nclients are women) that a couple of\nyears ago, some men were complaining\nthat this was doing great injustice to\nthem because they would not be able\nto tell who was HIV-positive and who\nwas negative.\nIn out country, as in many other countries,\nmedical care is one of the biggest\nchallenges that the government has to\ndeal with. When we got our independence,\none of the enemies that the founding\nfathers said needed urgent attention\nwas disease. We may be almost half-a century\nold now, but disease continues\nto wreak havoc on our families. Just last\nmonth, we were commemorating the\ncancer month and, from what I hear, the\ncases continue to rise.\nWhat cheaper ARVs mean to PLWHs\nis that most of us will be able to breathe\neasier. It puts the steering wheel back\ninto the hands of those with the virus,\nespecially those who live in informal settlements\nand have to make do with the\nbare minimum.\n\"What will I buy - food for my children\nor drugs for myself?\" I remember\nJanice\u00b7, one of our members, asking me\nback in the day when the government\nsubsidised the cost of ARVs.\nThen, the government had promised\nto purchase and deliver a one-year\nsupply of drugs to 5,000 HIV positive\npeople. Janice was one of the clients in\nthe programme. The only problem was\nthat she was required to pay sh1,OOO,\nmoney she could not afford to part\nPHOTO! FILE\nwith. To her, this amount of money was\nthe two-weeks profit she made from the\nincome-generating activity that we had\nhelped her to set up. Now, understandably,\nshe was torn between feeding her\nfour children - her husband had left her\nwhen she tested HIV-positive - or buying\ndrugs to prolong her life.\nIt was a catch-22 situation that we, together\nwith her counsellor, helped her to\nresolve. We made her understand that\nshe cannot attach a price tag to her life\nor the wellbeing of her children. We also\ngave her the grim statistics and some\nstraight talk: that it was estimated that,\nby 2010, an estimated 106 million children\nunder 15 years of age will have lost\none or both parents, with 25 million of\nthis group orphaned due to HIV/Aids.\n\"Ultimately, it's up to you,\" we told\nJanice, but we could see that sense\nwas sinking in, and she was thinking\nabout herself now, putting herself first.\nbecause that was the only way her children would not be statistics.\nPeople living with HIV are faced with\nmyriad life or death choices. Fortunately\nthough, the choice on whether to go or\nnot go on treatment because of financial\nconstraints is becoming less of a\nconcern to HIV service providers.\nI called Janice a few days ago when\nI heard that the cost of ARVs was coming\ndown and reminded her of the wise\ndecision she made six years ago. Two of\nher children are in high school, her business\nhas picked up, and she is helping\nother women living with HIV to make\nthe right choices.\nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura,\na mother-of-three who tested HIV\u00b7\npositive 24 years ago, She is the\nexecutive director of. the Kenya Network\nof Women with Aids (KENWA),\nasuntawagura@hotmail.eom"}
