{"text": "December 10,\u00a02011\nObama administration should first preach \u2018gay rights\u2019 to Republicans\nBy GITAU WARIGI\nAmerican administrations have an annoying habit of pushing their domestic policies into their relations with other countries, even on matters of no clear benefit to those countries.\nI have no desire to engage in debate on whether homosexual lifestyles are good or bad. Period. \nWhat makes me wonder is what premium the US thinks it is gaining when Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stands up in Geneva \u2014 as she recently did \u2014 to warn Africa that America could start applying sanctions to countries that do not respect gay rights.\nThere are policy interventions the West makes in Africa which are enormously meaningful to Africans. \nTake for example America\u2019s extensive anti-HIV programmes or the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act. \nEven when the interventions are of the kind that provoke knee-jerk cries of \u201cwe are sovereign!\u201d from African rulers \u2014 remember the US push for political pluralism? \u2014 they are of a weight such that nobody can afford not to take them seriously.\nI am not sure homosexual rights occupy this position. Nigeria\u2019s reaction when British Prime Minister David Cameron preceded Mrs Clinton in linking aid to Africa to respect for gay rights was to rush a Senate Bill within days criminalising gay lifestyles. \nClearly the message from Abuja to the West on this one was: \u201cStuff it.\u201d Several other African countries are already lining up to tighten their laws against homosexuals, Mrs Clinton\u2019s \u201cthreat\u201d notwithstanding.\nThis continent has huge priorities other than dwelling on tittle-tattle about same sex relations. \nWhen the likes of China have partnered with Africa on a veritable infrastructure-development revolution all across the continent on a scale that has not been seen before, the West\u2019s response to base aid on sexual orientation comes across as silly and ridiculous.\nI couldn\u2019t care less if a Gay Pride Day was affixed to our laws or whether my neighbour becomes gay and joins the parade. \nBut I worry when serious countries turn themselves into objects of derision by investing their capital in campaigns that will yield them precious little in return.\nIf Africa will turn gay, so be it. But in the meantime, the West is intentionally misreading the mood of the continent and not just that within the various State Houses. \nIn fact, on this one, it is the African politicians who are in sync with the majority of their subjects.\nLocal human rights lobbies have been studiously silent over this homosexual frenzy. \nBut once it dawns on them that Western money could soon start pouring into this pro-gay business, expect them to dive greedily into the trough. \nWhen that day comes, the epithet homophobic will carry the same sting as today\u2019s \u201canti-reformist\u201d does.\nKenyans had something of a debate on homosexuality during the constitution referendum campaigns and when the CJ was being vetted. \nThe whole tenor of the discussion did not come across as a comfortable one. That is Kenya for you.\nI mentioned at the outset that this gay fetish of the Obama administration is tied to domestic US politics. \nThe Republicans have gone so far to the extreme in demonising gay marriage and abortion that the administration finds it useful to flaunt some \u201cliberal\u201d credentials, even if this is done in Geneva ostensibly for the benefit of Africans.\nIf President Obama and Mrs Clinton are serious, let them start their pro-gay crusade in America itself. \nIn only two or so states of the 50 in the USA is same sex marriage legal. And not a single one of the array of Republican opponents who threaten to floor Mr Obama in next year\u2019s presidential election is fond of homosexuals. \nBefore the Obama administration brings its pro-gay message to targets it deems weak like Africa, why not start with the rabidly anti-gay evangelical wing of the Republican party?\nWe can guarantee Mr Obama and Mrs Clinton one thing. They should expect to start getting floods of asylum applications from purportedly gay Africans who are perfectly not.\ngwarigi@ke.nationmedia.com\nadvertisement \nAdvertisement \nMost Popular\n\uf0b7  1 News FULL SPEECH: State of the Nation address \n\uf0b7  2 Politics Bensouda seeks private hearing \n\uf0b7  3 Showbiz Eric Omondi pulls prank on fans with Lupita look-alike \n\uf0b7  4 Politics Women leaders threaten to strip over MP\u2019s remark \n\uf0b7  5 News Baby smashed to death on floor \n\uf0b7  6 News Security heightened over car bomb threat \n\uf0b7  7 Video Mzee Kipaika hosts Uhuru, Ruto for lunch in Kajiado \n\uf0b7  8 World Obama agents sent home from Europe for boozing \n\uf0b7  9 Kilifi Baby mauled to death by dogs in Kilifi \nAdvertisement \nMost Commented\n\uf0b7  1Homosexuality a serious problem as terrorism, says Duale \n\uf0b7  2Uhuru Kenyatta seeks US help to fight terrorism \n\uf0b7  3US centre defends Raila invitation as 'badge of honour' \n\uf0b7  4Thugs turn luxury homes into tombs - Business - nation.co.ke \n\uf0b7  5Gunmen kill two in attack on Kenyan church: police \n\uf0b7  6Seven days to public transport crisis \n\uf0b7  7Kenyans in the US to be issued with IDs: Embassy \n\uf0b7  8Daily Nation: Living - Breaking News, Kenya, Africa, Politics, Business, Sports, Blogs, Photos, Videos \n\uf0b7  9New law allowing polygamy passed - Politics - nation.co.ke \n\uf0b7  10Mother of son with bullet in head died shielding him \n\nPhoto gallery\nSearch for missing Malaysian plane\nAdvertisement "}
