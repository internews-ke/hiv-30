{"text": "Girl\u2019s agony as tutor reveals HIV status\nBy ERICK NGOBILO engobilo@ke.nationmedia.com\nA primary school teacher risks losing his job over claims that he disclosed the HIV status of a pupil.\nThe disclosure is said to have subsequently led to discrimination, forcing the pupil to drop out of the Bungoma County school.\nArea education director Daniel Mosibei said the teacher risked losing his job if found guilty of the accusations against him. \n\u201cWe have launched investigations and we are treating the case seriously. Serious action, including dismissal, will be taken if the case is proved,\u201d he said.\nMr Mosibei said disclosing a pupil\u2019s HIV status and segregating them was a breach of the child\u2019s rights.\nThe pupil said her class teacher exposed her HIV status to other children, teachers and parents, leading to discrimination and stigma that eventually saw her drop out of school.\nThe incident undermines the fight against HIV/Aids, with reports saying that victims of the disease are still discriminated against, especially in rural areas.\nThe pupil said she cut short her learning after her school colleagues shunned her because of her HIV status.\n\u201cNo one wanted to be near me. They rejected all the items I touched and they were not willing to shake my hand,\u201d she said amid sobs. \nShe said trouble started when her class teacher learnt about her status and told her classmates to be careful when interacting with her lest they contract the disease.\nSit alone in corner \nThe girl said she was forced to sit alone at a corner in the classroom, with the teacher refusing to mark her assignments.\n\u201cMy stay in school was hell. The experience still torments me to date,\u201d she said.\nShe said the situation got worse when the teacher disclosed her status at the school assembly.\nThe revelation of her status forced her to seek transfer to a neighbouring school but news of her condition had spread. \n\u201cThe school is just within the neighbourhood, so the pupils and teachers already knew of my status when I moved there,\u201d she said.\nThe girl said villagers and other pupils laughed at her, with some parents demanding she be withdrawn from the school because she could infect their children. \n\u201cThey threatened to withdraw their children if I was not expelled. I opted to leave on my own,\u201d she said.\nThe girl\u2019s mother said her daughter has been on anti-retro- viral drugs since she was born HIV-positive. \n\u201cMy daughter was very traumatised. She locked herself in the house for many days and up to now she is still reluctant to face the world,\u201d she said.\nMwatikho Torture Survivors Organisation executive director Taiga Wanyanja has called for thorough investigations into the case."}
