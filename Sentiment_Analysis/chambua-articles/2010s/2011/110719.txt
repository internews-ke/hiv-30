{"text": "July 19,\u00a02011\nI lied to save this man\u2019s life \nBy ASUNTA WAGURA\nI had gone to Nyahururu to bury one of our staff members, and as the funeral service was going on, I received an SMS telling me that my son, Israel, who was unwell, wasn\u2019t showing any improvement. \nI had left him with a fever, and was torn between staying with him, and attending this burial. \nIf I failed to attend the burial however, someone was bound to say that I was only interested in the deceased when she was alive. Eventually, I had left Israel in the care of my house help. \nThe SMS alarmed me, and I immediately headed home, driving at breakneck speed. Near Gilgil, I was stopped by the police, for over-speeding. \nThey took my car keys, and my driving license, and led me to their waiting car, which no doubt would transport me to the nearest police station, where I would spend the weekend. \nAs I huddled inside, together with other offenders, I decided to tell the police officer who had arrested me why I had broken the rules.\nI\u2019m one of those people who tell the truth if the situation demands it, no matter how ugly it is. \nHowever, this does not mean that I cannot tell a lie or two here and there, to get out of a nasty situation. \nI called the officer and showed him the SMS I had received. \nWithout a second thought, he handed me my car cars, but cautioned me not to speed again, since I could end up killing myself before I reached my child. \nI had just fitted my safety belt, and was about to start the car when I saw a man trying to get my attention through the window. \nHe was smartly dressed, in a black suit and tie. \u201cWho is he?\u201d I wondered. \u201cOh, no, not another policeman!\u201d I thought to myself.\nHe was quick to introduce himself when I rolled down the window. \u201cI\u2019m sure you don\u2019t remember me. I\u2019m Baba Shelmith, the one you helped in Umoja Estate.\u201d \nHis name rang a bell, and immediately, his story came back to me. He is a man I once helped through a big lie. \nWhen he came knocking on my door one evening many years ago, he was miserable and very sick.\nHe told me all he wanted was bus fare to his upcountry home, because his sister had kicked him out of his house, after discovering that he was HIV-positive. \nHe told me he had come to Nairobi hoping to get the antiretrovirals, but was put on the 5000-plus beeline instead. \nHis story touched me. It touched me because in his desperation, he told me that he wanted to go upcountry and die there.\nI imagined his children visiting him, and wondering when he would die, because he looked so frail and sickly. I just had to do something. \nI offered him my sofa to sleep on, in my then two-room house, and the following morning, I took him to KENWA where, among other things, his CD4 count was assessed.\nI had already made a decision to share my ARVs with him, although this is was akin to a crime.\nBaba Shel continued to sleep on my seat, and share my ARVs. During the one month that he lived with me, his health improved tremendously. \nI had told him to lie that he had never taken ARVs when it was his turn to be put on a treatment plan. \nTelling the truth would have put me in big trouble. Through this lying, this man\u2019s life was saved, and he lived to see the day when he was officially put on the treatment plan. \nHad I not schemed, I doubt that this man would have survived \u2013 he had been too sick.\nOverjoyed, I got out of the car and hugged him, and we even reminisced about how we had lied our way through a medical bureaucracy that would have turned him into yet another HIV fatality. \nAs I got back into the car, and resumed my journey home, I felt surprisingly calm, and was no longer worried about my son, who, even though I cannot explain why, I was convinced was out of danger. I was right.\nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother of three who tested HIV-positive 24 years ago.
