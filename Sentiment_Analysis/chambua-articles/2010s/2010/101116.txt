{"text": "November 16,\u00a02010\nThe Will I wrote in a moment of panic \nBy ASUNTA WAGURA\nThey say that sleep is the cousin of death, and nowhere does this aptly apply than when one is put to sleep under anaesthesia before surgery. \nAnd it\u2019s at such times, just before your heavy eyelids shut, that your life flashes before you. At least that\u2019s what happened to me when I gave birth to my son Issa, through caesarean section. \nI felt like withdrawing, like turning back the hands of time, and going back to a time when I hadn\u2019t gone this far with my baby project, but I\u2019d been overtaken by events. I asked myself millions of questions. \nSuppose I don\u2019t wake up from that induced sleep? Was I selfish to want this baby this bad? Is this my comeuppance? And, to compound my fears, all of a sudden, I heard people talking about people who died on the operating table. This wasn\u2019t part of the deal. \nI did a quick Will at the spur of the moment. I didn\u2019t want to die intestate. I also put in all my PIN information, existing bank accounts, life insurance policies and how they would be executed, just in case. \nIf those who say I am strong would\u2019ve seen me, they would\u2019ve changed their minds. My eyes were watery and red as I wondered whether this was the right decision, considering all the parties that would be affected if I passed on. \nIn my Will, I left a message for my unborn baby, telling him that I loved him. I wished him all the best in life in this world, agonising about my absence from the life of this baby that I\u2019d fought tooth and nail for. \nI didn\u2019t forget to emphasise that this baby had cost me too much and therefore should never ever be surrendered to a children\u2019s home: \u201cRichard and Peter should ensure he\u2019s brought up well and gets a good education.\u201d \nNext, I signed an open check and I gave it to my foster daughter Kadogo. I instructed her that the money should be drawn to facilitate my funeral, and that people should not spend a lot of\u00a0their time\u00a0mourning me. \u201cI should be buried in the shortest time possible so people can go on with their lives.\u201d \nI don\u2019t know what had come over me to make me almost give up after I had done the grueling marathon and I was now on the homestretch. \nAll along, I had been the stronger person, constantly pushing Richard, and I guess, unbeknownst to me, all this had sapped all my emotions and courage. \nMuch later, I was reminded of the eternal words of a Tanzanian athlete who finished his marathon race in the Olympics hours after everyone else: \u201cMy country didn\u2019t send me here to start; they sent me here to finish.\u201d\nSilly of me to start, and start strong, what I couldn\u2019t finish! I was eternally grateful when I woke up after the surgery. I refer to that ordeal as my resurrection miracle, because on that table you\u2019re not even half dead. \nYou\u2019re worse. You simply don\u2019t exist and only these white-coated professionals\u00a0and machines exist to ensure you wake up again in this world. \nAnd to that team that killed me and resurrected me, with another life to boot, I say a big thank you. I owe you guys a treat. Even with thoughts of mortality speeding through my mind at neck-break speed, I hadn\u2019t let things to chance. \nThere is another team that I charged with waiting for the baby just next to the theatre door to ensure I got my actual baby. A mother can\u2019t be too careful, especially after what I\u2019d been through with my pregnancy. \n\u201cWe have heard one hundred and one baby stories and I don\u2019t want to be part of the statistics,\u201d I told Richard. \nRichard and his team waited until I woke up and saw the baby, identified birth marks, including his crying tone, which would ensure that nobody would exchange him. I then bid them goodbye until we met the next day. To this critical group I say thank you. \nI don\u2019t mean to brag, but this is to my HIV virus: it\u2019s now clear who is on the winning side, sucker. That\u2019s why I put it to you that you have no choice but to behave.\nThese children must complete school, get degrees, and marry so I can see my grandchildren. Hopefully, at that time, we can reshuffle the cards for a new game. I\u2019m in the lead, sucker, and you\u2019ve got some catching up to do. \nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother of three who tested HIV-positive 23 years ago. She is the executive director of the Kenya Network of Women with Aids (KENWA)."}
