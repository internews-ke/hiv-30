{"text": "unday, September 12,\u00a02010\nHe gave me a gift of HIV for my 28-year loyalty \n0 \nPrint \n\n\u00a0 \nadvertisement \nBy PHILIP KITOTO\nHello,\u2028I\u2019m a 50-year-old employed woman in\u00a0a 28-year marriage. I have five grown up children, the last born of whom turned 20 this year.\nIn the 28 years that we have been together, my husband has never been responsible for his family.\u00a0He has always taken his responsibilities halfheartedly; in that, if we needed, say, Sh30,000 for school fees, he would give Sh5,000 and forget about it.\nHe doesn\u2019t pay rent, which is Sh10,000 monthly, but chips in small amounts from his business (which he claims earns him only Sh500 a day) to supplement our food budget.\nWhen our first born joined Form One some years back, he was retired and spent all his golden handshake on his own, giving us only Sh10,000. We have survived on my loans from the two Saccos in which I am a member, the proceeds from which I also use to educate the children, three of whom are in university now.\nI am born again, and have trusted in God to save the situation. I have never strayed from the marriage despite the hardship, and always engage my spare time in serving God. \nTwo months ago, I developed this persistent cough that would not respond to medication.\u00a0On the doctor\u2019s advice, I decided to take an HIV test and it turned out positive.\u00a0I was devastated and wanted to inform my husband right away, but a friend advised me to try and get us (me and my husband) tested together first before discussing the issue.\u00a0He has refused to do so.\nThe torment of living with him, trying to be nice to him, seeing him everyday and not being able to discuss this is killing me.\u00a0For the last 60 days, I have tried to talk to him, but he has remained adamant that he will never go for an HIV test, and that he is ready to die.\nLast night, I caught him taking medicine at midnight. I pretended to be asleep when I saw him pull out some doses from his pocket.\u00a0I pray every day to God to give me the strength to last me another day.\nMy dilemma is; what next.\u00a0Should I leave him, move away with my children?\nACC\nHello,\nLet me start by commending you for the hard work you have put in your marriage, and particularly for the sake your children. Three are in university. Wow! You have to take pride in this.\nTwenty eight years in a relationship is a great investment, and this should also be cause for a great celebration. Let it be your source of encouragement. You have done your best to be the woman God wants you to be.\nHowever, several things have happened: One, you have sacrificed a lot \u2014 and this could have hardened you over the years such that you cannot respond to certain emotions. Literally, your husband\u2019s presence is of no value to you since his share of responsibilities has always been carried by you. \nSecond, you have, in many facets, assumed the role of the leader at home, especially when we consider the demands and needs of the home that you have to bear.\nAs a Christian, try to model after Christ. The new knowledge you have about the infection is definitely worrying. I guess it is going to be quite hard to convince him to see a doctor. The best option?\n1 Take immediate steps to get personal help from the doctor. Get on medication because I don\u2019t think this is the time to give up or be filled with anxiety, anger and bitterness towards him, for this will only complicate your life and shift your focus from the family. \n2 You may need to join a counselling or support team that can help you live positively. \n3 Ask him for a time off to have some talk, just the two of you. Say this firmly and confidently. You know how he views you when you mean business. If he is normally aggressive, it may not be wise to face him alone.\nDuring your time together, break the news of having been at the doctor\u2019s. This step must be handled with care, and the counsellors you saw when you were being tested can help in this regard. Whichever way, you must tell him about this. Talk to him when you are sober and focused.\nLeaving and walking away is not the answer. He needs help and you could as well be the person who God may use to break through this hard wall surrounding him. Your prayers, tears, and pain have been heard by the God of heaven, and I believe he will provide the way. \n4 I believe your children will learn something positive about life from how you handle yourself and your husband. Their future steps in life will be guided by what they see now. They know you have sacrificed, paid heavily for them to be in college today. Give them hope as you commit yourself to hoping in the unfailing God. The outcome of your discussions will determine your next cause of action.\nAll the best.\n********\nHelp! I am torn between a rock and a broke fellow\nHello,\nI am 25 years old and I have been in a relationship with a man who had separated with his wife for three years. He says the separation was occasion by the wife\u2019s disinterest in sex after the birth of their son, and that they had decided to stay off each other as they sought a formal divorce. The two love their son very much, he also says.\nAt the beginning of this year, I fell pregnant with him. As fate would have it, his wife changed her mind over the separation, and the man chose the wife over me, which really left me devastated as I do not have a job.\nWhat hurts me most is that, even after trusting this man enough to conceive his child, and after all the bad things he told me about his wife when they were not in good terms, he still went back to her. The excuse he gave was that they were reuniting because of the son, as if my baby was not reason enough for him to stay with me!\nNow, the wife has decided, again, that he does not want anything to do with him. For the brief term that they were together, he says they were never intimate, and that he was a fool to go back to a \u2018terrorist\u2019 instead of staying with me.\nNow that they have gone separate ways, he has filed for custody of the child, even though divorce is not on the cards yet.\nAfter they reunited with his wife, he still kept on supporting me, even though I started dating another man who was just as jobless as me and hence could not pay my rent. That is how this other man chipped in with the finances, even though he knew I was in another relationship.\nThe jobless fellow has since moved into my house, and I have housed him for almost five months now. He was my first love some six years ago, but we grew apart and lost contact.\nThis is my dilemma: I feel nothing for any of these two men in my life. One of them has the money to support me, says he loves me and all that, but I am still angry at him for deserting me at my greatest hour of need.\nThe other guy is so lazy and irresponsible that I feel I will have to support the family if we are to get together... but I don\u2019t have the money. He knows very well that someone else is paying the rent and clothing me, but he says that should be no reason for me to get cosy with the other guy because of what he took me through. I am growing out of love with him by the hour.\nHe is a university graduate, 28 years old and optimistic that he will chance upon a job one of these fine days, and that things will take a turn for the better for us. But why doesn\u2019t he act like a man and move me to his house instead of staying under my roof?\nPhilip, should I go back to the other man, stay with this jobless fellow or boot the two of them altogether?\nPlease help."}
