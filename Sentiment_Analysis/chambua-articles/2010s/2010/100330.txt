{"text": "March 30,\u00a02010\nAirtime targeted for Aids tax \ncomment \nBy DAVID NJAGI \nEvery time you make a call on your cell phone or catch a flight to a destination outside Kenya, you will be contributing towards financing HIV treatment if a new proposal by the National Aids Control Council (NACC) is endorsed by Cabinet.\nNACC\u2019s steering committee is pushing for \u201cspecial levies\u201d on airline traffic and mobile phone airtime to raise funds to finance the country\u2019s Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) programme.\nBut NACC head of strategy Regina Ombam said, however, this will wait until the next financial year to see if Treasury factors them into the budget.\nMs Ombam said the government is hoping to raise more than Sh24 billion from the two special levies over five years to offset the financial drain on the programme after the Global Fund for Aids TB and Malaria rejected Kenya\u2019s application for round nine funding over corruption allegations.\nIf approved, the new proposals that will be tabled to the government in June through a Cabinet paper, will charge a levy of Sh1.90 for every passenger booked on an outbound flight, while goods being ferried aboard airliners are expected to contribute about Sh3.50 per tonne. \nWhile this is the case, Ms Ombam says NACC has approached mobile phone firm Safaricom to enforce a levy of 2 per cent for every cell phone voice minute sold.\n\u201cWe expect to pool some Sh12 billion from the airline traffic levy while the sale of cell phone voice minutes will help us raise about Sh11 billion over a five year period,\u201d she says.\nSafaricom chief executive officer Michael Joseph said the company would be willing to support such an initiative. Kenya Airways marketing department declined to comment.\nAccountability\nBut Mr Joseph said the government should be more accountable and transparent on how it uses tax payers\u2019 money.\n\u201cWe will be willing to consider such an initiative,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the government should reduce the cost of doing business in Kenya and be more responsible in the way it uses money raised from its citizens.\u201d \nThe move by NACC comes amid fears that the country could face financial shortfall for the government\u2019s ART programme after Global Fund in February denied Kenya Sh21 billion ($270 million) for Aids and malaria programmes.\nWhile over 75 per cent of HIV/Aids funding is sourced from donors, the 2009/13 Kenya National Aids Strategic Plan (KNASP) says the government is facing a financing gap of more than Sh22 billion ($300 million) for ART programmes.\nLast year KNASP had projected Kenya\u2019s spending to accumulate to about Sh5.3 billion in the 2012/13 financial year alone, due to proposed annual segmented scale-up intervention.\nadvertisement "}
