{"text": "October 8,\u00a02010\nAlarm as HIV-positive youth in Uganda quit treatment for religion\nBy IRIN\nKampala, Friday\nUgandan health workers are concerned by the growing number of HIV-positive teenagers who are abandoning their treatment after turning to bogus religious leaders.\n\u201cOver the years, we have noticed a growing trend of adolescents and caregivers who have withdrawn from treatment with a belief of having been cured of HIV/Aids in church,\u201d said Cissy Ssuna, the counselling coordinator at Baylor College of Medicine Children\u2019s Foundation Uganda, which treats more than 4,000 HIV-infected children, 750 of who are adolescents.\nRebecca Nakityo, 17, spends every free moment watching gospel TV, reading the Bible or praying in church. The soft-spoken teen \u2014 who has lived with her aunt and uncle since her parents\u2019 death several years ago \u2014 told IRIN/PlusNews she believed she was cured by God six months ago.\nAccording to Nakityo, as the pastor\u2019s voice reverberated through the church hall, she felt filled with the healing power of God. Nakityo now regularly gives testimonies about her \u201chealing\u201d and has stopped taking her anti-retroviral drugs (ARVs).\nBy the time many young people find their way back to the health system, it is too late. \u201cWe had a client who was in church; they brought her and dumped her at Baylor \u2014 we tried to treat her, but it was already too late,\u201d Ssuna said.\nShe noted that the practice was more common among Pentecostal churches than other religious denominations and that while teens often made the decision to abandon treatment on their own, peer pressure was also a factor.\nA 2007 study by Uganda\u2019s Makerere University\u2019s Infectious Disease Institute found that 1.2 per cent of 558 respondents initiating ARVs discontinued therapy because they believed they had been spiritually healed. Four out of six restarted therapy, but three required much more expensive second-line salvage therapy.\nOne spiritual leader told IRIN/PlusNews that patients were misled by unscrupulous pastors. He advises HIV-positive believers to pray for healing, but continue with their medication. \n\u201cThe missionaries knew that very well \u2014 that is why they built churches alongside hospitals,\u201d said Bishop Dunstan Bukenya from the central district of Mityana.\nAccording to Mary Kiwanuka, who has an adolescent daughter living with HIV, the influence of television evangelists should not be underestimated. \nShows people being healed\n\u201cThese children are exposed to too much television which shows people being healed,\u201d she said. \u201cIn their circumstances, with too much peer pressure and the pill load, if there is an alternative they take it.\u201d\nSsuna said rather than criticising the church, her organisation was trying to work with spiritual leaders to encourage teens to stay on treatment rather than abandon it for religious reasons.\nBetween March and October 2009, Baylor enlisted trained spiritual leaders to counsel the adolescents and caregivers after they noticed that many people \u2014 especially adolescents \u2014 had quit treatment. \nClients said the visits were uplifting and alleviated distress. Baylor and other HIV service providers now want spiritual counselling to be a standard part of the HIV package offered to patients. \u201cSpiritual care has a role to play in HIV/Aids care and treatment programmes,\u201d she added.
