{"text": "March 9,\u00a02010\nThe incredible strength of an unsung heroine\nBy ASUNTA WAGURA\nI recently received an invitation to participate in the International Women\u2019s Day (IWD). I didn\u2019t confirm my participation. \nMy role was clear: to outline the achievements we have made in the recent past towards the empowerment of women, \u201cas someone who has made tremendous achievements in this area\u201d, to quote the invitation card. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the poster-child for women\u2019s empowerment. \nAnn Njeri, 45, from Nyahururu may be unsung, but she\u2019s a real heroine. She fits the bill. \nA good Samaritan referred her to us and immediately changed her phone number, fearing that we might call her for more information or assistance.\nLater, Njeri and her 11-year-old daughter, Eunice, were admitted to our rescue centre. Njeri, who had tested HIV positive two years earlier, was suffering from cancer of the colon.\nLooking at the pair, it was hard to tell who had brought the other. But the striking thing was that, although we put Njeri under medical care, she had actually brought her daughter and was not seeking treatment for herself. \nThat\u2019s the highest form of sacrifice. I believe this woman should tell the world about the incredible strength of a woman.\nEunice is one of the most pathetic cases I\u2019ve ever dealt with. I visited them twice during their first week at the rescue centre, and both times I locked myself in the bathroom and cried. \nAnd I mean cry my eyes out. In my daily work, I rarely cry, no matter how difficult the situation might be, but this case made me shed a bucketful of tears. \nAnd I cried, not because Njeri was going to lose her daughter or that she herself didn\u2019t have long to live, but because she was a challenge to me.\nDespite all that this mother and daughter had gone through, she was not about to give up.\nShe always had a smile. Plus, she did not blame anybody for her situation.\n\u201cDid you have any neighbours where you were living?\u201d I once asked her.\n\u201cThey got tired of us. We\u2019ve been in this condition for more than a year and I understand their reluctance to help.\u201d\nEunice was attacked by severe meningitis, which made her blind, deaf and her emaciated HIV-infected body was almost doubled over. It\u2019s the meningitis that had made her mother have her tested on the doctor\u2019s advice.\n\u201cOn testing HIV-positive, I informed my husband,\u201d she narrated. \u201cHe didn\u2019t comment, but the following morning he packed a few belongings and left for good.\u201d\nWhat was touching about this woman was that she was not about to give up on her dying daughter. Even as our community health workers assisted her daughter, she always insisted on being there, lending a helping hand, despite her poor health. \nHer strength, determination and fighting spirit were indefatigable.\nIn December last year, we packed mother and daughter in one of our vehicles and took them home after we ran out of funds to sustain them at our rescue centre. I say packed because these two patients couldn\u2019t sit.\nWe \u201carranged\u201d them in the best possible way, which looked like packing them. Returning them home was almost akin to conceding what their Nyahururu neighbours had done \u2014 defeat.\nHowever, Njeri appreciated the little we had done to make their lives comfortable during their four-month admission at our rescue centre. I\u2019ve never seen such fortitude.\nThis IWD, I know neither Njeri nor her daughter had the time to look at the day\u2019s theme, of \u201cEqual rights, equal opportunities: Progress for all\u201d. \nI don\u2019t think Njeri had time to go through a newspaper, or to take stock of progress made in women\u2019s empowerment if none of this could reduce the physical, psychological and emotional pain she\u2019s going through. \nI don\u2019t think she has any faith in our \u201cpolitical progress\u201d. She has been turned from one hospital to the other because she cannot pay the bills. She\u2019s either too poor to be treated in the said facilities, or they don\u2019t have the medication she requires.\nI don\u2019t know what to promise Njeri next time I visit her. That a new constitution is in the offing? Duh! I believe what Njeri is trying to tell our leaders can be found in the immortal words of writer Albert Camus: \u201cDon\u2019t walk in front of me, I may not follow. Don\u2019t walk behind me, I may not lead. Just walk beside me and be my friend.\u201d\nIf there were any award this IWD, it should have gone to Ann Njeri.\nasuntawagura@hotmail.com\nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother of two who tested positive 20 years ago.
