{"text": "February 28,\u00a02010\nFear of knowing HIV status hurts blood donation \nBy SAMMY CHEBOI\nKenya is unable to meet its annual blood requirements due to fears among potential donors that their HIV status would be known.\nThe trend has made it difficult and expensive for the National Blood Transfusion Services (NBTS) to recruit and retain blood donors, according to Medical Services minister Anyang\u2019 Nyong\u2019o.\nThe disclosure comes at a time when many myths about the disease have been debunked and the infection rates have been declining.\nStatistics from NBTS show that the prevalence of HIV among blood donors is currently at 1.3 per cent, down from 6.4 per cent in 1994 due to proper donor selection practices. \nThe country has been unable to meet its annual target of 380,000 units of blood due to unfounded fears by donors that they would be informed of their HIV status, Prof Nyong\u2019o said.\nSome people were in the habit of \u201choarding\u201d blood to donate later to a family member, he told the launch of a campaign dubbed \u201cKnow your blood group\u201d aimed at reversing the worrying trend of declining blood supply on Friday evening.\nThe minister called on all Kenyans to take blood donation as a personal responsibility to save lives.\nNoting that one third of transfused blood was utilised by children with anaemia while 15 per cent was used for the management of pregnancy- related anaemia, Prof Nyong\u2019o underscored the need to save lives of children and women in danger.\nGrave danger\n\u201cThe survival of our nation is dependent upon women and children who are in grave danger if we don\u2019t donate blood,\u201d said the minister at the Sarova Stanley Hotel.\nHe called on volunteer organisations involved in mobilising blood donations to mount aggressive campaigns to boost supplies.\n\u201cThis country cannot depend on donors for such basic services as blood transfusion,\u201d he said in reference to the heavy reliance on donor agencies such as the Centre for Disease Control and the Presidential Emergency Funds for Aids Relief. \nThe minister said although the current funding of NBTS was about to end, there was a possibility of additional funding for a further five years."}
