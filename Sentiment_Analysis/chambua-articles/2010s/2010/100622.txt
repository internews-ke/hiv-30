{"text": "June 22,\u00a02010\nYou need lots of courage to fight HIV to fight this deadly virus \nBy ASUNTA WAGURA\nRecently, I went for a blood count analysis to establish my immunity, or, as we in the HIV world put it, \u201chow Aids is making merry in my system\u201d. \nI had good reasons for doing this. I had suffered from persistent cold and chest infections that wouldn\u2019t heal, no matter what drugs I used.\nWithin my circle of friends, bound by our HIV-positive status, we sometimes crack jokes that make new members in our group therapy sessions cringe. \nIt\u2019s not unusual to hear a member asking another why she\u2019s so selfish not to donate blood yet she has so much, only to hear the other retort that her blood contains so much poison that the doctor would only flush it down the drain. \nSo when my friends started teasing me that I was \u201cgoing\u201d, and that I should put my house in order, I was not amused. They didn\u2019t know that the joke was making the soldier in me freak out.\n\u201cYako imefika mwisho,\u201d they kept joking, meaning my virus had reached the end of the road, as I coughed my poor lungs out. \nI know better than to take such comments seriously, but, inwardly, I was deeply worried. Fortunately, things were not as bad as they seemed. My CD4 count was 467. \nPlus, I had an undetectable viral load. As I left the doctor\u2019s room with the usual lie that I would return on the appointment date, I was relieved that my health was still stable.\nI have friends who have lived with this virus for years and have nothing to show that they are infected. They are not on antiretroviral therapy, drink alcohol, violate almost all the rules in the book, yet they look as healthy as ever. \nI\u00a0also have other friends who, despite\u00a0walking down the narrow road, are the first culprits of opportunistic infections like tuberculosis. Some don\u2019t last long before losing the battle. Sometimes these ironies leave me with more question marks than full stops. \nBecause of the questions I\u2019m asked, it\u2019s proving impossible for me to build standard foundation of thoughts about HIV. In some forums, some people address me as \u201cDaktari\u201d, which makes me almost laugh. But what is clear is that this battle needs devotion and courage. \nI usually tell those directly affected to build a devoted relationship with this virus, (never mind that I sometimes doubt mine). By this I mean to abide by the accepted and scientific rules to live longer. And I advise those not free of the virus to take every measure not to be infected. \nOne of my close friends told me he thinks that this virus is utterly dependent on forces outside us. He compared those affected by the virus to a farmer who cultivates his field and sows the seeds, knowing all too well that in the final analysis, she is dependent on circumstances beyond his control, that is, good weather. \n\u201cUnfortunately, there are no green houses for HIV management,\u201d he remarked, arguing that some people succumb to the virus very easily while others rise above the outside forces. \nHe was referring to those of us who are infected, saying that unless we diligently pursue our full responsibility and take care of ourselves the best we can, the battle will be very tough. \nHe needed my opinion as an \u201cexpert\u201d in this field. I wish they knew that my \u201cexpertise\u201d comes from the number of years I\u2019ve clocked with this virus. \nIt\u2019s not as bad as it used to be. In those days myths were the order of the day, and I even drank my own urine believing it was a cure. \nAnd the cost of ARVs was very high, leading to the deaths of many of my colleagues. These days, ARVs are easily accessible. So generally, things have changed for the better. \nI need not tell you the answer I gave my friend. However, one thing was certain; as the years go by, HIV is bringing with it lots of challenges needing a high level of courage and study. Paths are made by walking. The walk has been long, but the path is there, and it\u2019s beaten by those of us who are still alive.\nLet\u2019s take courage, and make the path safe for those using it by removing the obstacles lon the way.\u00a0 Let\u2019s not allow fear to dominate the way for this will make the problem worse. Fear says, \u201cRun!\u201d, but courage stops and fights back.\nasuntawagura@hotmail.com \nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother of two who tested positive 23 years ago.
