{"text": "Every Woman Needs A Man, Even The HIV-positive\nOctober, 6, 2010\nBY ASUNTA WAGURA\nONE WOMAN, a doctor, summed up what\u00a0I have many times tried to explain. I could never get the right words and I ended up saying the wrong thing.\nNo matter what a woman has, whether money or social status, there is one area that these do not fulfill. \nAnd, as the doctor put it, this is why you\u2019ll find\u00a0a \u201csuccessful\u201d woman having a relationship with\u00a0another woman\u2019s man, or an unfulfilled woman filling the gap with, say, her garden boy. \nThis hit home. If this doesn\u2019t apply to many women out\u00a0there, it applies squarely to me. \nFor the longest time, I bragged that I could do without a man. \nAfter all, I had all that I thought I wanted. That was before I woke and smelled the coffee. \nFor us people living with HIV/Aids (PLWHA), thinking about getting into a relationship or married means also taking into account that not-so-silent third partner called HIV. I always say that, to PLWHAs, the virus must be given due attention and priority. \nIf the virus is banished into the realm of silence and whispers, it leads to artificial and unnecessary death in marriage. \nAs Richard tells me whenever there is friction between us, \u201cLet\u2019s go slow on this. Remember we need to die a natural death. Let\u2019s not force this virus to create an artificial death by offering it stress... our children need us now and many years to come.\u2019\u2019 \nMany HIV couples come to me when things are out of control. As an outstanding figure in this field, many have put their faith in me to get their courtship back on track when things get tough. I can proudly say that many have walked out of my office holding hands, smiling. \nOne cannot underestimate the impact of HIV/Aids in relationships. I have played enabler and connector to many HIV-positive partners. Many who come to me regard me as the \u201cmother\u201d and counsellor in HIV/Aids matters.\nLittle do they know that I, too, have relationship issues. From these meetings, I have learned that there is more than meets the eye in our type of relationships.\nFor people living with HIV, that status by itself creates an obstacle on the path to finding a suitor to share love and a life with. \nI was in those shoes for many years and now I\u2019m happy as I celebrate the fifth year with my partner. \nI remember how I was ostracised because of my relationship with Richard, just because of the age difference (he is a dozen years younger than me).\nLooking back, I can say that no matter how many obstacles came my way, I have something to be grateful for. \nI am at peace with myself. Each day there is evidence that our relationship, which has had a lot of scrutiny, is bringing forth happiness and a healthy life. \nLooking at my children, my heart is filled with joy and I thank God for the resolute action I took to move out of the lonely domicile my HIV status had confined me to.\nMy relationship has come across a myriad stumbling blocks, which my partner and I have managed to roll aside \u2014 not easily, though. The virus made us compatible. \nI can bet that if it were not for this virus, Richard and I would be poles apart. When I was first diagnosed with HIV, I was an inspiring young woman studying nursing, my dream career. \nNothing could have stopped my burning ambition. Until I was told my studies had come to an abrupt end and that I should go home and die. My world came tumbling down. \nOn the other hand, Richard was a happily married young man with a promising future, until they discovered that he and his partner were living discordantly. His partner opted out. \nFor us, the virus was a stepping stone to our union. And for two people with similar goals, and a bright future cut short by the realisation of being HIV positive, what could have prevented a union after a date at one of the coolest hotels in the city on that cool July day five years ago? \nCertainly not age difference \nI give Richard credit for our union because I nearly quit due to our age difference and the fear of what people would say. Many times we pretended to be cousins, but that didn\u2019t work for long.\nWhat sort of cousins hold hands and display such intimate affection? \nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother of three who tested HIV-positive 23 years ago. She is the executive director of the Kenya Network of Women with Aids (KENWA)."}
