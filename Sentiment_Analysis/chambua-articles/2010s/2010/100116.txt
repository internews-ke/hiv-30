{"text": "January 16,\u00a02010\nYoung and living positively with HIV \nadvertisement \nBy WANGECHI WAHOME\nReports on the rate of HIV infections in Kenya released early last week painted a gloomy picture on the fight against HIV and Aids.\nFor every HIV positive person who is put on medication, four more adults are infected, according to UNAids.\nThe total number of people living with HIV in the country is estimated to be 1.2 million. \nAnd, according to the Special Programmes minister, Dr Naomi Shabaan, 80 per cent of Kenyans do not know their HIV status and the youth are the majority.\nDespite the grim statistics, a group of young people who form the Positive Youth Initiative (PYI) have come together to show that life continues even after being infected with HIV virus.\nPYI is a youth-only support group for people infected with HIV and also takes in its wings those who have been affected by the disease. It currently has over 200 members.\nSays its national co-ordinator Georgina Nakitare: \u201cThere was a need to cater for the youth because the issues they face are very different from those faced by the older generation.\u201d\nShe continues: \u201cThese are people who discover they are HIV positive when they are in their prime, it is not fair to mix them up with the older people.\u201d\nGeorgina, 27, says this from her own experience. She discovered she was HIV positive when she was 20 years old and was on a visit to an ante-natal clinic as she was expecting her first baby.\nShe only shared the information with her boyfriend and thereafter they agreed to keep it to themselves. She got a baby girl and, a short while after, she lost both her boyfriend and her child to Aids.\nThe loss made her go into depression which resulted in a stroke. It is only then that she let her family know what was going on and that was the beginning of a new life for her.\n\u201cThe support I got from my family made me realise that I still had a chance to make something out of my life,\u201d she says.\nHer father asked her what she wanted to do in college while she was still in hospital and she knew that she wanted to help other young people who were facing the challenges she had gone through.\nAt 22, she enrolled at a Nairobi college for a course in community service and was one of the founder members of PYI. \nThere she exchanged ideas with other young people who were HIV positive and helped counsel others who were yet to come to terms with their status. \nShe is also a community health worker and helps those infected with HIV and Aids in different parts of Nairobi.\nThough she would not wish it on anyone, she considers her status a blessing in disguise because, through her experience, she has been able to help a lot of people. \nPYI holds meetings every week and provides counselling and medicine to young people aged between 16 and 30.\nThe Sunday Nation attended a group counselling session at Coptic Hospital on Ngong Road and, save for the agenda of the meeting, there was nothing to give away that the young people in attendance are all living with the HIV virus.\nAt 30, Kennedy Gor lives a charmed life with his wife and child.\nKennedy was told 10 years ago that he would not live long after he tested positive after a mandatory HIV test.\n\u201cI was supposed to go to India for studies and I was required to take a mandatory HIV test,\u201d he says. \nHe accepted his status eventually because of support from his family.\nHis parents, especially his father, gave him the boost he needed to go on with his life. He enrolled for a computer engineering course and he now works for the Movement of Men Against Aids in Kenya.\nHe was one of the founder members of PYI and still continues to give counselling to young people found to be HIV positive.\nMercy Apondi was the youngest member of PYI at the meeting. She is 21 and found out she was HIV positive two years ago.\nApondi says shyly: \u201cI began getting sickly in 2007 and when I was taken to hospital, I was advised to go to a VCT.\u201d \nShe was accompanied by an aunt and, on testing, she was told she was HIV positive.\nApondi was advised to join PYI at the counselling centre. Her life has not been as difficult as it was for Nakitare and Gor since she joined immediately.\nEric Owayo, the only other male member of the group, found out he was HIV positive in 2008 while still in high school.\nThe counsellors went to their school and he went for the test because of advice a teacher had given his class.\n\u201cHis words kept coming back to me and I knew I needed to know my status,\u201d he says.\nHe immediately joined a support group just like Apondi.\nBut for Nancy Atieno, 23, and Sharon Nyambura, 25, this was not the case. \nAtieno had a persistent cough in 2004. Her health kept on deteriorating and eventually she had to be taken to hospital. The counsellors chose to reveal her HIV status to a brother who had accompanied her to the hospital.\nHe kept the report from her but kept on insisting that she visit a VCT. \n\u201cI had a feeling that I was HIV positive but I did not want to confirm my fears,\u201d Atieno says.\nThe treatment she got at the hospital where she had first been tested is what made her suspicious. \n\u201cI think my brother could not face me with the news but you cannot blame him, he is not trained in these matters,\u201d she says.\nAtieno eventually had to face the music when she got sick again and was advised to visit a VCT. She was accompanied by her cousin this time round and when she learnt of her status, it was not much of a shock.\n\u201cIt was relief because finally I could get some help and know how to live with my status. I went to a women\u2019s support group and I was advised to join PYI. My health has also improved and I have been married for two years to a wonderful man,\u201d she says.\nIn Nyambura\u2019s case, she had gone for an ante-natal clinic three years ago when she was told she had to take an HIV test.\n\u201cInstead of informing me, the counsellors chose to tell my sister who is a community health worker,\u201d she says.\nThe counsellor told her after she had already informed her sister. She was not aware that her sister knew and kept the information known only to her and her husband.\nThe fact that her husband was not infected with HIV caused marital strife in their home and Nyambura\u2019s health deteriorated very fast. \nShe found out that her sister knew about her status when she insisted on taking her to a hospital to have her CD4 count checked. By that time, she was very weak.\nShe was put on medication immediately and her condition improved. Today, she is a mother of a two-year-old HIV negative baby. \nNyambura and her husband have also received counselling on how to live as a discordant couple.\nLosing a person close to you through death is a hard thing to deal with but Hilda Anyango, 29, and Mary Njeri, 26, have had to deal with losses brought on by HIV and Aids.\nAnyango lived in denial for three years after testing positive to HIV during a routine ante-natal check-up six years ago.\n\u201cI did not tell anyone, even my husband. I kept it to myself and continued with life as normal,\u201d she says.\nThe disease soon caught up with them when Anyango got tuberculosis and was advised to go for a HIV test.\n\u201cI went back home and told my husband what I had been advised and he initially refused to accompany me to a VCT,\u201d Anyango says. \nThe results only confirmed what she already knew and she pressed her husband to go for a test too.\nHe was found positive but he never really accepted his status. He went to work in Uganda and came back bed-ridden because he was not on any medication.\n\u201cHe died last year and it is only then that I started taking care of myself since I did not want to leave my child without a mother,\u201d she says.\nLike Anyango, Njeri\u2019s boyfriend died in 2005 and then she started getting sickly. \nShe kept to herself and had to be forced by a community health worker to go to a VCT where she tested positive. \nThe PYI meeting ends with a discussion about members\u2019 love lives. Two members are married to HIV negative partners."}
