{"text": "November 19,\u00a02010\nAids, TB cutting life expectancy of Swaziland\u2019s people \nHIV/Aids and tuberculosis are killing adults in Swaziland, reducing people\u2019s life expectancy from 60 years to just 31 and pushing many children to orphanages.\nAs a result, the adult workforce is declining and children are joining the labour force so as to feed themselves and go to raise money for school, according to a recent report by an international medical group.\nIn the report titled \u201cFighting a dual epidemic: Treating TB in a high HIV prevalence setting in rural Swaziland\u201d, released on Thursday, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said a dual epidemic of TB and HIV/Aids is devastating the Southern African kingdom, calling for \u201curgent political commitment translated into immediate action.\u201d\n\u201cSwaziland has the highest HIV prevalence in the world among adults. Disturbingly, more than 80 per cent of TB patients are also co-infected with HIV,\u201d Aymeric Peguillan, MSF\u2019s head of mission in Swaziland, said during the report launch.\nHighest in the world\nAccording to United Nations health reports, the HIV/Aids infection rate in Swaziland is unprecedented and the highest in the world at 26.1 per cent of adults and over 50 per cent of those in their 20s.\nThe report recommends the government take urgent practical action in response to the major health emergency needed in the country.\nSwaziland is a small country, with no more than 200 kilometres north to south and 130 kilometres east to west. The western half is mountainous.\nSwaziland is the only remaining Southern Africa kingdom with a population estimated at 1,077,000.\n\u201cLife expectancy has halved within two decades, plummeting from 60 to just 31 years. People are dying in large numbers, and tuberculosis is currently the main cause of mortality among adults,\u201d Peguillan said.\nAs a result, many children are being made orphans and the adult workforce is declining,\u201d she added.
