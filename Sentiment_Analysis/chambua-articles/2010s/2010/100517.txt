{"text": "May 17,\u00a02010\nSh18bn to help Aids patients and feed the hungry \nBy ALPHONCE SHIUNDU\nThe government is seeking Sh18.1 billion to help vulnerable Kenyans in the next two years.\nThe money will be used in the war against Aids, assist people displaced by post-election violence and provide relief food to the poor.\nInitially, the Treasury had allocated only Sh7.3 billion to the sector and the new wish list means it has to find an extra Sh10.8 billion.\nThe government report for the special programmes sector shows that the bulk of the money will go towards buying anti-retroviral drugs for Aids patients, while the rest will be split to cater for displaced people and to shore up the strategic grain reserves.\nGovernment\u2019s forecast \nAccording to the government\u2019s forecast for the sector prepared in February, the increased budget for the national campaign against Aids is \u201cdue to the shift from awareness creation to effective support to the (Aids patients)\u201d.\nThe maize shortage in the strategic grain reserves is also a concern given that the silos are currently under-stocked \u2014 far below the eight million bags required.\n\u201cArising from the protracted drought and rising poverty levels, the number of people in need of emergency relief food support is on the rise. The latest assessment has put this number at a conservative four million but the real numbers could be in excess of 10 million facing starvation countrywide,\u201d reads the forecast that was prepared before the country enjoyed good rains that have caused a glut in the food market.\nThe government had set aside just Sh5.4 billion to help ensure food security, but the report contends that with the new realities, the amount is not enough.\nEthnic violence\nAlso to benefit from the Sh18.1 billion kitty are the country\u2019s displaced, who are still suffering the effects of the post-election violence in late 2007 and early 2008.\n\u201cContrary to the expectation that the resettlement of the displaced people was a short-term phenomenon, the latest experience has shown that this project will be around for a while,\u201d the report notes. \u201c The construction of houses has attracted the African Development Bank with a two-year financial support. There is also the new dimension of purchasing land to conclude the resettlement exercise.\u201d\nThe subtle warning to the Treasury is that disasters will happen whether the money is there or not. So it is upon the Treasury to prepare for emergencies. If adequate funds are available, then mitigation will be started well in advance, to minimise the impact of disasters.\nThe report adds: \u201cIt would be interesting to note that these emergencies were always foreseen and planned for, but unfortunately, funds were never provided in the budgets. For example, in the 2009/10 period, the emergencies that sector experienced in terms of drought and famines were foreseen well in advance and prioritised in the sector for funding, which was never to be. Ironically, additional resources were later mobilised to the tune of Sh24 billion.\u201d\nIn government-speak, special programmes sector is not all about disasters and relief services, but also the youth, unemployment crisis, equality and key aspects of socio-economic development.\nApart from the Ministry of Special Programmes, other ministries in this sector include: Regional Development Authorities; Gender, Children and Social Development; Youth Affairs and Sports; and Development of Northern Kenya and other Arid Lands.\nBut even with the call for increased funding for ARVs, it is the youth empowerment that is given priority in the sectoral report, whose theme is: Achieving Economic Growth Through Targeted, Effective and Efficient Public Spending.\nThe focus is youth employment policies and a push for entrepreneurship through the revolving Youth Enterprise Development Fund.\nThe government report estimates that at least 500,000 jobs had so far been created through the fund set up in 2006. In the current financial year, the Treasury gave the fund that has more recently been in the news for its high default rate, Sh721 million.\n\u201cBy June 2009,\u201d the report notes \u201cthe fund had disbursed Sh1.25 billion to over 65,000 youths across the country\u201d.\n\u201cTraining for youth entrepreneurs is being done to enable them to creatively engage in economically viable activities. The start-up capital disbursed to the youth and youth groups will have a multiplier effect, thus enabling creation of more jobs,\u201d notes the report.\nFinancial period\nThe sector pats itself on the back for its performance over the last financial period, saying that all the projects it undertook had \u201cmajor impact on people\u2019s livelihoods\u201d.\nThe thrust of the government\u2019s gloating is that livestock was saved from the famine, a huge chunk of the displaced people were resettled, new jobs were created and that a good number of people rose above the poverty line.\nPerhaps knowing that the taxman is not collecting adequate revenue, the sector now wants the private entrepreneurs to be enjoined in the government projects that require huge amounts of money.\nThe Treasury is also on the cross hairs for the slow disbursement of funds to the programmes under this sector. The problem is that the monthly and quarterly exchequer releases are not in tandem with the cash-plans of many of the programmes under the sector.\nBut it is not all about the money. Staff recruitment and the tools needed to do the job are also a priority for the sector.\nThe overlap in projects \u2014 where several ministries and even the Constituency Development Fund target the same project \u2014 also has to be quashed if the arid areas are to get any meaningful development.\nIn order of priority, the youth initiatives rank top, followed by children\u2019s services, while special initiatives for northern Kenya and other arid lands comes in at number three. \nGender and social development takes the fourth place, disaster management comes in at number five while the integrated regional development authority comes in at number six.\nThe least urgent initiative of the sector is sports facilities.\nThis comes as bad news for Kenya\u2019s sportsmen and women, especially at this time when the continent is engulfed in the 2010 World Cup frenzy, and Kenya is getting ready to host the Africa Senior Athletics championship.\nKey considerations \nThe criterion for the ranking is based on the project\u2019s relevance from the Kenya Vision 2030 lens. \nOther key considerations for ranking a project are its ability to address poverty, unemployment, marginalisation, food security, and the ministry\u2019s core mandate. The ability to mitigate against disasters is also an indicator.\nWith the reading of the Budget slated for next month, the march towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals is on, as the 2015 deadline approaches.\nTo win this fight, it is all about money for the projects under this sector, the right people doing the right jobs, and using the right tools."}
