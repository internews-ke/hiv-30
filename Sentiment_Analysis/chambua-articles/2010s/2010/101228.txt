{"text": "December 28,\u00a02010\nLiving every day like it is New Year\u2019s Day \nBy ASUNTA WAGURA\nAnother New Year is here with us, and I know that most of us have gone into overdrive, making resolutions and swearing that this time round, they are carved on stone. \nThat\u2019s why I want to do things differently. This past year has been good to me, but that\u2019s not to say that I have not had my fair share of trials. \nUnlike most persons who are living with HIV (PLWHs), I can say that I am hugely blessed. For starters, God has made me see and savour more years than some of the women I started this journey with. If there\u2019s anyone who can write a book on longevity against all odds, then it should be me. \nSo, come 2011, I want to live every single blessed day like it is New Year\u2019s Day. I want to do things differently because I want to find new purpose in my life.\nFor some time, I felt like my life was like a caboose that had veered off the rails and was hurtling downhill. That\u2019s one of the reasons I decided to go to Southern Sudan and see if I could find new rhyme and reason. \nLiving every single blessed day like it is New Year\u2019s Day means that, with every decision concerning my life, it will be the engine and not the caboose. As a PLWH, it is easy to be passive \u2014 to be a caboose \u2014 and let others take charge of your life, and there is the temptation to just lie on the rails and let yourself be dragged along. \nSometime this year, I decided to sit in the driver\u2019s seat in the engine room and guide my train to newer destinies, the way I did 20 years ago. I had become somewhat complacent. That\u2019s what happens when you have been doing the same thing for many years.\nI got to that point where, without even knowing it, I had delegated almost everything. I would sit in the caboose and the train would still run smoothly. \nLiving every single blessed day like it is New Year\u2019s Day means taking cognisance of the little things that, for some time now, I have been taking for granted.\nMy pastor loves saying that it costs God something to keep us alive and that we don\u2019t know, for instance, the angel of death that He makes to pass over our abodes. \nAnd for someone who has been in the crosshairs of the angel of death for over two decades, I would be a fool to kill time, although it\u2019s something that some of us unconsciously do. I want to make the best of every moment that God gives me and, henceforth, not look back and rue the missed opportunities. \nThe new blessings and challenges that have lately come to my life have woken me up. The work that I\u2019m doing in Southern Sudan means that I do things differently from the way I used to.\nIt behoves me to adjust my attitude because, as someone once said, \u201cattitude is like a car with a flat tyre; you ain\u2019t going nowhere till you change it\u201d. \nI must admit that my new baby, Israel, also has a lot to do with my resolution to live every single blessed day like it is New Year\u2019s Day. Like all mothers know, our babies\u2019 developmental milestones are like shooting stars: they zoom through our lives and we have to savour them and make our wishes real quick. \nAt times work-related travel takes me miles away from my children, making me miss some of those rare moments. I can\u2019t put the feelings of loss into words and every time I hear my children\u2019s voices on the other end of the phone, I try not to break down.\nThat\u2019s why this year, whenever I\u2019m spending time with them, I\u2019ll switch off my phone and savour every moment without interruptions. \nI have lived more than nine lives and I\u2019m not afraid of death the way I was when I tested positive and was given only six months to live. That said, in my line of work, death is ever present. It\u2019s a constant reminder that I owe my Creator tonnes of gratitude, which I will never be able to pay. \nAs I was writing this, the faces of some of the women we started out with kept flashing before my eyes. They were gone too soon and I know that I\u2019m fortunate to still be here. And that\u2019s the more reason why I want to live every single blessed day like it\u2019s New Year\u2019s Day. \nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother-of-three who tested HIV-positive 23 years ago. She is the executive director of the Kenya Network of Women with Aids (KENWA)."}
