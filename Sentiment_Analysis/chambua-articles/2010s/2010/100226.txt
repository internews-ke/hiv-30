{"text": "February 26,\u00a02010\nAlarm as HIV rises among gays \nBy GITONGA MARETE and GALGALO BOCHA\nA surge in the HIV infection rate among homosexuals is likely to send government and community health workers back to the drawing boards in a bid to address the emerging trend.\nResearch findings released by the Kenya Medical Research Institute (Kemri) show that 15.2 per cent of new HIV infections are being reported among homosexuals.\nAlso worrying is that 60 per cent of these homosexuals engage in sex with married men, a trend that places a large number of Kenyans at risk.\nThis seems to contradict popular belief among Kenyans that gay people have no place in their society and should be condemned. \nA global research by Ottoman LGBT, 2009, puts Kenya at the top of the list, where 98 per cent of the population believes that \u201chomosexuality is a way of life society should not accept\u201d.\nIt is followed by Mali, Nigeria, and Indonesia, with Germany and Italy among the most tolerant of homosexual behaviour.\nReleasing the Kemri report, Dr Mary Mwangome, a researcher, said that a survey conducted in Mombasa District last year found that on a single night, there were 739 men on the streets, offering their services to an average of 2,000 men.\n\u201cThe HIV 1 strain found among the heterosexual population in Kenya is the same one found among homosexuals in the country, which means that the virus circulates among both groups,\u201d she said.\nTwo weeks ago, police in Mtwapa rescued six gay men who were alleged to have been planning a wedding for one of the couples from a lynch mob.\nRestrained\nThe mob was also restrained from burning a Kemri research clinic in the town where the current research \u2014 supposed to have been released at about the same time but officials feared it could have been counter-productive \u2014 was conducted.\nActing Kemri director Solomon Mpoke, in a statement, said that, in collaboration with the Population Council, the clinic in Mtwapa documented 72 locations where homosexuals offer sex services and where 90 per cent of the clients were Kenyans.\nAdvertisement "}
