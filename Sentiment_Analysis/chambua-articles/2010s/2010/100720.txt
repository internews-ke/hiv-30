{"text": "uesday, July 20,\u00a02010\nMSF warns over Aids funds cuts \ncomment \nPrint \nadvertisement \nVienna, Tuesday\nCutbacks in rich-world funding for Aids treatment could sentence millions of sufferers to death for lack of access to anti-retroviral (ARV) drugs, Medecins Sans Frontieres warned Thursday.\n\u201cDonors have started to shift their support away from HIV/Aids, and funding is not keeping up with the need,\u201d the medical charity warned in a report ahead of a major Aids conference in Vienna next week.\n\u201cIf nothing is done, most of (those infected with HIV) will die within the next few years,\u201d it said, in a study based on fieldwork in eight African countries.\nAccording to MSF, many donors have frozen their contribution to the fight against Aids \u2014 partly due to the financial crisis \u2014 with the United States planning to cut its support for ARV drugs in Mozambique by 15 percent over the next four years.\nThe Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria is trying to raise 20 billion dollars (15.5 billion euros) for the next three years.\u2028So far it has received just a few hundred million dollars, the author of the report, Mit Philips, told journalists.\n\u201cIt is a very frustrating feeling to see that in spite of the achievements that have been made... the international donors, for the moment, show less interest and less resolve to continue to support the fight against HIV/Aids,\u201d she said.\nThey want to give up\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if they want to give up the fight halfway through. We want to tell them: \u2018you cannot turn back now on Aids treatment, it\u2019s too important\u2019.\u201d\nMeanwhile, a gel made using the HIV drug tenofovir reduced HIV infections in women by 39 percent over two and a half years \u2014 the first time such an approach has protected against the virus, South African researchers reported yesterday. \nIn addition, the gel reduced the risk a woman would get genital herpes by 51 percent, a surprise finding that adds further benefits, Dr Salim Abdool Karim at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban, South Africa said in results to be released at the International AIDS Conference in Vienna.\nWhile some three million HIV patients now have access to anti-retroviral drugs in Africa, the continent worst affected by the virus, another six million were still without treatment, MSF warned.\nBy reducing funding, donor countries would ensure that even less patients received care, or received it too late, it added in its report.
