{"text": "December 2,\u00a02010\nNew system to speed up HIV testing in babies \nBy GATONYE GATHURA gathura@ke.nationmedia.com\nParents will now be able to know the HIV status of their babies within two days.\nTest results take up to three months to come out. \nBut using a new computer application developed by students at Strathmore University in Nairobi, the Ministry of Public Health and Sanitation will capture, manage and return results in just one or two days.\n\u201cThe turnaround time for test results is especially critical, as infants diagnosed with HIV must begin anti-retroviral treatment as quickly as possible to ensure survival. \n\u201cWithout immediate treatment, half of HIV-positive infants are unlikely to survive past two years,\u201d read a press statement from HP and the Clinton Health Initiative, who are sponsoring the project. \nAnnounced on Thursday as the country observed the World Aids Day, the initiative will test and treat more than 120,000 infants exposed to HIV in Kenya each year. \nThis is expected to save the lives of about 100,000 children each year.\n\u201cWe believe these efforts will facilitate our ability to provide long-term health interventions that truly make a difference in keeping our population healthy and productive,\u201d said Public Health minister Beth Mugo.\nWithin the first year, the project will have delivered test results to 70,000 children under the age of 18 months. \nThe database will be used to communicate with rural health centres via SMS regarding the test results."}
