{"text": "April 27,\u00a02010\nBeing too good to people living with HIV smothers them \nIt was Thomas Carlyle who said, \u201cThe tragedy of life is not so much what men suffer, but rather, what they miss\u201d. \nDerrick*, who reminded me of this quip, called me one Sunday evening. \u201cI want to see you because of what I\u2019m going through, I just can\u2019t take it anymore,\u201d he said.\n\u201cCome and see me on Monday,\u201d I told him.\nWhen he came to the office, he was smart and didn\u2019t look like someone undergoing mistreatment, like he had indicated over the phone. \nAfter the introductions, I asked him about his story. This is normal in our line of work. Most people who come to see me have a story to tell, mostly HIV-related.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t come because I\u2019m being mistreated,\u201d he said. \u201cBut my folks are so good to me that I can\u2019t take it anymore. I no longer feel like I\u2019m capable. It\u2019s as if, all of a sudden, I\u2019ve become disabled.\u201d\n\u201cIt started when I fell sick with tuberculosis and was admitted to one of the private hospitals. During my admission, I lost my job. It was then that I learnt that my family knew of my HIV status, and that they had decided to take over decisions regarding my life without involving me.\u201d\nFor starters, they took all his household belongings \u2013 plus his son \u2013 to his mother\u2019s house. Derrick later learnt that his wife had died, but this information was hidden from him. When he was discharged, he was surprised to see his sister driving him to their mother\u2019s house. \nHe thought they wanted him to visit his mum before going to his own place. And when he insisted that he needed to go home to see his wife and child, everyone looked surprised. \n\u201cBut I later learnt that I had no home, since they had decided I didn\u2019t need one after going through my medical records. Worse still, my wife had died. I was lost for words as I was shown what was to be my bedroom, right next to my son\u2019s.\u201d\nDependant\nDerrick\u2019s family also hired a full-time caregiver for him, who saw to it that he took his medication. Like most people, he was ignorant about anti-retrovirals and had no idea why he had to take so many drugs all the time. His mum\u2019s response was that he was sick, and that he would be all right, but he had to continue taking the drugs.\nOn a review visit, he asked the doctor to tell him exactly what he was being treated for, since his TB therapy was already over. That\u2019s how he learnt about his HIV-positive status.\n\u201cWhat saddens me is that my family decided to take over my life without seeking my opinion,\u201d he said, adding that being under his mum\u2019s roof had reduced him to a dependant.\n\u201cAlthough I\u2019m getting the best of everything, I feel this has completely disempowered me. That\u2019s why I called; I want to be a man and reclaim my life.\u201d\nListening to Derrick\u2019s story, I could tell right off the bat that there was a communication breakdown. Derrick\u2019s family didn\u2019t mean any harm. Still, sometimes too good is not interpreted as good, but as disempowerment. \nThis \u201ctakeover attitude\u201d is common in families that find themselves with a sick member. Their good intentions completely disempower the person, who feels they\u2019re doing it out of pity. Like they say, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. \nPeople who are infected with HIV want to feel they are still in charge of their lives. They want to be right at the centre of making decisions affecting their lives. Any other approach will be misinterpreted.\nWell, I assured Derrick that he could move on like he wanted, but that it would be good to appreciate his family members, inform them about his new move and his reasons for it. He\u2019s now joined one of our support groups and is better equipped with information. \nHe has gone back to his old job and is doing fine with his son. That\u2019s what life is about \u2013 taking charge of your present and laying the course for your destiny.\nIf, for any reason, you feel that your decision is better, it\u2019s still advisable to get the opinion of the infected person. That way, he/she will not feel sidelined or ignored. He/she will feel appreciated, that his/her contribution still counts.\nasuntawagura@hotmail.com\nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother of two who tested positive 20 years ago.
