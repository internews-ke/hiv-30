{"text": "June 29,\u00a02010\nThinking back to the days when testing HIV positive spelt death \n0 Comments \nPrint \nBy ASUNTA WAGURA\nI was astonished to see a news clip on TV about a young man who left more than 150 families homeless in Naivasha after setting himself ablaze in his timber house just because he had tested HIV positive. \nWith all the progress that has been made in managing the virus, that incident was very sad, regrettable and unacceptable, and proves that we still have a lot to do. Stigma is the Goliath that is proving hard to kill. It\u2019s high time we made choices to stop this \u201cPhilistine\u201d who spreads stigma and fear. \nAnd it\u2019s up to us to make a wise choice. We must win, not by suicide or destroying property, but by leaving\u00a0this world a better place. This incident took me back to the bad old days when, if you tested HIV-positive, the focus was on dying, never on living. \nStigma and discrimination were so rife that some people who were infected with HIV jumped to their deaths from the very places that were supposed to provide them with care and support \u2013 hospitals. Those of us who made it survived through God\u2019s grace, making choices and having something to live for. Personally, my son, Peter, was my reason for breathing. \nTo be frank, there were times when I thought it would better to be dead. I thought God had not cut my coat of suffering according to my cloth. I swore that He had given me something that was more than I could bear. It was only later that I realised that His word is true: He never gives us more than we can handle. I learnt that this virus can play nasty tricks on my mind, but when I finally figure it out, my life can be all sweetness and light. \nIt is necessary for us, people living with HIV, to remain alive by any means necessary, and teach others that this thing is tameable, that it\u2019s just another challenge like the thousands of issues out there that give other folks a bumpy ride. I always say that what does not kill me only makes me stronger, and that if I allowed this medical challenge to make me commit suicide, I would be conceding defeat. \nUnwritten agreement\nThis reminds me that in the early days after I resorted to start living positively, I made an unwritten \u201cagreement\u201d with \u201cmy\u201d HIV: that it would be a matter of live and let live between us. I mean, if I died, then the virus would have no place to live. I made the agreement in jest \u2014 although I must admit that at times I used to have a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with the virus \u2014 but looking at the way it has \u201cbehaved\u201d so far, I guess it got the message loud and clear. \nWe\u2019ve made great strides in the recent past, but a lot still needs to be done so that people will not equate HIV seroconversion with a death sentence. I have travelled to almost all corners of this country doing HIV-related work, and it\u2019s sad to see what some of our brothers and sisters are going through just because a virus has compromised their immune system. \nBecause I\u2019ve been there, I\u2019ll play the devil\u2019s advocate. Why, for some people living with HIV who decide to commit suicide, it\u2019s as if they were pushed by fear, isolation and intolerable stigma and rejection. When you don\u2019t have somebody to tell you that this virus is manageable, that there is abundant and productive life even after HIV seroconversion and that acceptance starts with the girl in the mirror, then \u2013 for some folks \u2013 the answer might, unfortunately, lie in a bottle of rat poison. \nHowever, tests like these can be overcome with a mixture of knowledge and hope for a better tomorrow. When I learnt that I could still conceive, and that I could be a productive citizen of this country, I decided to grab the bull by the horns. I am not saying that it\u2019s easy, but I also hate easy things because they disappear just as easily. I learnt the hard way that committing suicide was akin to compounding a problem. \nAnd what Oprah Winfrey said emboldens me to this day: \u201cWhat I know for sure is this: there is no big secret in life. Whatever your goal, you can get there \u2013 as long as you are willing to be honest about the preparation and work involved. There are no back doors, no free rides. There\u2019s only you, this moment, and a choice.\u201d\nasunta@hotmail.com\nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother of two who tested positive 23 years ago.
