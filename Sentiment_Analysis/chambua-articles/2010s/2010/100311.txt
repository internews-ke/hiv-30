{"text": "Swelling number of pregnant HIV positive women baffles experts\u2028By DAVID NJAGI\u2028March 11 2010 \u2028\u2028A sharp rise in pregnancies among women on anti-retroviral treatment in Kenya\u2028and several other African countries has medical researchers baffled. The women\u2028have been found to be twice as likely to become pregnant compared to those not\u2028on medication, says a study published recently in the Journal of Medicine.\u2028\u2028Researchers are worried that the increased pregnancies could lead to a rise in\u2028HIV positive babies. Of an estimated 1.5 million women who get pregnant in Kenya\u2028annually, about 100,000 are HIV positive. Studies show that about 45,000 of the\u2028babies they give birth to will be infected.\u2028\u2028In the latest survey, researchers studied the women over a four-year period and\u2028found that nearly a third of those on anti-retrovirals had experienced a\u2028pregnancy. \" The chance of pregnancy increased over time in women on drugs to\u2028almost 80 per cent greater than those not on medication, \" the study says.\u2028\u2028The link between ARVs and the high rate of pregnancy is not clear but experts\u2028think women on medication may feel more motivated to have children as their\u2028health and quality of life improve. \" However, we did not examine how pregnancy\u2028desires and sexual activity of women changed while on ART, and cannot discern\u2028why the medicines are linked to increased pregnancy, \" say the researchers from\u2028the universities of Columbia in the US and Cape Town in South Africa.\u2028\u2028The new development presents a new challenge to HIV programmes to address the\u2028higher fertility and the possibility of increased cases of mother-to-child\u2028transmission. \" HIV care and treatment services must strengthen medical as well\u2028as psycho-social care to address fertility desires and plans for both women and\u2028men with HIV infection, \" the study says.\u2028\u2028For women who do not wish to become pregnant, it is suggested that effective\u2028methods of contraception as well as safe abortion services be made available.\u2028But for women who desire a child, they should be supported in planning a\u2028pregnancy, the choice of anti-retrovirals and when and how to start on\u2028mother-to-child transmission treatment.\u2028\u2028Ideally, pregnant women should visit an ante-natal clinic at 14 weeks so that in\u2028the event they are HIV positive, they are put on treatment to prevent\u2028transmission to the baby. Dr Muraguri, head of the National Aids and\u2028STDs Control Programme, says many HIV positive women in Kenya are not utilising\u2028a family planning programme that is in place.\u2028\u2028Stable relationship\u2028\u2028\" The government has a family planning programme to reduce pregnancies among HIV\u2028positive women but 50 per cent of the women who should be using it are not, \" \u2028says Dr Muraguri. The rise in pregnancy and sexual activity has been found to be\u2028highest among those in stable relationships.\u2028\u2028The researchers sampled women in Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, Cote d'Ivoire, Zambia,\u2028Malawi and South Africa. In Kenya, the study was conducted at the Nyanza\u2028Provincial General Hospital in Kisumu and Mosoriot Rural Health Centre near\u2028Eldoret.\u2028\u2028According to the authors, related studies from Africa suggest that \" HIV might\u2028modify but does not eliminate a broader desire to have children and that ART use\u2028may be associated with increased fertility desire among HIV-infected women\u2028possibly through increased hope and planning for the future \" .\u2028\u2028This means the level of confidence among HIV positive women is being inspired by\u2028the prolonged life that ART services bring, although scientists say there is\u2028still a high risk of the unborn child being infected. \" This study suggests that\u2028starting ART is associated with higher pregnancy rates in sub-Saharan Africa,\u2028nearly doubling the chances of a woman becoming pregnant. \" However, ART reduces\u2028but does not remove the chance of the mother passing HIV to her child at birth, \" \u2028says the study.\u2028\u2028Condom use\u2028\u2028The 4,531 women enrolled for the study at 11 sites in 2003 were issued with a\u2028package of HIV primary care services which included clinical reviews and CD4\u2028cell counts after every six months, but were not counselled on pregnancy and\u2028contraceptive use.\u2028\u2028By the time the research was ending, six to nine of a group of 100 HIV positive\u2028women had conceived in all the countries under the study, except in South Africa\u2028and Rwanda, where the rates were lower.\u2028\u2028It, however, shows that women in the 25 and 35-year age bracket are more likely\u2028to yearn for a baby in all the countries studied, although the level of\u2028education, being married, having a male partner enrolled into an HIV/Aids\u2028programme and use of contraceptives influence the likelihood of an HIV positive\u2028woman getting pregnant.\u2028\u2028\u2028For instance, the study observed that condom use may not necessarily prevent\u2028pregnancy compared to other conventional methods of contraception. \" The high\u2028incidence of pregnancy coupled with the low prevalence of contraceptive use\u2028underscore the importance of addressing fertility-related issues within HIV care\u2028and treatment programmes in sub-Saharan Africa, \" says the study.\u2028\u2028The study recommends the introduction of pregnancy programmes for HIV positive\u2028women and suggests that safe abortion services should be made available for\u2028women who may conceive accidentally through insecure contraception. \" These\u2028findings highlight the importance of pregnancy planning and management as a\u2028critical component of HIV care and treatment services, \" says the study."}
