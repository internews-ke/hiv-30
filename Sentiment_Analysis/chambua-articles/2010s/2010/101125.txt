{"text": "November 25,\u00a02010\nFamilies headed by youths aged 15-24 on the rise due to early sex \nBy ABY AGINA aagina@ke.nationmedia.com\nFamilies headed by youths aged 15 to 24 are on the rise, a study conducted by the Institute of Economic Affairs has revealed.\nThe study that sampled more than 10 million youths last year attributes this to early sex among teenagers indicating 11 per cent of young women and 22 per cent of young men aged between 15 and 24 had their fist sexual intercourse before the age of 15.\nThe outcomes of the study have raised concern over the modes of parenting being practised in the country that boasts a population of 38 million.\nThe report says that teenage pregnancy is higher in urban than rural areas, and casts blame on parents over negligence of roles. \nMs Katindi Sivi from the IEA while presenting the report on Wednesday at the Stanley Hotel in Nairobi pointed out that 32 per cent of uneducated teenagers had begun child-bearing compared to 10 per cent of those with some secondary education.\nMs Sivi, the lead author of the report titled Youth Fact Book: Infinite Possibility or Definite Disaster noted that lack of education and poverty was the lead component behind the rapid upsurge of young families.\nOther factors responsible for the early marriages according to the report were high unmet need for planning by women, and low use of contraceptives.\nThe underage-led families, according to the study, indicates that young people living in rural areas tend to initiate sexual activity earlier than their counterparts in towns.\nMore young men than women in all the regions sampled engage in high risk sex with respective percentages in Nyanza 88, Central 86.8, and Western 86.4. \nCondom use, according to the report, was regarded unpopular among the youths. About 41 per cent of men aged 15 to 34 believed that use of contraceptives among women could lead to promiscuous behaviour with 15- to 19-year-olds believing use of contraceptives is the business of women.\nAnother disclosure by the fact book shows that more men aged 15 to 49 engaged in transactional sex, which involves exchange of sex for money. Despite the high risk of contracting HIV, men aged 25 to 29 years have an affinity to procuring sex.\nDivorced men, separated or widowed, were the highest at 7.7 per cent according to the report, while wealthy and educated men came second. \nInterestingly, young women aged 15 to 34 in town preferred to have three children whereas their counterparts in rural areas prefer four, said the report.\nThe study also showed that spousal violence was common among the young families with more of the women approving of being beaten by their spouses over reasons such as burning food, child neglect, going out without their spouses\u2019 consent, with refusal to have sex taking the lead.\nOther revelations from the fact book show that clothes teenagers wear are highly influenced by their parents, peers, and self. What a parent wears had a 32 per cent effect on what a teenager would wear. But with increasing instances of rape and child defilement, the parents ought to be on the watch over what their wear.\nOther sources of dressing among teenagers were from movie celebrities, music videos and new design labels. \nOn another front, the fact book showed that the most admired personality among the youths was President Barack Obama taking 30 per cent, while fathers came in second at 10 per cent followed by mothers at 9 per cent.\nIn the report, less women feared death than men, but both men and women equally feared failure. Other fears and worries from the report that youth dread are HIV, poverty and rape.\nYouths aged between 17 to 19 years heavily spent their pocket money on snacks, airtime, cyber caf\u00e9, food, clothing, transport and outings.\nYouths drinking alcohol according, to the fact book, shows that 67 per cent of 17- to 19-year-olds are bought for alcohol by other people, and 75 per cent are bought for cigarettes by friends.\nSelf-buying alcohol stands at 33 per cent and that of cigarettes at 25 per cent. \nFurther insight of the study reveal that 31 per cent of 17- to 19-year-olds influenced themselves into drinking and 17 per cent into smoking. This shows that most drinkers were self influenced contrary to mob influence."}
