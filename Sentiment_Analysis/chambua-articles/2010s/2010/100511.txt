{"text": "May 11,\u00a02010\nLighting a candle for a fallen mentor\nBy ASUNTA WAGURA\nThe International Aids Candlelight Memorial is one of the world\u2019s oldest and largest grassroots mobilisation campaigns for HIV/Aids awareness.\nStarted in 1983, the Memorial is celebrated every third Sunday in May, and aims to honour the lives lost to Aids and raise social consciousness about the virus. \nThis year\u2019s theme is \u201cMany lights for human rights\u201d, which is calls for\u00a0collective action in the drive for access to, among other things, care, prevention and elimination of stigma. And this year I want to light very special candles for a fallen friend, Rowlands Lenya, who died in October last year.\n\u201cThe first thing I\u2019ll do when I return will be to visit Lenya,\u201d I promised myself early early that month as I travelled to a neighbouring country for an HIV-related workshop. \nI\u2019ll never forgive myself for postponing that visit. I was texting folks back at home when I got the tragic news. \n\u201cRowland Lenya has died early this morning.\u201d That was the message I received on my phone. I re-read it countless times, trembling and sweating. I knew it was a mistake to have travelled without visiting Lenya. \nThe late Lenya was the founder and former CEO of The Association of People with Aids in Kenya (Tapwak). He was also many things to many people, including me: mentor, counsellor and a father figure in the area of HIV. \nWhen we first met, I was this stressed out young woman who hadn\u2019t laughed in ages, and he broke the ice in an unforgettable way. \n\u201cSo, young girl, tell me what happened? Of course, you didn\u2019t take \u2018it\u2019 with tea,\u201d he joked, and sent everyone, except me, into fits of laughter as I searched for words. \n\u201cHata mimi sikutoa kwa kanisa (I also didn\u2019t get infected in church),\u201d he saved me from embarrassment by cracking another joke. \nI tried to regain my dignity by categorically stating that I was \u2018innocent\u2019 when I got infected before I learnt that all the people in the room were living with HIV and Aids (PLWHAs). \n\u201cYou mean PLWHAs can laugh,\u201d I wondered. \nThat first meeting was an eye-opener. It made me realise that, although I had a life-threatening condition, I could laugh my way to a longer life. This virus had robbed me of some things, but I was also giving it a \u201cwalkover\u201d. \nThe people in that room, led by Lenya, taught me that laughter truly is the best medicine, and that I should look for every opportunity to laugh. \nAnd it didn\u2019t stop there\u2026\n\u201cYou, Joe Muriuki and I got infected when it was important, and with the quality virus \u2026 leave alone now when folks are getting infected with the defective virus,\u201d he would joke. \u201cWe got the good quality virus \u2026 the original version!\u201d\n\u201cHow is your ukimwi treating you?\u201d was one of his typical greetings. \u201cTell the virus to be calm because you have things to accomplish and it has no business troubling you until you\u2019re through.\u201d\nAnd whenever I complained about the side effects of the drugs I was taking, he would shoot from the hip: \u201cI\u2019m also taking antiretrovirals, but that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t wake up early to serve important Kenyans who are living with HIV, including you. Or don\u2019t you think they\u2019re important?\u201d \nIt was, therefore, heartbreaking that Lenya slipped through our fingers. He\u2019d been there for so long that we thought he would always be there, that he was too strong to die. \n\u201cIf Lenya can die, who won\u2019t die?\u201d I overheard one of his colleagues whispering, after I went straight to Tapwak\u2019s offices when I returned to Kenya. \u201cAnd if Lenya can succumb, who can we say is strong?\u201d \nI could feel that there was a void. The Kenyan HIV community was now orphaned. The place was no longer the Tapwak I knew. It was cold. \nThat\u2019s what death can do. The capable staff and board members tried to keep the fire burning but the inimitable Lenya spark was missing.\u00a0 \n\u201cPerhaps his shoes were just too big for anyone else to fit in,\u201d I thought sadly. \nThat\u2019s why this year I want to remember Lenya. His life was a candle that shone the light on the paths of hundreds of PLWHs.\nasuntawagura@hotmail.com\nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother of two who tested positive 20 years ago.
