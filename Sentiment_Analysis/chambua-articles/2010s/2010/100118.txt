{"text": "18 March 2010\nAids patients wait for verdict on drugs law\nBy NATION Correspondent\nA group of people living with Aids will next month know whether a case they filed in court challenging a law they say denies them access to life-saving drugs will succeed or not.\nThe group says the Anti-Counterfeit Act will interfere with the importation and sale of generic drugs in so far as the medication may be considered counterfeit.\nAnd in the event this law is allowed it will deny them the highest attainable right to life as the cost of the original drugs might be beyond their means.\nMost of the country\u2019s more than 1.4 million people living with HIV and Aids rely on first line generic anti-retroviral drugs, namely 3TC (lamivudine), AZT (Zidovudine) and NVP (Nevirapine).\nAnd now they are concerned that particular sections of the Act has a potential of endangering their well-being.\nOf major concern to them are sections 2, 32 and 34 which they believe will deny them access to drugs necessary for the fulfilment of the quality of life they are guaranteed under the Constitution.\nThrough their lawyer David Majanja the group said the Act fails to acknowledge and specifically exempt generic drugs from the definition of counterfeit goods. This failure effectively prohibits importation and manufacture of generic drugs in Kenya.\nOne of them said that she had lived with the virus for 19 years and told the court how expensive the drugs were before generics came in. The court will give its ruling on April 23."}
