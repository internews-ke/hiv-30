{"text": "Local babies 'volunteer' for HIV vaccine trials \nApril 21, 2010 \nThe search for an effective HIV vaccine now moves to Kenyan babies, who will for the first time volunteer in studies that will kick off later in the year. Screening of the parents whose babies will participate in the trials is underway at the Kenya Aids Vaccine Initiative (Kavi) offices located within Kenyatta National Hospital. Previously, HIV vaccine trials have been conducted in adults, with babies and adolescents exempted. But this time around 76 babies aged about five months will be the subjects. \n\"The involvement of the infants is to help us understand the best time this vaccine should be given to offer a better immunological response,\" says Prof Walter Jaoko, Kavi deputy director and the vaccine's principal investigator. Many of the current childhood disease vaccines are given to infants to help them develop a stronger immunity against illnesses at a very early age. This forms the basis for testing the HIV vaccine in infants. \nMale partners \u2028According to Prof Jaoko, those being enrolled are pregnant women. So far, 12 such women have been screened to determine if they and their yet-to-be born babies qualify to participate in the study. Unlike in other HIV researches, Kavi scientists are also seeking the consent of the women's male partners before enrolling the infants in the trial. Both the man and the woman are taken through what the research entails, before appending their signatures on the consent form."}
