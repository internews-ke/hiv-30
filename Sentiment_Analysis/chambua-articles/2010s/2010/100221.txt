{"text": "Crisis looms as  surge in HIV patients drains drug stocks\n\u00a0Arthur Okwemba\nFebruary 21\n\nNational Aids Control Council (NACC) wants\u00a0the Government to increase funding for HIV\u00a0treatment now that some main donors have\u00a0expressed intention to pull out.\nThe Central Kenya NACC regional monitoring\u00a0and evaluation officer, James Kiiru, said\u00a0that there will be an increase in Aids related\u00a0deaths if the funding is not sustained.\n\u00a0\nDonors\nThe Clinton HIV/Aids Initiative, which has\u00a0been a main donor in the fight against the disease,\u00a0recently said that it will discontinue its\u00a0support for paediatric antiretroviral drugs.\n\u201cThe country faces a serious sustainability\u00a0problem and we are asking the government to\u00a0put up a trust fund,\u201d said Kiiru.\nNACC says that the government contributes\u00a013 per cent towards the fight against HIV,\u00a0while donors contribute 87 per cent. Future\u00a0funding for HIV/Aids response is now becoming\u00a0increasingly uncertain. Funding.\nSpeaking during a seminar in a Nyeri hotel, Kiiru said that other terminal diseases,\u00a0like cancer, are funded by the ministry of\u00a0health, but HIV has mainly been sponsored by\u00a0donors.\n\u201cHIV treatment costs the patients\u00a0KSh200,000 per month, which most Kenyans\u00a0cannot afford as donors change priorities,\u201d he\u00a0said.\nThe council wants the Government to set\u00a0aside one per cent of its annual budget towards\u00a0the establishment of an Aids Trust Fund.\nGaps\nKiiru said the trust fund will address the financial\u00a0gaps that will be left when donors stop\u00a0sponsoring the HIV programmes.\nThe council is lobbying MPs to pass the Kenya\u00a0National Aids Commission Bill, 2012, to\u00a0convert it and make it independent.\nThe Parliamentary Committee on Health\u00a0has put the bill on its agenda, and the council\u00a0legal officer, Charles Kariuki, said that passing\u00a0the bill will strengthen the NACC.\nHe said the commission will have a wider\u00a0mandate and will be able to hold organisations\u00a0involved in the fight against HIV accountable.\n\u201cWe depend on information presented to us\u00a0by organisations involved in the fight against\u00a0HIV, and sometimes the information is not\u00a0enough,\u201d said Kariuki. He said the commission\u00a0will be able to get waivers on ARVs, adding that\u00a0it will be easier to import the drugs. Kariuki\u00a0said the council, which was established by a legal\u00a0notice, can be disbanded by the president,\u00a0but the commission will be independent.\n\u201cThis means the commission will be independent\u00a0and will have legal powers, unlike\u00a0today when it just has responsibilities without\u00a0power,\u201d he added.\nThere are 1.2 million Kenyans living with\u00a0HIV. Almost half of them are married couples,\u00a0and 81 per cent of the infected do not know\u00a0their status.\n- See more at: http://www.awcfs.org/new/index.php/features/health/hivaids/992-uncertainty-looms-as-hiv-funding-dwindles#sthash.rNjpT5ZM.dpuf"}
