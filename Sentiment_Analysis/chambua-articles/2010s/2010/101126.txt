{"text": "November 26,\u00a02010\nAllowing condom use is promoting infidelity \nThe spread of HIV/Aids cannot be stopped or controlled by the use of condoms.\nIt can only be stopped by people changing their moral behaviour, sticking to their partners or marrying more partners.\nThis is evident in Muslims communities where despite polygamy, the rate of HIV infection is lower than areas dominated by those whose religions don\u2019t allow polygamy.\nI would like to urge my fellow human beings to fear God and be bound by His laws, I find it odd for the Pope to give the go-ahead for his followers to use condoms, this is a way of allowing pre marital sex as long as one will use condoms.\nMWINYI RAMADHANI, Nairobi"}
