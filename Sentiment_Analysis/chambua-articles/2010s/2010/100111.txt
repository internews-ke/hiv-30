{"text": "January 11,\u00a02010\nLifting ban on HIV visitors welcome\nReports that the US will this January end its 22-year ban on people with HIV entering the country is encouraging. It\u2019s a bold step by the Obama administration, and all Americans who have decided to live by facts and not fear. \nIt is the right step towards combating Aids, given that 42 million people are already living with the virus and 25 million orphans are expected this year. This gesture is especially a boost to Sub-Saharan Africa, which has 74 per cent of those infected worldwide, according to the UN.\nI was earlier wondering how a country that has long prided itself as a pillar of human rights could automatically disqualify so many people from entering its borders for the simple reason that they were HIV-positive. \nThe irony is that America has immensely contributed to combating the disease, pumping over $15 billion in five years! President Bush said: \u201cIn the face of preventable death and suffering, we have a moral duty to act, we are acting.\u201d Quite.\nONDUSO BONFACE \u2028Kisii"}
