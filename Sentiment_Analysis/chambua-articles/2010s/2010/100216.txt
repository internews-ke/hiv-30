{"text": "February 16,\u00a02010\nHitch \u2018won\u2019t delay Aids drugs\u2019 \nBy JEFF OTIENO\nSupply of anti-retroviral drugs will not be interrupted despite Kenya missing out on crucial Sh21 billion funding.\nThe Ministry of Public Health on Tuesday said that the country currently had Sh24.67 billion from the Global Fund \u201cwith potential for a lot more in phase two of the grant.\u201d\nThe announcement comes a few days after the government\u2019s application for more funds for HIV/Aids and malaria programmes was rejected by the Global Fund on technicalities and the country\u2019s poor record with the organisation.\nKenya has already appealed the decision.\n\u201cAlthough we have not received official communication from the Global Fund Board on the outcome of both appeals, the government, in collaboration with its partners, has developed a strategy to ensure that our national response to HIV is not interrupted,\u201d said a statement from the ministry.\nCurrently, there are 360,000 patients on ARVs, a programme jointly supported by the government, the US President\u2019s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief, the Global Fund, and the Clinton Foundation.\nThe relationship between Kenya and the fund has been thorny, with the latter accusing the government of failing to use the grants received efficiently and transparently.\nThe statement signed by the ministry\u2019s public relations officer, Mr John Kinuthia, said the extra funding for Round Nine, whose application was rejected, would have been used for prevention and treatment of HIV/Aids and malaria.\nMr Kinuthia said the country was currently implementing the Global Fund Round Seven HIV grants, worth Sh10.4 billion, which runs from June 2009 to May, 2014.\nThe ministry also announced that Kenya recently signed an agreement for Sh202.5 billion with the US government to support HIV programmes. The money will be disbursed in the next five years.\nOn malaria, the ministry said there was a grant worth Sh12.15 billion for medicines, indoor residual spraying, and insecticide treated nets for pregnant women and children.\nThe funding ends next year and Sh7.65 billion has so far been disbursed. A further Sh4.5 billion will be received before the end of the year. \nMore in Section Munya threatens to sue EACC for harassment \nMore in Section Non-accredited colleges to be closed \nadvertisement \nAdvertisement \nMost Popular\n\uf0b7  1 News FULL SPEECH: State of the Nation address \n\uf0b7  2 Politics Bensouda seeks private hearing \n\uf0b7  3 Showbiz Eric Omondi pulls prank on fans with Lupita look-alike \n\uf0b7  4 Politics Women leaders threaten to strip over MP\u2019s remark \n\uf0b7  5 News Baby smashed to death on floor \n\uf0b7  6 News Security heightened over car bomb threat \n\uf0b7  7 Video Mzee Kipaika hosts Uhuru, Ruto for lunch in Kajiado \n\uf0b7  8 World Obama agents sent home from Europe for boozing \n\uf0b7  9 Kilifi Baby mauled to death by dogs in Kilifi \nAdvertisement \nMost Commented\n\uf0b7  1Homosexuality a serious problem as terrorism, says Duale \n\uf0b7  2Uhuru Kenyatta seeks US help to fight terrorism \n\uf0b7  3US centre defends Raila invitation as 'badge of honour' \n\uf0b7  4Thugs turn luxury homes into tombs - Business - nation.co.ke \n\uf0b7  5Gunmen kill two in attack on Kenyan church: police \n\uf0b7  6Seven days to public transport crisis \n\uf0b7  7Kenyans in the US to be issued with IDs: Embassy \n\uf0b7  8Daily Nation: Living - Breaking News, Kenya, Africa, Politics, Business, Sports, Blogs, Photos, Videos \n\uf0b7  9New law allowing polygamy passed - Politics - nation.co.ke \n\uf0b7  10Mother of son with bullet in head died shielding him \n\nPhoto gallery\nSearch for missing Malaysian plane\nAdvertisement "}
