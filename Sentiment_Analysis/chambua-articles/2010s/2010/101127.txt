{"text": "Top of Form\nBottom of Form\nNovember 27,\u00a02010\nChurch must boldly tackle the issue of sex \nBy DOMINIC WAMUGUNDA\nSoon after he became Pope in 1958, John XXIII declared that he would call the council.\nIn the Catholic Church, the council is the highest decision-making body. \nIt is this forum that can bring about fundamental changes affecting the dogma, liturgy and other matters critical to the life of the church.\nThen, the last council had been held more than 100 years before. Those who surrounded John XXIII did not see the point. \nThe church was running well and in their view there was no need to change things. They insisted that the status quo remain. John XXIII, however, stuck to his guns. \nWith this insistence on the part of the Pope, the Second Vatican Council was called. It turned out to be one of the major historical events of the 20th century. \nWith the recommendations of this council, the church entered a new phase in terms of her relationship with other elements of the world community.\nIt brought about a totally new understanding of self on the part of the church and what her true mission in the world is.\nCaptured the imagination\nIn the last week or so, the current Pope, Benedict XVI, has captured the imagination of the world for several reasons.\nOne, the mention of a condom by the Pope immediately calls attention to the subject of sex and sexuality which is often taboo in church circles.\nTwo, the church has been, still is and will continue to be quite conservative in matters to do with contraceptives. \nThree, the world is alive to the whole question of HIV/Aids and the havoc it has caused and continues to cause in places like the African continent.\nSeveral issues come to mind when one thinks critically about this whole matter of the use of condoms. \nThese are issues such as procreation, enjoyment of sex, prevention from infection, the moral teaching of the church, an individual\u2019s faith and adherence to teaching, the management of private space, and so on.\nAll these dimensions of human existence have a bearing on the happiness, or lack of it, of individuals. And authentic happiness has a lot to do with the enjoyment of freedom of choice.\nThis freedom in turn goes hand in hand with attention to duty and responsibility. It would be fallacious to conceive a situation where people live in total freedom without regard to responsibility.\nI have no doubt in my mind that the church has a key role to play in guiding believers on matters of morals and responsible living. \nIndeed the excitement we have seen in the public sphere in view of Pope Benedict\u2019s pronouncement is testimony that a lot of people have an interest in what the church has to say on matters of sexuality.\nI am also convinced that some of the decisions and choices that human beings make are directly related to each individual\u2019s level of empowerment. \nAn empowered individual has better possibilities of taking full charge of their lives than one who is not.\u2028Even as the church teaches on morals and correct living, more effort should be directed towards giving people a secular education that empowers them.\nDr Wamugunda is dean of students and lecturer at the University of Nairobi.
