{"text": "February 1,\u00a02010\nDismiss Aids drugs case, AG tells court \nBy NATION Correspondent\nThe Attorney General wants a case challenging the award of a tender to supply Aids drugs dismissed.\nIf the case continues unresolved, the country risked running short of the life saving medication, the AG said on Monday through State counsel Antony Ombwayo.\nThis means most of the country\u2019s more than 1.4 million people living with HIV and Aids would continue to suffer the shortage of drugs.\nIn the case before a Nairobi court, the Kenya Medical Supply Agency (Kemsa) is seeking to quash a decision compelling it to accept a private firm\u2019s tender documents for the supply of the drugs.\nMr Ombwayo told Lady Justice Jeanne Gacheche that the interests of the association were not those of the public and therefore the case should be dismissed.\nThe court will determine the fate of Kemsa\u2019s case over the supply of anti-retrovirals on February 25.\nThe dispute between Kemsa and the Public Procurements Review Board arose from a board decision to force Kemsa to accept tender documents by a company called Hetero Drugs Limited.\nKemsa had refused to accept the company\u2019s tender documents because it did not comply with procurement rules.\nAccording to Kemsa, the company presented a scanned copy of the price schedule instead of an original copy as required by the law governing procurement.\nBased on this, Kemsa found the bid by Hetero Drugs Limited to have failed to meet the mandatory requirements.\nChallenge\nAggrieved by the decision to reject its bid, Hetero then moved to the procurement appeals board to challenge the decision.\nThe board nullified the award of five tender items and ordered Kemsa to accept Hetero\u2019s bid documents and evaluate all bid documents afresh.\nIn arriving at its decision, the board acknowledged that Hetero had submitted a scanned copy, but ruled that the scanned copy would suffice.\nAccording to Kemsa, the board exceeded its jurisdiction in determining that the price schedule was less important than the tender form."}
