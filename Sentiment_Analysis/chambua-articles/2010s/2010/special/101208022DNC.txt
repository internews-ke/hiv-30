{"text": "BOOK REVIEW | Asunta Wagura overcame stigmatisation from family and society to gain international fame and respect\nAids activist lives her life to the fullest\nsatnation@ke.nationmedia.com\nThere are not many\nKenyans suffering from\na disease who have lived\nsuch a \u2018public life\u2019 like Asunta\nWagura. Asunta has written a\ncolumn for many years in the\nDaily Nation newspaper in\nwhich she literally \u2018updates\u2019\nher readers about her life\nwith HIV.\nTo constantly refer to\noneself in relation to HIV\nand Aids is not an easy task\nin a country where, despite\nsustained campaigns against\nstereotyping and alienation of\nthose ailing with HIV and Aids,\nKenyans still get anxious and\nsuspicious when this subject\nis introduced.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter that such\nreference may not be about a\nperson but just the condition of\nbeing HIV negative or positive\nor of just the fight against\nAids. But Asunta has gone\nbeyond \u2018reporting\u2019 about her\nexperiences in the newspaper\nand written an autobiography,\nFrom Heartbreak to Daybreak\n(Sasa Sema, 2012).\nAsunta, though, is one of\nthe few people in Kenya who\nbelieve and argue that talking\nabout HIV and Aids is among\nthe first significant steps in\ndealing with the condition of\neither being HIV positive or\nliving with Aids.\nShe talks about the \u2018disease\u2019\nin her column, in seminars and\nit preoccupies her in her work\nat Kenya Network of Women\nwith AIDS (Kenwa).\nFrom Heartbreak to Daybreak\ntells of Asunta from when she\nwas born at the Nyeri General\nHospital.\nThe family, like many others,\ndepended on their father for\na livelihood and therefore the\nmother and children went\nwhere the man of the house\nwent.\nThus we see the father as an\nitinerant, looking for jobs in\nKapenguria, Lodwar, Songok,\nNandi Hills and settling in\nNairobi.\nAsunta was \u2018daddy\u2019s girl\u2019\ndespite the father being a\ndrunk and a womaniser. The\nmother, like many women in\nsuch situations \u2018stayed in the\nmarriage to see the children\ngrow up.\u2019\nWorking hard\nAsunta, therefore, saw\nschooling as a way out of the\npoverty that afflicted the family.\nShe worked hard at school,\ngot very good marks CPE, 33\npoints out of maximum of 36,\nand scored a Division Two in\nKCE. Her performance in high\nschool, though, was affected\nby abseentism due to lack of\nschool fees. She only managed\nfour points out of a possible 11\nand missed out on university\neducation.\nThe moment that changed\nAsunta\u2019s life forever, if you\nallow the clich\u00e9, was when she\nwas told she had six months\nto live because she was HIV\npositive whilst training\nto become a nurse at the\nMcDonald School of Nursing,\nNairobi Hospital.\nUndoubtedly Asunta\u2019s life\nbefore this is interesting. But it\nbecomes even more remarkable\nafter this diagnosis.\nHow does a young woman\nsurvive betrayal by a man she\nthought she loved, alienation\nfrom friends, stereotyping and\nstigma by the community,\nincluding the Church, rejection\nby the family, suicidal emotions,\njoblessness, etc?\nHow does one live with the\nknowledge that even if you\nsurvived the six months that\ndoctors have \u2018given\u2019 you, you\nwould still be unacceptable in\nthe immediate community?\nWell, that is what Asunta\novercomes, living on to become\na happy and fulfilled wife and\nmother to three HIV negative\nchildren, a women\u2019s rights\u2019\nactivist and the executive\ndirector of an organisation\nwith an annual budget of about\nSh60 million.\nThe moral of this story is\nthat family and friends are\njust as good as medication\nif one has to heal from a life\nthreatening condition like\ninfection with HIV.\nIndeed in From Heartbreak\nto Daybreak, Asunta\u2019s brother\nRuga is her guardian angel\nwhen the rest of the family and\nthe community reject her.\nThis is a story that has\nto be told and retold for its\ninspiration, education and\nhistorical value; it really doesn\u2019t\nmatter how many times.\nBut Asunta\u2019s story appears to\nhave been published in haste.\nThere are just too many\ninconsistencies, repetitions,\ntoo many interruptions in\nthe flow of the narrative,\nlanguage mistakes litter the\ntext, and in some cases just\ntoo little is offered when we\nexpect more.\nFor instance, the husband,\nMartin, is mentioned in just\nabout three pages of the book;\nand beyond a few mentions\nof her friends who died from\nAids, she doesn\u2019t talk about\nthe impact of the disease in\nher family, community or the\ncountry in general.\nThis leaves the reader\nwondering why such a\nseemingly epic story couldn\u2019t\nhave been told better.\nThe writer teaches literature\nat the University of Nairobi."}
