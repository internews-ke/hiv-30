{"text": "February 16,\u00a02010\nWe should stop demonising gay couples and fight sex pests \nI refer to Tuesday, February 16, 2010 letter to the editor by Jonathan Karanja on the intended gay wedding in Mtwapa. \nHe states that our nation is endowed with people who uphold lofty moral standards. Please wake up and look around you and watch what\u2019s going on in Kenya.\nI wish to ask Karanja why he doesn\u2019t oppose men who are married who sleep with other men, men who batter women, men who rape children and so on.\nThe gays are two consenting adults who will answer to God one day and not man.\nI think Mr Karanja should focus on those who abuse children\u2026let one who has not sinned cast the first stone. \nB. AMENYA,\nNairobi\n***** \u2028I can\u2019t help finding Mr Jonathan Karanja\u2019s comment on the aborted gay wedding so hypocritical. \nWith all due respect, I would advice Mr Karanja to respect people\u2019s sexuality. What Sodom and Gommorah is Mr Karanja referring to? I would like to invite him in the late hours to see the height of prostitution in the same town of Mtwapa. \nWhen the slogan \u201cmpango wa kando\u201d is doing so well even among the married, I think Mr Karanja has a better congregation to address other than the gay. \nThere are so many morally sick people who need your teaching on morality. \nThe gay case is not such an emergency at all.\nCAROLINE GIKUNDA,\nNairobi\n***** \u2028The issue of gay marriages is slowly developing into a time bomb. \nThe matter needs to be taken seriously. What happened at the coast where a gay couple attempted to hold a wedding is proof that the issue cannot be ignored any more. \nWe should not victimise gay couples just because they are of a different sexual orientation which society has termed as immoral and inhuman. We cannot live without them for they are human beings. \nThat does not mean I support their lifestyle. My biggest concern, however, is their health. Does anyone know which hospital or health centre they go to when they fall ill?\nStoning or burning them will not stop their rapid growth; instead they will only go underground. What will happen next?\nThey are at risk of being infected with HIV/Aids or STDs for fear of being victimised by medics and the rest of us. Most of these medical practitioners would not even attend to them. \nThey will look at them as undeserving of care and the effort to fight the spread of HIV/Aids would all be in vain. This would be sad because a lot of investment has been employed both by the Government and the NGOs to fight the scourge. \nThe Government should first come up with special programme by setting up medical centres to look into the issue of gays. \nYou can imagine there are about 70,000 of them in Nairobi, based on a survey carried out recently by a team of doctors. \nWhat about the rest of the country? Don\u2019t you think this is a time bomb? "}
