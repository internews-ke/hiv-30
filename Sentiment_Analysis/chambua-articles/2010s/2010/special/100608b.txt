{"text": "Tuesday, June 8,\u00a02010\nWhy Girl Guides are saying \u2018No\u2019 to sex \n0 \nBy DOROTHY KWEYU\nIn Discovering the Potential of Girl Guides in Schools: A Life Skills Curriculum for Guide Leaders, the Girl Guides\u2019 peer education manual highlights information about abstinence from sex.\nPeople abstain from sex for a variety of reasons:\n\u2022 To protect their health\n\u2022 To adhere to spiritual or moral values\n\u2022 To take control of their lives and feel proud of their decisions\nThe manual proceeds to give the benefits of abstinence:\n\u2022 Offers 100 per cent protection from unplanned pregnancy and STIs (sexually transmitted infections), including HIV.\n\u2022 Allows you to wait until you are physically and emotionally ready to have a baby.\n\u2022 Makes you feel like a stronger person, because you are able to say \u201cNo\u201d.\n\u2022 Shows you are emotionally mature.\n\u2022 Prevents feelings of guilt and shame.\n\u2022 Builds your self-esteem and confidence.\n\u2022 Allows the development of a deeper friendship and love with the other person.\n\u2022 Helps keep families united.\n\u2022 Keeps you focused on school and your future.\n\u2022 Is free from side effects.\n\u2022 Is not a permanent contraceptive and is controlled by the individual, who decides when and for how long.\nBut it doesn\u2019t come easy, as can be seen from a recent Daily Nation story on a research that showed that college girls are engaging in unprotected sex (that is, they are not saying \u201cNo\u201d), and using the morning-after pill, which should not be treated as a contraceptive.\nTherefore, an important sub-topic in the manual is communication skills under \u201cFriends and relationships\u201d. \nUnder this topic, the girls are taught to be assertive and to say \u201cNo\u201d in manner that is firm but not rude or threatening; to stand up for their opinions without overshadowing the rights of others and to have a strong, non-threatening body language with a direct, clear and balanced approach."}
