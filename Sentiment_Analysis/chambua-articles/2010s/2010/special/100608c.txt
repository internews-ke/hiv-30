{"text": ", June 8,\u00a02010\nPregnancy rate disrupts Aids vaccine trials \nBy GATONYE GATHURA\nAids vaccine researchers are frustrated by the high pregnancy rates among women participating in clinical trials.\nNow they want abstinence scrapped as a family planning method in future Aids vaccine clinical studies.\nWriting of their frustrations in the current issue of the East African Medical Journal, a team of local researchers led by Prof Walter Jaoko of the University of Nairobi says that for them to succeed in their research, female participants in Aids vaccine trials must agree to use effective contraceptives.\nThe period within which they must stay pregnancy-free is specified as the effects of the vaccine on the unborn child are not known.\nThe Kenya Aids Vaccine Initiative (Kavi) researchers tell of one study where 39 participants were enrolled for trials.\nThe women received family planning counselling and were offered a choice of contraceptive methods at no cost. But four women conceived during the study. \n\u201cAll four had opted for abstinence, but said they were coerced by their partners into unprotected sex,\u201d says the study.\nThe researchers say that sexual abstinence should no longer be an option. \nExplaining why abstinence has been an option, Kavi programme director Omu Anzala says at the early stages of the study, they select women with the lowest or zero risk of contracting HIV.\n\u201cAt Phase I of the trials, we are testing mainly two things \u2014 the vaccine\u2019s safety and whether it elicits any immune response and therefore need participants at very low risk of HIV infection,\u201d Prof Anzala said in an interview on Tuesday.\nMonitor the baby\nIf a participant conceives during the study period, vaccinations are stopped, compromising data from the trials. \n\u201cHowever, the woman is followed up and her pregnancy monitored. After the child is born, we monitor the baby for any possible ill effects,\u201d Prof Anzala said.\n\u201cThis development further erodes the already diminished contribution of female participation in Aids vaccine clinical trials. Every effort must therefore be made to ensure that participants in such trials do not get pregnant during the specified period and that they are retained to the trial\u2019s conclusion,\u201d says the study."}
