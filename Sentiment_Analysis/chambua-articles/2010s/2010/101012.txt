{"text": "October 12,\u00a02010\nWhat are you doing with your pain? \nBy ASUNTA WAGURA\nIf someone had told me in 1989 that I would be savouring the wondrous blessings that I am enjoying now, I would have sworn that they were mad and had been sent to torment me. \nAnd it\u2019s not that back then, I did not have hopes and dreams. It\u2019s just that the circumstances and my situation dictated that I take it one day at time. \u2028I\u2019m often asked by many after a lecture on HIV/AIDS how I managed to beat all the high tides to climb high in the spectrum of life. \nI moved from a single rental room in Eastlands, Nairobi which I shared with my kids, brother and sisters, to the suburbs. This is not an extraordinary success, but I came to learn that with humility, hard work and expectation, life changes. \nI have determined that any answer to this question might run the risk of forgetting the years of hard unrecognised and unseen work. This answer must go beyond a one hour talk. \nI once heard televangelist T.D. Jakes preaching about how some people want part of his anointing, not knowing that, for him, being called came with homelessness, an empty church, debt and rejection. \nYou can say the same thing about me. The fruits and flowers may seem cute, but you don\u2019t know about the ugly things \u2013 the weeds, and drought, and rot \u2013 that happened to the seed God planted. \nI have learnt that success is a combination of various factors. Success is not destination but a process, a journey, and I\u2019m still on this journey.\u2028I now believe that everything is a setup. \nI still remember when my landlady evicted me from my house. I thought my life had come to an end. Here I was, a single mother of one, and stigma and discrimination was so rampant, that I couldn\u2019t make a single move without glancing around furtively. \nThese factors vary from person to person. Some are born with a silver spoon in their mouth others a wooden one, but at the end of the day, success is a struggle and a journey\u00a0with no full stop. \nA lot of people have inspired me. I get tons of inspiration from the likes of Nelson Mandela, Wangari Mathaai, Ngugi Wa Thiongo, Mother Teresa and Mary Fisher, among others. I have a cabinet with thousands of books, because I live by the adage, readers are leaders. \nIn my work, reading about Mother Teresa gives me an inspiring and life-changing discovery of God\u2019s answer to cries of the human heart. \nAnd don\u2019t mistake me. I\u2019m not anything near Mother Teresa, and I never will be, but she has taught me about service and humility.\nWhen I read about Nelson Mandela and Wangari Mathaai I understand how struggle and persistence pays. \nReading about Ngugi Wa Thiongo opens to me how to be tolerant in the face of intolerance, while Mary Fisher, who\u2019s one of my mentors, has taught me how to live life to the full, not go through the motions, even though I\u2019m HIV positive. \nSome people make the toughest of tasks appear simple. Watching TV as rally drivers spin the wheels on rough and meandering thin roads with such a seemingly easy manner amazes me. \nWhen I get on the road in my car I can\u2019t even dream of trying the manoeuvres they make. \nA skilled choirmaster can make us believe anyone can hit the high notes, or a guy like Roger Federer makes lawn tennis to look easy, until we take a racket and hit the court. \nPerhaps that is why I have such a high admiration for people who are extraordinary for they make me aim higher if not being like them. \nA personal attempt only increases our admiration for the one who does what we can only dream of doing and this can lead us to boost our morale in things we are good at and sometimes not so good at. \u00a0\nIt\u2019s easy to feel short-changed when we look at the cards that life has dealt us in comparison to, say, the serostatus of other people. For some people who are living with HIV, being negative is the only thing that can make them live again. \nBut it\u2019s not my pain that makes or breaks me; it\u2019s what I do with this pain, it\u2019s what I make out of it. \nMy court is the informal settlements, and my ball serving hope and love to others. \nI may make it look easy, but that\u2019s because this is what I was called to do.\nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother of three who tested HIV-positive 23 years ago. She is the executive director of the Kenya Network of Women with Aids (KENWA).\nMost Popular\n\uf0b7  1 News Baby smashed to death on floor \n\uf0b7  2 Showbiz Eric Omondi pulls prank on fans with Lupita look-alike \n\uf0b7  3 Eldoret Moi Girls principal charged with abuse of office - VIDEO \n\uf0b7  4 News 7 days to road crisis - VIDEO \n\uf0b7  5 News House clears new matatu rules \n\uf0b7  6 Africa Kenya orders all refugees into designated camps \n\uf0b7  7 Politics MPs bar Cabinet Secretaries from flying flags - VIDEO \n\uf0b7  8 Living Why did you try to kill us?
