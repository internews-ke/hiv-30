{"text": "January 20,\u00a02010\nKenya may buy Ugandan ARVs \nBy WALTER MENYA and VPPS \nKenyans could soon access affordable anti-retroviral drugs made in Uganda. And Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has invited Kenya to buy shares in a company \u2014 the only one in Africa \u2014 that manufactures the drugs that control the effects of HIV.\nUganda opened Quality Chemicals, a joint venture with Indian drug maker Cipla, last year. President Museveni extended the invitation to Kenya, which has been suffering from high HIV/Aids prevalence in recent years.\nVice-President Kalonzo Musyoka on Monday visited the plant and praised the technology transfer taking place at the complex. He said he would advise the relevant health authorities back home to consider sourcing ARVs from the firm.\nThe plant that was established at a cost of Sh4 billion, produces 100 million tablets of ARVs, mainly the Duovir-n brand, every month. It also produces the anti-malarial drug Lumatern. \nUganda\u2019s Health minister Richard Nduhura said his country took the decision to manufacture generic ARVs after India, the traditional makers of generic drugs, ratified the Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights Accord under the World Trade Organisation.\nMr Nduhura said that what Africa needed now was to produce its own low-cost medicines, which were safe and effective, without relying on outside help.\nAnd in a meeting with members of the Ugandan business community, Mr Musyoka heard the challenges the traders faced in doing business with Kenya.\nThe Uganda Manufacturers Association cited inordinate delays in the clearing of their goods at the port of Mombasa and damages to goods during handling and transportation. The association also asked the Kenyan government to expedite compensation for goods lost during the 2007 post-election violence.\nLater in a meeting the management of Rift Valley Railways, led by chairman Brown Ondego, Mr Musyoka expressed concern that at a time when the world was embracing high speed rail transport, East Africa was still saddled with a dilapidated system.
