{"text": "KENYA: Plan to Fight Mother-to-Child AIDS Infection\nMike Mwaniki\n\n\nKenya is one of the nations targeted by the Campaign to End Pediatric HIV and AIDS (CEPA), launched last October with a goal of providing prevention and treatment services to 80 percent of HIV-positive pregnant women in six African countries. Currently, mother-to-child coverage is 30-40 percent, according CEPA, which is a three-year initiative.\nEach year on average, about 102,000 HIV-positive women deliver babies in Kenya, Dr. Irene Inwani, a pediatrician, said during a local CEPA launch ceremony. About 40,000 infants are infected annually, Inwani said. Kenya is among the top 20 nations that lack adequate antiretroviral (ARV) coverage for preventing mother-to-child transmission, experts say.\nKenya's government currently provides ARVs to about 30,002 infected children but another 60,000 remain in need, said Dr. Ibrahim Mohammed, director of the National AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Infections Program.\nThe government should allocate funding for pediatric ARVs and avoid being too dependent on foreign donors, said James Kamau, coordinator of Kenya Treatment Access Movement. Pediatric ARVs are now accessed through the Clinton Foundation. As a signatory to the 2000 Abuja Declaration, Kenya pledged to allocate 15 percent of its budget to health but has failed to do so, Kamau said."}
