{"text": "April 22,\u00a02010\nAids funds not being used well\nThe recent media report of Kenya being poised to lose 2.7 billion meant for the anti-Aids campaign due to delayed reporting by a local NGO shows the insensitivity and callousness on the part of people and organisations supposed to save Kenyans from suffering and death.\nIn the last six months, many Aids-intervention projects implemented by NGOS have collapsed, leaving widows and orphans in untold suffering.\nSuch unfortunate Kenyans are left without care and support provided by the projects.\nHundreds of people living with HIV have been left without antiretroviral drugs, exposing them to new infections and possible premature death as a result of the withdrawn medical care.\nGlobal Fund\u2019s aim has been to scale up interventions as well as reduce suffering and death caused by Aids. But in Kenya, it has been the source of confusion, frustration and disappointment. \nKey government officials have vested interest in the fund, and the little money made available to communities often causes more harm than good. Kenya has lost seven rounds of the fund due to self-interest among parties keen only in enriching themselves. \nThe current stalemate is rooted in delayed funds for over 50 community projects. As a result of the delayed funds, many orphans have been thrown out of school and hundreds of patients are almost giving up any hopes of survival. \nWhile Global Fund has done its part and now blames Kenya for delays in reporting and requesting the over Sh2 billion still lying in Geneva, the affected Kenyans\u2019 continued suffering is evidence of a callous attitude on the part of the people managing the funds. \nBut while it is not lost on the public that the National Aids Control Council and the concerned government ministries have paid for extensive media campaigns to project the images of \u201ccleaned-up houses\u201d, it is common knowledge that sharks remain in the same positions with an increased appetite and sophisticated looting methods. \nOne of the ways the sharks loot the funds is the financing of community-based organisations registered for the purpose. \nIt is about time Kenya stopped depending on donor money and started managing the disease with home-made funds.\nCONCERNED CITIZEN, \u2028Meru"}
