{"text": "April 20,\u00a02010\nFinally, I found a church that took me in just the way I am \nBy ASUNTA WAGURU\nTwo questions that I almost always have to answer are whether I\u2019m saved, and which church I go to. While I have no problem answering these questions, my concern is, are these the only prerequisites for spiritual satisfaction? I believe it requires more.\nWhen I tested HIV-positive and was given a six months to live, my hopes of the church coming to my rescue were crushed by the man of God.\n\u201cShe deserves no pity,\u201d he thundered. \u201cIt\u2019s written that the wages of sin is death, and that\u2019s it.\u201d\nWhen I didn\u2019t die like everyone had prophesied, I decided to give church another try. But this time I had a different reason.\n\u201cWhere I go after I die is immaterial,\u201d I reasoned. \u201cAll I need is a well-attended funeral, which will be presided by a pastor. Or is that not the tradition whether you were a saint or not?\u201d\nBut my plan unravelled. I made the mistake of confiding in one of the women ushers at the church where I worshipped because she seemed friendly, very \u201csaved\u201d, understanding and motherly: I told her I was HIV-infected. Unknown to me, she told the pastor.\nThe following Sunday, when it was time for announcements, the pastor said he had an announcement to make. Normally, someone else did this before giving the floor to the man of God to minister.\n\u201cMy church, which I founded under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, will not be used by the devil,\u201d the pastor said. \u201cMy church will not accommodate the works of the devil.\u201d\nThen he called me by name to go in front, but not anywhere near the altar.\n\u201cWhat you see here is nothing but the work of the devil, which I will destroy today, right before your eyes,\u201d he said, as my son, Peter, stood miserably beside me.\nThe pastor then ordered us out of the church and told us never ever to come anywhere near it. We walked home to our four cold walls, which seemed an eternity away. With that, I vowed it was over between God and me, and between the church and me. \nThat cruel public rejection reminded me how terrible it was to be infected with this virus, which made even the church, usually a place of solace, reject me.\n\u201cI\u2019ll also reject the church, the hypocritical churchgoers and anything to do with God,\u201d I swore.\nAnd that\u2019s how, for more than eight years, I sought solace in the only friend who couldn\u2019t reject me \u2013 liquor.\nIt was only later that I felt that what I needed to do was get a \u201cquiet\u201d church. I would attend quietly and say nothing about my HIV status. I didn\u2019t want any drama. \nI felt I couldn\u2019t continue going down the liquor road. At least I needed God, if not the churchgoers. I needed to restore my relationship with God.\nI found a church, but I made sure I sat at the back. But it wasn\u2019t long before the church recognised me and wanted to involve me in more than just coming and listening. But the prosperity gospel was too much for me. \nThe pastor here kept reminding us how we would be punished if we didn\u2019t give generously. His emphasis was on \u201cpaying premiums\u201d for the afterlife, not how to tackle my daily challenges. And that\u2019s why I quit going to church again.\nI took quite some time and \u201ctried\u201d a few churches before settling for the one I currently attend. I think my church-hopping days are over. \nMy pastor talks about how one can live here, how to cope with stress and face today\u2019s challenges. He gives me life skills, which I call weekly refuelling.\nIt\u2019s not really a church since we don\u2019t even have a building, but I feel very much at home here. People accept me the way I am, not because of who I am.\nIt\u2019s amazing that I look forward to Sundays. Previously, I would drag myself to church. It was religiosity, not a relationship. \nThe other Sunday I was thinking that if the pastor started charging an entry fee, I\u2019d book my ticket in advance. I\u2019ve found the crucial missing chunk, something that fulfils my life immeasurably. \nAnd, while I\u2019m waiting for the \u201cBig One\u201d, my pastor teaches how I should relate with God, and have His kingdom right here right now because, virus or no virus, the heavenly bliss must start here with the girl in the mirror.\nasuntawagura@hotmail.com"}
