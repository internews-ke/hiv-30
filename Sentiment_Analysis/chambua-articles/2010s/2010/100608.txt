{"text": "June 8,\u00a02010\nI\u2019m haunted by the eyes of a six-year-old orphan \nBy ASUNTA WAGURA\nNot too long ago, I went to visit an organisation implementing HIV-related community programmes in Western Kenya. I insisted on going since I\u2019m usually excluded from such exchange visits. But no sooner had I arrived than my excitement vanished and I wanted to return home. \nOn second thought, I didn\u2019t even know why I had insisted on making the trip. Then, on the day before we returned to Nairobi, we visited what were referred to as the programme\u2019s case studies. \nThere were several, but one case of a child-headed house gripped my conscience. That\u2019s when I had an epiphany and knew exactly why God had sent me there. \nAs we approached the home \u2013 parking our four-wheeler not too far away \u2013 one could feel the desolation of the place. A six year-old girl called Sheila was the focus. She doesn\u2019t go to school.\nSheila was dressed in an oversized clean new dress, which she\u2019d obviously been given to wear for our visit. It hung loosely on her small, emaciated body. No wonder she walked as if it would fall off any minute.\nShe gave me one look as I was the new guest being introduced around and her piercing eyes have haunted me to date. It\u2019s as if she was asking me why I had allowed this to happen to her. \nSheila\u2019s story is pathetic and a shame to all of us in HIV work. Her parents died in quick succession of Aids-related sicknesses \u2014 and the community, including relatives, left her to face her fate. \n\u201cThe community said the parents\u2019 death wasn\u2019t Aids-related but a curse,\u201d our guide informed us, adding that they refused to take Sheila and her nine year-old brother in because the curse would follow and kill whoever took the two in.\nLooking at the vast emptiness surrounding her, I was reminded of my own childhood. How I hated it when my mother when she went for overnight visits, and how I anxiously looked forward to her return, which looked like it took forever. \nSheila\u2019s waiting too, but in vain. Or, at least, waiting for this community to wake up to the fact that what they\u2019re doing is not right. \nSheila and her brother live in a a cold, empty house. And the coldnesstells you that these kids haven\u2019t cooked for a long time. \nThe relatives had a problem with the children\u2019s supposed curse, but they had no problem helping themselves to what Sheila\u2019s parents left behind. So the house was empty, save for some rags in a corner that served as a bed for those two poor kids. \nOn my way back, I promised to do something. I phoned our community health workers and they agreed to help me look for a children\u2019s home, telling me this must go through the Children\u2019s Department. \nWhen I arrived in Nairobi, I phoned the home to find the progress. And that\u2019s where I got the first shocker. \n\u201cWe\u2019re willing to take them, at a fee of Sh29,000 per child per term,\u201d the person on the other end told me. \n\u201cWhat?\u201d I protested. \u201cBut you\u2019re a children\u2019s home ... you are a charitable organisation, aren\u2019t you?\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s either Sh29,000 or nothing.\u201d\nI hung up, exasperated. But worse was still to come. When I called the Children\u2019s Department for assistance so that I could be allowed to take the children, the children\u2019s officer\u2019s reply shocked me beyond words. \n\u201cDo you understand our traditions?\u201d the woman lectured me. \u201cYou cannot take those children because our traditions do not allow it.\u201d\n\u201cI would want to respect your traditions,\u201d I tried to be polite, although I could feel my anger rising, \u201cbut not when they are enslaving and dehumanising those two innocent kids.\u201d \nI\u2019m not sure she heard my last words because she hung up. I tried calling again so I would be allowed to bring those children over to our home, but I\u2019ve been hitting my head against a brick wall.\nThe last time I called, I was given that tired bureaucratic excuse: \u201cCall after two weeks ... Madam is on leave.\u201d\nI\u2019m still trying to see how I can assist. I won\u2019t not give up because Sheila\u2019s eyes keep indicting me. I cannot answer her until I exhaust all the options available. But the sixty-four thousand dollar question is, why are some people so insensitive towards children? \nasuntawagura@hotmail.com\nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother of two who tested positive 23 years ago.
