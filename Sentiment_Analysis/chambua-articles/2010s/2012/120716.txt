{"text": "July 16,\u00a02012\nImmorality spreading Aids among pupils\nTutors discriminating against HIV-positive pupils got a stern warning from the Ministry of Education last week. But the problem goes further than just discrimination.\nSexual abuse is prevalent among teenage girls, particularly pupils. This is the primary cause of the spread of Aids in the first place.\nInfected teachers are exploiting the innocence of pupils, luring them to sexual relationships, with promises of money. Often, the pupils are forced to have sex. \nThe girls in turn engage in unprotected sex with teenage boys, at times, several of them. \nThis immorality is spreading HIV like bush fire. Unless something is done soon, there will be a HIV crisis in schools.\nPreventing those infected from intentionally or recklessly spreading the virus should be the primary concern of ministries of health and education officials. \nThere are those who harbour the disease without showing symptoms of the illness, and infect others unknowingly. \nAt the same time, there are those who know they are carriers, but deliberately spread the virus.\nA former primary school teacher, aged 65, and a known carrier, was recently found in the bush in my village with a 13-year-old girl. \nThe girl confessed this was the third time. Medical examination showed the girl was infected with HIV. There are many other girls who have been infected by the same man.\nIt\u2019s time people like these are punished by law. Parliament should pass stiffer penalties for such crimes."}
