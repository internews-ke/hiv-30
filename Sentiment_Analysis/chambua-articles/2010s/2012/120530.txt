{"text": "30 April 2012 \nStealing money meant for the sick too callous\nBecause of reading of too many corruption cases, Kenyans may not be surprised by yet another audit which details how money meant to fight HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis has been misappropriated for years.\nThe audit tells of how money from the Global Fund has been consistently looted since 2003, with no efforts being made to safeguard one of the few resources targeted mainly at the poor.\nThe Global Fund has arguably been the most instrumental institution in reducing pain from the three diseases in Kenya. However, due to corruption in Kenya and a few other recipient countries, the Fund is threatened with collapse.\nLast year, reports of corruption within its programmes including here in Kenya, made some donor countries withhold funding pledges, greatly undermining the Fund\u2019s capacity to deliver.\nAny new corruption reports in its programmes can only complicate its current reform agenda .\nHence it is possible to understand the Fund\u2019s frustration with dealing with the belligerency being shown by programme implementers in Kenya. The Fund is fighting against attracting too much negative publicity internationally and yet not be seen to be covering up corruption.\nThis may explain why, even with this new evidence of corruption in Kenya, the Fund opts for a non-confrontational approach preferring to plead with the thieves to return the loot.\nWhile we may understand the Fund\u2019s predicament, it is incomprehensible why the government cannot act against the saboteurs. \nIt is inconceivable that the same institutions which allowed the looting are now expected to oversee what is a very generous refund programme. This may the highest degree of impunity.\n- See more at: http://www.kenyacentral.com/general/28823-stealing-money-meant-for-the-sick-too-callous.html#sthash.VZCjO022.dpuf"}
