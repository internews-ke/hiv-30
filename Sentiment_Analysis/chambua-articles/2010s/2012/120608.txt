{"text": "MISSED CHANCE I Grant could have saved more than 20,000 lives\nGlobal Fund denies Kenya Sh5bn\nMoney allocated to Kenya to\nfight Aids, TB and malaria diverted\nto other countries due to fraud\n\n\nBY GATONYE GATHURA\ngathura@ke.nationmedia.com\nKenya has missed more than 8hS.7 billion ($67 million) for fighting Aids, malaria and TB because of fraud and mismanagement of Global Fund's money.\nThe funds that had been allocated to Kenya have been diverted to other countries, which have a better track record, according to Bernard Rivers, the executive director of Aidspan \u2013 a watchdog of the Global Fund programmes.\nThe money, Mr Rivers says, could have saved more than 20,000 lives. HIV is responsible\nfor almost three out of every 10 deaths in Kenya.\nIn an article posted on the Global Fund Observer on Monday,\nMr Rivers blames both local implementing agencies as well as the Global Fund for letting the mess go unabated for long.\n''I was stunned to find that $67 million was never disbursed by the Global Fund. Yes: $67 million that was available for Kenya was never sent; it was eventually made use of by the Fund for grants to other countries:\u201d says Mr Rivers.\nBut the director had only studied three grants out of a probable\n14, indicating the amount Kenya has missed may be many times over what is reported in the\nGlobal Fund Observer.  Responding to the article, Mr Seth Faison, the communications\ndirector of the Global\nFund, agrees that there have been challenges but strongly\ndefends Kenya's performance in fighting the three diseases, which he describes as commendable.\nContacted by the Observer to comment on the article before it was published, Dr Peter Cherntich, the coordinator of a key component of the Global Fund mechanism in Kenya, said in recent past, the country had\ntaken significant steps to ensure that resources were used appropriately.\nAccording to an audit report released in April, Kenya is\nsupposed to refund $3  million (Sh'70 million), whose expenditure was not supported by sufficient documentary evidence or was stolen, to the Global Fund.\nA section in the audit report explaining how far Kenya had gone in implementing the recommendations says some individuals, especially in the Division of Malaria Control, had already returned some of\nthe money they had stolen. In one instance, the government\nsays it has recovered the bulk of  8h4.S million withdrawn from a Global Fund grant using\nfake documents, with the staff in question having been asked to refund 8h2.5 million.\nI"}
