Since then several achievements have been\nmade in the fight against HIV and AIDS.\nThe epidemic has stabilized with the prevalence rate having gone down from 14% (1990s) to 6.3% in 2009.\nHIV related deaths have reduced from 102,794 in 2000 to 57,000 in 2011. However, new infections still\nremain high, estimated at 104,000 annually. HIV and AIDS remains a major public health concern in Kenya.\nSimilarly, the proportion of the HIV positive population accessing ARVs has increased to more than 540,000\npeople currently on treatment. Nonetheless, there still exist continuing and emerging challenges that need\nto be addressed for the country to achieve its national goals as articulated in KNASP III and go beyond the\nuniversal access targets of 2010. These challenges include: High new infection rates, low condom use at\nhigh risk sex, gaps in scientific evidence (research) to inform HIV programming. The cornerstone of KNASP\nIII implementation hinges on evidence based programming. Thus, the 2nd Biennial HIV and AIDS conference\nprovides a platform for dialogue among diverse stakeholders.\nTarget audience; Individuals (Decision makers, Researchers, Policy Makers, Opinion leaders, Members\nof Parliament, Beneficiaries), Institutions (Universities, Research Institutions, GoK- Line Ministries),\nOrganizations (Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), Faith Based Organizations, Development partner\norganizations, Private sector organizations, Philanthropic organizations).\nABSTRACTS ARE INVITED FOR SUBMISSION IN THE FOLLOWING AREAS (sub-themes)\nA.-Service Delivery\nA1 HIV Prevention.\nUnder this theme we are looking for papers that address Mother to Child Transmission (MTCT),\nVoluntary Medical Male Circumcision (VMMC), Treatment as prevention, Behaviour Change\nCommunication (BCC), Prevention with Positives (PwP) and Innovations and technologies.\nA2 Treatment and Care.\nUnder this theme we are looking for papers that address the elite infected with HIV; innovations in\nHIV treatment; adherence to care and treatment; nutrition; complementary, alternative medicine and\nopportunistic infections.\nA3 Health Systems\nUnder this theme we are looking for papers that address health system under devolved government;\nE-medicine and E-health; integration of health systems; referral systems; capacity building; quality\nassurance and commodities and logistics management.\nA4: Home and Community Based Care and Support.\nB- Sectoral Mainstreaming\nUnder this theme we are looking for papers that address financing; global health initiatives; public and\nprivate partnerships; HIV and AIDS at the workplace; HIV and People with Disability(PwD).\nC-Community Based Programmes\nUnder this theme we are looking for papers that address role of community in HIV prevention, care, treatment\nand support; sustainability of community HIV and AIDS programmes; gender based violence; child sexual\nabuse and exploitation and stigma and discrimination.\nD-Governance, Leadership and Strategic Information\nUnder this theme we are looking for papers that address Policy, legislation and regulatory framework; Role\nof research in future HIV programming; Coordination and Collaboration; HMIS, HIV Surveillance, Monitoring\nand Evaluation; Sustainable financing and country ownership of HIV programmes and the Role of Media in\nHIV programming.\nREGISTRATION FEES (Excludes Accommodation and transport to conference venue)\nDelegate Category Registration Rates USD $ KSH\nLocal USD 120 10, 000\nEast African Region USD 150 12, 750\nPLWHIV USD 50 4, 250\nStudents USD 50 4, 250\nOther Regions USD200 17,000\nExhibition\n1Standard Exhibition Space 3x3 sqm USD 250 per day 21, 250\n2Double standard Exhibition Space 6x3 sqm USD 400 per day 34, 000\nImportant dates\nDeadline for Submission/Exhibition: February 28, 2013\nNotification for Abstract/Exhibition : March 31,2013\nRegistration deadline: March15,2013\nPay to: Account Name: National AIDS Control Council: CitiBank N.A Upper Hill, Nairobi A/C No.\n0400729018 or MPESA PayBill Number: 590100 (use your online registration number as the Mpesa\naccount number)\nCorrespondence\nThe Conference Secretariat\nNational AIDS Control Council\nP.O.
