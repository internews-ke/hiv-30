{"text": "April 17,\u00a02012\nMPs urged to speed up Aids agency Bill \nBy NATION CORRESPONDENT\nParliament has been asked to give the National Aids Commission Bill priority to help fight the disease.\u2028At the same time the National Aids Control Council (NACC), established in 1999, has been faulted for having failed to combat the spread of HIV/Aids.\u2028\u201cThe NACC was formed without giving it power to implement its mandate rendering it toothless in enforcing accountability under the monitoring and evaluation framework,\u201d said National Council of NGOs chairman Ken Wafula.\u2028He asked MPs to hasten the passing of the Bill, noting that HIV/Aids remained a national calamity.\u2028Specific legislation\u2028\u201cThere is a need to have accurate data on programmes in terms of coverage and funding since the current legal structure has no provision for devolved system of government that will operate at the county level,\u201d he said.\u2028The NGOs council chairman asked the government to borrow a leaf from countries such as Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda that had specific legislation addressing the management and control of HIV/Aids.\u2028\u201cThe NACC should be transformed into a commission so that multi-sectoral nature of HIV/Aids programming is maintained given that the number of ministries under the new Constitution is to be reduced to a maximum of 22 and the council could fall under a ministry which could make its mandate difficult to implement,\u201d Mr Wafula noted.\nHe appealed to Parliament to pass the National Aids Commission Bill 2012 before the next General Election to make it effective."}
