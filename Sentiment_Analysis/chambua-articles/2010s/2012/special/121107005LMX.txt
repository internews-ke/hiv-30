{"text": "THERE\u2019S A LOT OF INJUSTICE IN THIS WORLD\n\nI have taken many\nmercies for granted\nIt\u2019s Friday. Tomorrow I\u2019ll receive an award from the Voice of Hope organisation.\nAs we rehearse, I look at my fellow awardees and wonder what they were nominated\nfor.\nMy train of thought is interrupted by a melody. In the four days I\u2019ve been here, I\u2019ve\nlearnt that the melody goes off after every hour. When this happens, everyone must\nobserve a moment of silence. Meaning you press the \u201cpause button\u201d on what you\u2019re\ndoing (or thinking) and simply reflect on your inner self. I think it\u2019s called meditation.\nAs the place sinks into a deep silence, I don\u2019t reflect on myself. I\u2019m thinking about\nwhat everyone else thinking. Are their thoughts wandering too?\nThe minute is over and the melody is gone. Well, at times it\u2019s spiritually beneficial\nto reflect on the self.\nIt\u2019s raining heavily. We\u2019ve been told that people can take silent walks to meditate.\nI\u2019m very cautious of the weather, especially when it comes to exposing myself to the\nrain. These are some of the unwritten rules for people living with HIV. Never expose\nyourself to rain, cold or dust. Never ever. You may survive, but you don\u2019t want to\ndeal with the consequences of disobeying HIV\u2019s unwritten rules.\nThere\u2019s another reason why I\u2019ve never taken walks in the compound since I arrived.\nThe person\nwho received us\nsaid it was safe to\nwalk around, although\none may occasionally\nencounter\na bear.\n\u201cIf you encounter\na bear, don\u2019t panic.\nGo on your way\ncalmly and don\u2019t\nshow your fear.\nBears are friendly\nanimals and unless\nprovoked, they don\u2019t\nattack humans.\u201d\nThe last thing I\nwant to deal with\nis a bear. Its docility\nis not for Asunta to\nprove.\nSaturday evening.\nWe\u2019re all set for the\nawards. I\u2019m the first\non the podium. My,\nI\u2019m being feted in\nthe world\u2019s numero\nuno city: New York.\nI feel humbled. There are two people I wish could have been here to witness this.\nOne is my father. I know he would have stood with me after I tested HIV-positive. I\nknow. And he would have been proud of me today.\nThe other person is the principal who disclosed my HIV status in the most inhuman\nway ever. I wish she was here to witness how God rewrote her tragic script.\nI start my presentation by showing a person being given home-based care. He\ncan barely walk without the assistance of a community volunteer worker. There\u2019s\nprogress. The person is now mentoring others in a group therapy. Besides, he is\nrearing dairy goats that provide his family with milk.\nThe other awardees share their stories. Stories of pain. One from Afghanistan\nhas been struggling to make the situation of the common man known, as stronger\nnations struggle. He has been arrested and kidnapped to stop him from telling the\nworld the story of war in Afghanistan.\nHe shows where he works in cafes without water, electricity or basic necessities.\nHe walks for miles in the scorching sun to have his stories published. And he has to\ndo it pretty quickly because if his foes get him, all his work will be destroyed.\nIt is eye-opening that some people live in fear and the devastation of war,\nwhereas in Kenya I take so much for granted. I can hear quiet sobs as I restrain my\ntears, seeing pictures of massacred children and women. I make a mental note: this\nis a lesson to take home, especially now that we\u2019re going into a General Election.\nNext is a lady from Chile. She shares how she uses her skills to bring justice to\nthe society. In her investigative journalism, she seeks employment in government\noffices where she exposes corruption. She does the same in hospitals where the\nmedical staff have no regard for human life and in the police force where bribery is\nrampant. She resigned several times because she said she only witnessed pain and\nno justice. Later, she reconsidered this decision and went back, saying, \u201cThe little I\ncan do is let the world know there\u2019s injustice in the world.\u201d\nI return home the following day reasoning that my situation isn\u2019t as bad as those\nof the other awardees. I\u2019m grateful that God has placed me in a far better place to\nserve humanity.\nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother-of-three who tested HIV-positive\n23 years ago. She is the executive director of the Kenya Network"}
