The residents of Nairobi and\nKilifi also said that the drug\u2019s acceptance as a tool in the fight against HIV was high but those who take alcohol did not swallow the pill daily as advised.\nThe Kenyans were part of an international study that sought ways of improving Truvada, a pill that prevents HIV.\nIn a study published last month (19th October) in the\nAids and Behaviour Journal and carried out by among others,\nKenya Medical Research Institute, alcohol use was identified as a reason for not taking the pills on time or not taking them altogether.\nThe study on the drug Truvada, which is already registered in the country for use as an antiretroviral, also\nfound the pill to have other positive side effects. Some\nstudy participants said the it increased their eating and sexual appetites.\n\u201cIt helped me because there\nwere times I didn\u2019t have any\nappetite but when I started\ntaking the pill, I now eat a\nlot,\u201d the study quotes a participant.\nParticipants especially\nthose on the daily regimen are\nreported to have experienced\nincreased libido.\nThe researchers were testing\ntwo different dosage schedules;\none involving taking\nof the Truvada pill daily and\nanother where one took the\npill two times a week.\nThe use of antiretroviral\ndrugs to prevent HIV infection\notherwise known as\nPre-exposure prophylaxis\n(PrEP) is one of the latest\nstrategies to reduce the risk\nof infection and has already\nbeen approved by the World\nHealth Organisation.\nThe Kenya study involved\n72 HIV negative volunteers;\n31 were men who have sex\nwith men (MSM) and five female\nprostitutes from Mtwapa,\nKilifi, while 36 were MSM from\nNairobi with an average age of\n26 years.\nFor the pill to be more\nacceptable, the participants\nsaid its size, shape, colour,\nand taste, all of which affected\ncomfort and ease of use, needs\nto be improved."}
