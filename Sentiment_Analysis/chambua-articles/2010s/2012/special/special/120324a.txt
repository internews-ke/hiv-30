{"text": "March 23,\u00a02012\nFamilies grapple with dark secret \n\nBy ARTHUR OKWEMBA\nThe private struggles of a small but anonymous group of Kenyan parents of adolescent children have come to light in yet another twist to the decades-old battle against HIV.\nWhile the challenges of parenting adolescent children are well known, a number of parents and doctors who opened up in recent days spoke of the far more complex matter of informing the children that they have been HIV-positive since birth \u2014 casting a shadow on future love and relationships.\nHIV-positive parents said they had delayed this information to protect their children\u2019s innocence. \nBut with the reality of teen sex fast approaching, they were forced to face the hard questions:\n\t\u2022\tWhat if my teenage child became sexually active before I tell them that they contracted the virus at birth?\n\t\u2022\tHow do I communicate that I am responsible for their status?\n\t\u2022\tHow do I explain the long silence?\n\t\u2022\tHow will my child react?\nIt is a struggle that Margaret, who works at a government hospital in Nairobi, knows well. \nLast year when her daughter Pat turned 16-years-old, she celebrated her birthday with a lot of apprehension. \nDuring the party, her daughter invited her boyfriend who was about 17-years-old.\nWhat frightened Margaret was not her daughter dating, but that she had not told the girl she was born HIV-positive.\nFor 16 years, she had guarded the secret of how the virus was passed to Pat from her and the father. \nMargaret says she had to pray for strength to break the news to the teenager.\n\u201cIt was not easy because I was trying to tell her that she has to take extra care than other young women of her age when it came to having relationships. I also had to find ways of explaining to her how she got the virus.\u201d \nEven though Margaret counsels HIV positive persons to live positively, this was the most difficult thing for her.\nAfter several visits to a professional counsellor, Margaret and the counsellor disclosed to Pat her status. \n\u201cWe started telling her of my status first and explained how I got infected. On the third visit, we disclosed to her that the virus was passed from us (mother and father) to her at birth.\u201d\nPat was distraught for two days before she fame to terms with her condition.\n\u201cSince then, she is very responsible especially with relationships. Most of the time we share a lot like sisters, and so far so good,\u201d says Margaret, smiling.\nShe suggests that parents with HIV positive children should be taught how to disclose to them their status.\nSexually active teenagers\nMargaret is not alone. When Simon\u2019s wife died four years ago from an HIV-related opportunistic infection, he struggled to ensure one person, their 15-year-old son, did not know the cause of death. \nSimon and his wife had kept the secret about the virus they passed to their son, Jared, at birth. The sickness and the death of his mother brought him close to establishing his HIV status. \nSo fearful was the couple about him knowing his status that when he fell sick, one of them took him to hospital to ensure they managed the information he got. \nTo stave off opportunistic infections, they kept him on immune boosters and a very good diet.\u00a0 So far, he has not started taking ARVs.\n\u201cHis CD4 count is good as well as the viral load level. My prayer is he does not slip from where he is now,\u201d says Simon, who has been on antiretroviral therapy for six years. \nSimon is now faced with another dilemma: his son has started developing a strong interest in girls.\n\u201cSo far I have managed very well. But the biggest problem I am experiencing now is to tell him that he is HIV-positive, and needs to abstain or have safe sex,\u201d says Simon. \nWhat worries him most is his son could be sexually active, and maybe having an intimate partner.\nThis means if Simon does not break the news soon, then he is going to unknowingly infect his partners or get infected with possibly another strain of the virus. \nDelicate assignment\nThe possibility of this happening is more real, if documented evidence is anything to go by. \nThe 2008/2009 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey found that 22 percent of young men are twice as likely to engage in sexual intercourse before the age 15 than young women. \nAnd by age 18, 47 per cent women and 58 per cent men have had sexual intercourse. Simon\u2019s son maybe one of those young men engaging in sex before or by the age 15. \nMore worrying, the study notes, many young Kenyans reported engaging in unprotected sex the first time they had sex. \nOf those interviewed, only 24 per cent women and 26 per cent men had used a condom when they had their first sexual encounter. \nThe Kenya Aids Indicator Survey 2007 found about 2.3 per cent of those infected with HIV were aged between 15 and 19 years, and 5.2 per cent were aged between 20 and 24 years.\nIt is this reality and context that is pushing Simon to find appropriate time and place to tell his son the truth. \n\u201cI do not want any other person to do it. Let the counsellor come into the picture after I have first talked to him,\u201d says Simon.\nHis biggest fear is Jared will hate him for not telling him about his condition if it is disclosed to him by someone else.\n\u201cHe needs to understand why we took this long to tell him.\u201d HIV experts warn that if the revelation is not done well, it can be devastating to the young person.\n\u201cThe first thing they see is their world has come to an end, and may even commit suicide. Such disclosure should therefore be handled very careful and in a gradual, calculated manner,\u201d says Surendra Patel, an adjunct professor at the University of Nairobi College of Biological and Physical Sciences.\nA doctor at a private hospital in Nairobi\u2019s Eastlands\u00a0said a Form Two boy went into shock and refused to speak to anyone for three months when he was told about his HIV status two years ago.\u00a0 \nHe disappeared from school and was found after five months. \u201cHe was an orphan and nobody had told him about what killed his parents.\n\u201cOnly to learn about his status when tests were done to establish the cause of an opportunistic infection he was suffering from,\u201d says the doctor.\u00a0 \nThese cases are just a tip of the iceberg of the difficult situation that other parents with children who were born with HIV are going through. Disclosing to the children is frightening. \n\u201cMajority of the parents postpone disclosing to the child when young because they are likely not to comprehend what they are being told. Hence parents wait for an appropriate age to disclose,\u201d says Prof Omu Anzala, head of the Kenya Aids Vaccine Initiative.\nProf Anzala adds that when the child has reached an appropriate age of 12 to 16 years, the parents faces another dilemma of explaining how he or she got infected. \n\u201cSome of these children have grown knowing that HIV is spread through sex. And here you are telling them they are HIV positive when they have never had sex. It is just a difficult area for parents,\u201d says Prof Anzala.\n\u00a0\u201cIt is even a bigger dilemma when the parent has to tell the child to start medication and take care when in intimate relationships.\u201d\nAt the MP Shah Hospital in Nairobi, a doctor has offered to help parents facing such a dilemma to disclose to their children their HIV status. \n\u201cWe are waiting for the April holidays to disclose to the two teenagers and chart the way forward, including speaking about relationships,\u201d says the doctor who cannot be named because of the sensitivity of the matter. \nHIV experts say parents feel guilty telling their children that they were infected by them. But the biggest question is how some of these children are able to survive without drugs for such a long time. \nResearchers say their bodies have learnt to coexist with the virus and they only fall sick when the immune system is weakened. \nProf Anzala, who is leading research on adults whose immune system is able to control HIV replication, says this may be explained by two factors that host or virus related. \nEither the child has certain genetic related factors such as human leukocyte antigen (HLA) which contains a large number of genes related to immune system. \nThe HLA play a critical role in immune defence, and a child with a good function of these genes has a better protection against diseases. \nThe other explanation is the child might be having a virus that does not replicate very fast. \nLike in adults some of the children, although at a lesser frequency, might also be elite controllers-persons with antibodies able to neutralise the virus.\nThat is why when on good nutrition and care, some children live with the virus into adolescence without a scare.\nMatters become complicated when they start experiencing changes that make them attracted to the opposite sex. \nThey want to fall in love and some start having sex, at times without protection.\nDr Patel, who was among the first doctors to handle HIV patients in the early 1980s, says these are some of the most difficult cases he has dealt with.\n\u201cThey want to live and enjoy life like fellow teenagers and you have to ensure they do it in a more responsible manner. This is the most difficult part,\u201d he says.\nFear of falling in love\nBut even those who know their HIV status are not finding it easier either. \n\u201cMy friends have female friends and they always wonder why I am not getting intimate. Little do they know that my HIV status is the cause,\u201d says 17-year-old Frank.\nFrank says he fears that no young woman would want to fall in love with him if he discloses he is HIV positive.\n\u201cI fear I will be deeply devastated if she rejects me. So I am avoiding falling in love.\u201d\nWhen he decides to fall in love, Frank has resolved it will be with a girl who is also HIV positive. \nLike Frank, other HIV positive young people are facing serious challenges especially when it comes to having relationships and starting a family.\nBut with advancement in technology, they are assured of getting HIV negative children and raising a family.\u00a0 \nSupport groups of young people living with HIV have also been formed to help them deal with these problems. \nIn these groups, young people are educated about the dangers of risky sexual behaviours and drug use. They are also sensitsed on relationships."}
