{"text": "Move quickly to stop\nabuse of HIV drugs\nReports that medicines for the management\nof HIV are being used in the brewing of illicit\nalcohol have been met with a loud silence, especially\nfrom regulatory authorities. Media reports\nin recent days have presented evidence that antiretrovirals\nare, indeed, being diverted from legitimate\nuse to the manufacture of illicit alcohol.\nThe brewers are sophisticated, packaging their\nwares to mimic popular brands in the market and\nselling them in legal establishments. The unscrupulous\nbrewers are also using chemicals such as\nthe preservative formalin. lt is not known how such\ncompounds would interact or affect the health of\nconsumers, but they definitely are not safe.\nlt is curious that neither of the ministries of\nHealth, the National Agency for the Campaign\nAgainst Drug Abuse, or even the Kenya Bureau\nof Standards (Kebs) have come out to warn the\npublic about the dangers of these products. Indeed,\nKebs and the Anti-Counterfeit Agency should have\nmoved fast to flush out these criminals and saboteurs\nof genuine business.\nAlthough the reports did not indicate the volume\nof the antiretrovirals involved and whether they\nare significant enough to sabotage HIV control\nprogrammes, the relevant civil groups should have\nweighed in to seal the loopholes. Non-governmental\ngroups may not welcome such negative reports\nsince they may discourage donors, but doing nothing\ncan only escalate the problem while criminals\nfind other ways of using the free HIV medicines.\nThis is a matter of protecting Kenyans' health\nand government agencies must act with the same\nzeal being demonstrated in the fight against counterfeit\nmobile phones to stop these activities. The\ncurrent Alcohol Control Act provides the muscle to\ndeter the criminals."}
