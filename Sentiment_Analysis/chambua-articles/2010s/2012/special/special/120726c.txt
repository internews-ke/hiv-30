{"text": "July 26,\u00a02012\nHope for Aids cure as drug flushes out virus \nScientists in the United States say they had used a cancer drug to flush out the Aids virus lurking dormant in trial patients\u2019 white blood cells \u2014 a tentative step towards a cure.\nThe ability of the HIV genome, or reproductive code, to hide in cells and be revived after decades poses a major obstacle in the quest for a cure.\nBeing able to expose the virus in its hiding place would allow scientists to target the host white blood cells in a killing blitz.\n\u201cIt is the beginning of work toward a cure for Aids,\u201d said David Margolis, co-author of the study published in the Journal Nature, as the International Aids Conference was under way in Washington.\nHIV is a retrovirus, inserting its DNA into the genome of host white blood cells, CD4+T cells in this case, and turning them into virus factories. Sometimes it goes into hiding in some cells even as others keep on producing. \nSome 34 million people around the world are living with HIV, which destroys the immune system and has caused about 30 million Aids-related deaths since the disease first emerged in the early 1980s.\nIn the latest study, researchers in the United States used the chemotherapy drug vorinostat to revive and so unmask latent HIV in the CD4+T cells of eight trial patients.\nThe patients were also on antiretroviral drugs, which stops HIV from multiplying but have to be taken for life because they do not kill the virus hidden away in reservoirs.\n\u201cAfter a single dose of the drug (vorinostat), at least for a moment in time, is flushing the virus out of hiding,\u201d Margolis said of the trial results \u2014 the first drug ever shown to do so.\n\u201cThis is proof of the concept, of the idea that the virus can be specifically targeted in a patient by a drug, and essentially opens up the way for this class of drugs to be studied for use in this way.\u201d\nThe drug targets an enzyme that allows the virus to lie latent. \nThe researchers cautioned that vorinostat may, however, have some toxic effects and stressed this was merely an early indication of feasibility that had to be explored further.\nExactly what would happen after the virus was unveiled in reservoir cells was also not certain, Margolis said.\n\u201cWe know that many cells that produce HIV die in the process. We know many cells that produce HIV can be identified and killed by the immune system. As far as we can tell, all the viruses floating around while patients are taking therapy don\u2019t get into cells because they are blocked by the therapy,\u201d he said.\nWithout a host cell, the virus would die within a few minutes.
