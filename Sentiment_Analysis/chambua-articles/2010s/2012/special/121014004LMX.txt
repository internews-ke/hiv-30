{"text": "Learning how the\nother half survives\nWhen I tested HIV-positive, I swore that this was the biggest issue in the world.\nBigger than world peace or the price of gas. All my energies were concentrated on\nmy nagging issue. I would have told you to go to hell if you had tried to tell me that\nthere were other pressing matters in the world.\nPart of this was due to the fact that HIV was perceived as a matter of life and\ndeath. The diagnosis turned one\u2019s life topsy-turvy. You woke up and went to bed\nagonising about it. What sent most folks to their early graves were stigma and discrimination;\nnot to mention lack of effective care and support systems.\nIt\u2019s no wonder that I ate, drank and slept HIV. When I started living positively, it\ntook me time to put this big enchilada on the back burner.\nIt\u2019s easy to see everything through the HIV prism because for the past two decades,\nmy daily job has singularly been in the HIV field. Over time, I have come to\nbe encouraged by the experiences of other women who are going through tough\ntimes. These are not people living with HIV (PLWHs) per se, but folks who are dealing\nwith other challenges.\nWe in the HIV trenches can become so preoccupied with advocacy that we tune\nout the voices of fighters in other trenches.\nWhen I went to London, this\nwas brought into sharp focus. I\nheard stories from near and far,\nand some made my experience\npale in comparison. I\u2019m reminded\nof Juliette\u2019s story.\n\u201cJuliette\u2019s passion for running\nstarted when she was a little girl\nand continued through high school\nand college. After being diagnosed\nwith cancer eight years ago, she\nvowed to be a living testament to\nfaith in God, the benefits of good\nmedical treatment and the power\nof a positive attitude. She also\ndecided that when she was strong\nenough to restart her workout\nregimen, she would participate in\nraces that support great causes.\nThree months after completing\nchemotherapy and 37 rounds of\nradiation, she participated in her\nfirst Susan Komen 5km race and\nhas been going ever since!\u201d\nThat was my \u201caha!\u201d moment.\nThe re-education of Asunta\nLike I said, most of my \u201ceducation\u201d\nhas been courtesy of the HIV virus and PLWHs. This is where I\u2019m supposed to serve\nhumanity. Still, I am being educated and given more life lessons by other people\nwho may seem to be outside the scope of my \u201csyllabus\u201d.\nThis reminds me of a programme I once watched on a local TV channel. They\nwere talking about things we used to champion years ago, like urging the media\nand general public to use appropriate language when referring to PLWHs.\nFor instance, we discourage the use of such demeaning terms as \u201csufferers\u201d or\n\u201cvictims\u201d. That\u2019s because we believe that PLWHs have the God-given ability to chart\ntheir own destinies. We like to say that this virus has only messed our immunity, not\nour humanity.\nIn the TV programme, they were talking about persons living with physical disabilities.\nThe panellists argued that some of these folks are made to feel like inanimate\nobjects. They gave the example of the word \u201cviziwi\u201d, which, with my limited\nknowledge of Kiswahili, I always believed was the plural for persons with hearing\ndisabilities.\n\u201cThe ngeli of ki-vi is for inanimate things like kisu-visu,\u201d the panellists argued, giving\nthe example of knife-knives.\nIt\u2019s something I always do without knowing. Like they say, the road to hell is\npaved with good intentions. I took something home, and nowadays I watch my\ntongue.\nKnowing how the other half survives is making me a better mother, sister, friend\nand PLWH. I now know that it\u2019s not just about HIV and how PLHWs are getting a\nraw deal.\nIf the world becomes a better place only for PLWHs, then it really isn\u2019t a better\nplace, is it? I cannot change the world, but I\u2019ll endeavour to change any patch I\ncome across. That\u2019s the least I can do. Because we\u2019re in this beautiful thing called life\ntogether.\nTHERE\u2019S MORE TO LIFE THAN OUR PERSONAL CHALLENGES\nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother-of-three who tested HIV-positive\n23 years ago.
