{"text": "MY CHILDREN MAKE ME THINK OUTSIDE THE HIV BOX\nJoshua is turning\nyet another page\nTHIS FRIDAY, MY second-born son, Joshua, will blow out six candles on his birthday\ncake. I believe everything happens for a purpose. God brought Joshua into my life\nat the right time and place.\nI don\u2019t take for granted the fact that I was able to give birth to a HIV-negative\nbaby. This was impossible back in the day when I was expecting my first son, Peter.\nI spent countless sleepless nights worrying myself sick about what would happen\nto him and people\u2019s negativity almost made me terminate that pregnancy. I knew\nnothing about mother-to-child transmission of HIV, so I\u2019m not stretching it when I\nsay that God singularly came through for me.\nWith Joshua, I had to worry; but not about mother-to-child transmission. The\nmarvels of science took care of this stress.\nI had to worry about conceiving. I had had miscarriages, and would have given\nmy fallopian tubes to carry a foetus to full term. Eventually, after waiting and almost\nrunning out of hope, God answered my petitions.\nWhen other women who are trying to conceive ask me about it, as if I\u2019m the expert,\nI don\u2019t know exactly what to say: I just say it\u2019s God.\nThat\u2019s why even as I celebrate Joshua\u2019s birthday, and the joys he brings to my life,\nI realise that I\u2019m fortunate. Many women who are living with HIV, and are dying to\nhave babies, can\u2019t celebrate such joys.\nI\u2019ve always said that my children give me a reason to live. I don\u2019t have time to\nworry about my disease and death when I have these precious gifts around. When\nJoshua does the funny things that he does, I take these as God-given opportunities\nto think out of the HIV box.\nOh yes, I lose it sometimes when Joshua is being a holy terror. But I try and view\nthese as time-outs from HIV.\nSense and sensitivity\nI\u2019m grateful that my children don\u2019t judge me on account of my HIV status. When\nJoshua rushes to give me antiretroviral drugs, I feel loved and cared for.\nJoshua still doesn\u2019t fully understand why his mother has to take all these drugs\nevery day, like clockwork, but he doesn\u2019t have burnouts. He\u2019s a great treatment\nbuddy.\nUnlike Peter, Joshua does not know about the bad old days. He\u2019s adored by everyone\naround him, and doesn\u2019t know the agony of stigma and discrimination.\nJoshua has only seen me receiving awards and accolades. He hasn\u2019t seen the\nclubs that were swung at me, and the unkind words that were served to us every\nday.\nAs Joshua grows older, I want him to be sensitive to the plight of people who are\nunfortunate or who are living with challenges. I know if, for instance, other children\non the school playground would\u2019ve been sensitive to Peter, it would have made a\nbig difference.\nThe best part is that Joshua has seen me living and ministering to infected and\naffected children. Without being told, he knows the right thing to do. But then\nagain, I know it will make a bigger impact if he hears the gospel of sense and sensitivity\nfrom the horse\u2019s mouth.\nI love the fact that Joshua has a relationship with his father. That\u2019s essential. I was\ndaddy\u2019s little girl, and it made me who I am. So I know what it means for a child to\nhave a father figure in their life.\nThat\u2019s not to say that single mothers aren\u2019t up to scratch in the parenting department.\nLook at me. I brought up Peter single-handedly, and he turned out good. But\nI\u2019ll be the first to admit that had his father been around \u2013 or had he had a father\nfigure \u2013 he would\u2019ve turned out even better. It\u2019s only the other year that he asked\nabout his paternal relatives, and I had to let him find his roots.\nLike all couples, my partner Richard and I have our issues, but I thank him for being\naround and nurturing our children. His presence and input makes a world of a\ndifference.\nHappy birthday, Joshua.\nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother-of-three who tested HIV-positive\n23 years ago.
