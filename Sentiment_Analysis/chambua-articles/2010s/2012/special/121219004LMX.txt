{"text": "IT\u2019S YOUR LIFE; DECIDE WHAT SUITS YOU BEST\n\nBreaking the silent\nvow of complicity\n\nPHYLLIS* ISN\u2019T IN MY inner circle of close friends, but our closeness has been\ngrowing. I\u2019m careful how I talk to her because I don\u2019t want to impose my values on\nher.\nI met Phyllis not so long ago at a graduation party. She was quick to notice my\narrival, and immediately showed me where to seat then introduced herself.\n\u201cI religiously read your newspaper column, but that\u2019s not what I want to talk\nabout. There\u2019s something I want to share with you.\n\u201cI have had HIV for 12 years. I only knew of my seropositive status after my husband\ndied. Not so long afterwards, my daughter who was only months old, also\ndied. That\u2019s when my husband\u2019s doctor called me and informed me that it would be\nbetter if I was tested for HIV. He didn\u2019t disclose any other information.\u201d\nLiving large, but empty\nWhen Phyllis tested HIV positive, one of her sisters-in-law was called, without\nher approval, to \u201chandle the situation\u201d. Phyllis was surprised that the doctor didn\u2019t\nwant to discuss anything before her sister-in-law came. His reason? The family was\nvalued more than her as an individual.\n\u201cI was immediately told to start on medication. I only came to learn that I had\nbeen given antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) later.\n\u201cI was also given other instructions. My HIV status was to be a top family secret\nbecause my in-laws are a high profile family. Disclosure of my HIV status would reveal\nwhat killed my husband, and soil the family\u2019s reputation.\u201d\nPhyllis was told not to worry as her in-laws were committed to give her whatever\nshe wanted. She only needed to tow the line.\n\u201cBut I feel like I\u2019m breaking down. I\u2019m living large \u2026 in a seven bedroom house\nwith two house-helps, but I\u2019m still empty inside because there\u2019s no one to talk to.\u201d\nLiving someone else\u2019s life\n\u201cI\u2019d rather live in a makeshift structure where I feel complete, than live in a mansion\nthat\u2019s devoid of so many things,\u201d Phyllis told me.\nShe is 30, and she feels like time isn\u2019t on her side. I know Phyllis doesn\u2019t want to\nlive someone else\u2019s life, but it\u2019s up to her to make the tough choice and break this\nsilent \u201cvow\u201d of complicity.\n\u201cI don\u2019t talk to anybody about my HIV status, apart from the doctor \u2026 and he\ndoesn\u2019t have the time of the day for me. He only packs the medicines and gives me\nthe day for my next appointment.\n\u201cAsunta, I need to talk to people who can understand me and what I\u2019m undergoing.\u201d\nPhyllis told me that her only means of interaction on issues of HIV is through this\nweekly column: \u201cI read and reread it.\u201d\nWhen Phyllis comes to see me, she wants to discuss how she can get a baby. I\ndon\u2019t have a manual to refer to for her case.\nAs the party speeches began, we postponed our t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate.\nI feel like Phyllis lives in the shadow of this \u201croyal\u201d family. When we next meet, I\nwill encourage her to choose what suits her best, because it\u2019s her life.\nLiving a lie\nIf I were to bring in my own values, I\u2019d look at it this way: why should I live in the\nshadows of someone else\u2019s affluence? Of course I would be rolling in it, yet deep\ninside my heart I\u2019d know I was living a big fat lie.\nI would want to have my own life, in my own space, without the interference or\ndirectives of \u201ctall\u201d relatives. These folks only care about their reputation, not the issues\nthat are near and dear to Phyllis.\nLife is more than eating and drinking or living in a good house. What counts most\nin our lives are the relationships we have established.\nThat\u2019s what our group therapy sessions are about. And it\u2019s what Phyllis is missing\nout on: folks who are in her shoes and genuinely feel her.\nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother-of-three who tested HIV-positive\n23 years ago. She is the executive director of the Kenya Network"}
