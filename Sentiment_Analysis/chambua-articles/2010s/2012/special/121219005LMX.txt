{"text": "Wednesday, December 19,\u00a02012\nBreaking the silent vow of complicity \nBy ASUNTA WAGURA\nPHYLLIS* ISN\u2019T IN MY inner circle of close friends, but our closeness has been growing. I\u2019m careful how I talk to her because I don\u2019t want to impose my values on her. \nI met Phyllis not so long ago at a graduation party. She was quick to notice my arrival, and immediately showed me where to seat then introduced herself.\n\u201cI religiously read your newspaper column, but that\u2019s not what I want to talk about. There\u2019s something I want to share with you.\n\u201cI have had HIV for 12 years. I only knew of my seropositive status after my husband died. Not so long afterwards, my daughter who was only months old, also died. That\u2019s when my husband\u2019s doctor called me and informed me that it would be better if I was tested for HIV. He didn\u2019t disclose any other information.\u201d\nLiving large, but empty\nWhen Phyllis tested HIV positive, one of her sisters-in-law was called, without her approval, to \u201chandle the situation\u201d. Phyllis was surprised that the doctor didn\u2019t want to discuss anything before her sister-in-law came. His reason? The family was valued more than her as an individual.\n\u201cI was immediately told to start on medication. I only came to learn that I had been given antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) later.\n\u201cI was also given other instructions. My HIV status was to be a top family secret because my in-laws are a high profile family. Disclosure of my HIV status would reveal what killed my husband, and soil the family\u2019s reputation.\u201d \nPhyllis was told not to worry as her in-laws were committed to give her whatever she wanted. She only needed to tow the line. \n\u201cBut I feel like I\u2019m breaking down. I\u2019m living large \u2026 in a seven bedroom house with two house-helps, but I\u2019m still empty inside because there\u2019s no one to talk to.\u201d\nLiving someone else\u2019s life\n\u201cI\u2019d rather live in a makeshift structure where I feel complete, than live in a mansion that\u2019s devoid of so many things,\u201d Phyllis told me. \nShe is 30, and she feels like time isn\u2019t on her side. I know Phyllis doesn\u2019t want to live someone else\u2019s life, but it\u2019s up to her to make the tough choice and break this silent \u201cvow\u201d of complicity. \n\u201cI don\u2019t talk to anybody about my HIV status, apart from the doctor \u2026 and he doesn\u2019t have the time of the day for me. He only packs the medicines and gives me the day for my next appointment.\n\u201cAsunta, I need to talk to people who can understand me and what I\u2019m undergoing.\u201d \nPhyllis told me that her only means of interaction on issues of HIV is through this weekly column: \u201cI read and reread it.\u201d\nWhen Phyllis comes to see me, she wants to discuss how she can get a baby.\u00a0I don\u2019t have a manual to refer to for her case. \nAs the party speeches began, we postponed our t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate. \nI feel like Phyllis lives in the shadow of this \u201croyal\u201d family. When we next meet, I will encourage her to choose what suits her best, because it\u2019s her life. \nLiving a lie \nIf I were to bring in my own values, I\u2019d look at it this way: why should I live in the shadows of someone else\u2019s affluence? Of course I would be rolling in it, yet deep inside my heart I\u2019d know I was living a big fat lie.\nI would want to have my own life, in my own space, without the interference or directives of \u201ctall\u201d relatives. These folks only care about their reputation, not the issues that are near and dear to Phyllis. \nLife is more than eating and drinking or living in a good house. What counts most in our lives are the relationships we have established.\nThat\u2019s what our group therapy sessions are about. And it\u2019s what Phyllis is missing out on: folks who are in her shoes and genuinely feel her.\nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother-of-three who tested HIV-positive 23 years ago.
