{"text": "LETTER FROM LONDON IGerry Loughran\nWhen the Aids virus is used as a weapon \u2022\u2022\u2022\nAs of 2010, at least\n600 people were\nconvicted of criminal\ntransmission of HIV\nLeslie Pringle, an awardwinning\nphotographer,\nhad been HIV positive\nfor nine years when he had\nunprotected sex with his girlfriend.\nThe couple later split up but\nthen the woman became ill with\nvomiting, stiffness in her joints,\na burning sensation in her eyes\nand a skin rash. Tests revealed\nshe, too, was HIV positive.\nAt Newcastle Crown Court,\na jury found Pringle guilty of\ninflicting grievous bodily harm\nby infecting his former partner,\nidentified in court only as X,\nwith the virus. He was detained\nin custody for sentencing in\nNovember.\nProsecutors said Pringle\nhad failed to take his medication\nand missed some medical\nappointments.\nPringle told police he had\nbeen devastated by his diagnosis.\n\u201cI told nobody about it.\nI tried to ignore it, to put it in\nthe bottom drawer and push\nit away.\u201d\nThe situation came to light\nwhen the girlfriend confronted\nPringle at his studio in a rage\nand then reported him to the\npolice. Pringle said: \u201cNext\nevening I tried to hang myself\nand the cable snapped, then I\nput myself in the River Tyne\nbut your survival instinct\ncomes in.\u201d\nThe case was the first of its\nkind dealt with by Northumbria\nPolice and only the third\nto be prosecuted in the north\nof England. But worldwide an\nincreasing number of people are\nbeing prosecuted for transmitting\nthe virus to their sexual\npartners, either \u201cdeliberately\u201d\nor \u201crecklessly.\u201d\nThe first conviction in the\nUK in March 2003 was of Mohammed\nDica, Kenya-born with\nfamily in Somalia. Dica, living\nin London, was found guilty of\ncausing grievous bodily harm to\ntwo women by recklessly transmitting\nHIV. He was sentenced\nto eight years but this was cut\nto four and a half years after a\nseries of appeals and retrials.\nAs of 2010, at least 600 people\nwith HIV in 24 countries\nwere convicted of criminal\ntransmission of the virus, and\nin several cases murder charges\nhave been laid when the infected\npartner died. Some libertarian\nand human rights groups,\nhowever, argue against criminalisation\non grounds that while\nHIV is unpleasant to live with,\nit is no longer a death sentence.\nWith modern anti-retroviral\ndrugs, HIV positive people\ncan live with a good quality of\nlife for many years.\nNot all criminal transmission\ncases have involved intercourse.\nIn 1998, Richard Schmidt, a\ndoctor from Louisiana, USA,\nwas accused of infecting his\nlover, Janice Trahan, a nurse, by\ninjecting her with HIV-infected\nblood. Trahan said Schmidt injected\nher with blood from one\nof his HIV-positive patients as\nan act of vengeance after she\ntried to end their relationship.\nSchmidt was jailed for\n50 years.\nIn the same year in Illinois,\nBrian Stewart, a medical technician,\nwas sentenced to life\nin prison for injecting his son,\naged 11 months, with HIV-contaminated\nblood to avoid paying\nchild support. He told the boy\u2019s\nmother not to bother seeking\nfinancial assistance because the\nchild would not live beyond the\nage of five.\nThe boy was diagnosed with\nfull-blown Aids in 1996 and was\nnot expected to live beyond the\nage of six. But with advances in\ntreatment of Aids, he completed\nhigh school, has a girlfriend and\nlives an active social life.\n* * *\nIt is a problem which sports\nfans in Britain thought was all\ndone and dusted \u2013 racism in\nfootball. But a number of incidents\nrecently involving players\nagainst players, and fans against\nplayers have brought it to the\nfore again, both at home and\noverseas.\nA report by a House of\nCommons select committee\nconcluded that racism remains\n\u201ca significant problem\u201d\nin British football. One of the\ncommittee members lamented\na lack of ethnic diversity in\nmanagement and board room\npositions at many English\nclubs. There is only one black\nmanager of a Premiership club,\nChris Hughton at Norwich, and\nmost boards are all-male and\nall-white.\nSpats on the field involved\nLuis Suarez, a South American\ninsulting Patrice Evra, a black\nFrenchman, and John Terry, a\nwhite Englishman, anathematising\nAnton Ferdinand, a black\nEnglishman.\nSome black players, among\nthem Rio Ferdinand, brother\nof Anton, are boycotting the\norganisation Show Racism\nthe Red Card on grounds it is\nnot aggressive enough.\nAlthough racist chanting\nand monkey noises have disappeared\nfrom the terraces in\nBritain, such displays have disfigured\nmatches in Euro 2012.\nAnti-racist groups complain\nthat UEFA, European football\u2019s\ngoverning body, hands\ndown derisory penalties to the\nguilty clubs, especially those in\neastern Europe and sometimes\nIberia.\n* * *\nContinuing on the theme of\nlove and marriage, here is a\ncynical view:\n\u201cI never knew what real happiness\nwas until I got married,\nand by then it was too late.\u201d\n\u2026 and a silly one:\nTwo little boys attended a\nwedding and one asked the\nother, \u201cHow many women can\na man marry?\u201d \u201cSixteen,\u201d said\nhis friend. \u201cDidn\u2019t you hear the\nvicar? Four better, four worse,\nfour richer, four poorer.\u201d\nGerryo69@hotmail.com"}
