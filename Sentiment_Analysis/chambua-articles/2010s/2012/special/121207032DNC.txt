{"text": "BACKING | Kenyans \u2018shunning HIV test\u2019\nMuslim rights\nlobby gives nod to syringe drive\n\nMuhuri says programme\nwill help reduce spread\nof HIV and Aids among\nintravenous drug users\nand fight addiction\nA human rights lobby has asked\nthe government to ignore\ngroups opposing distribution\nof syringes to drug addicts in Coast\nand fully implement the drive.\nMuslims for Human Rights\n(Muhuri) in a press statement yesterday\nbacked the Needles and Syringes\nProgramme (NSP), saying it reduces\nthe spread of HIV virus among intravenous\ndrug users.\n\u201cMuhuri wishes to call for the initiation\nof needle and syringe programme\nfor injecting drug users,\u201d said Muhuri\nexecutive director Hussein Khalid.\n\u201cIn countries where NSP has been\nintroduced, HIV infections have been\nconfirmed to have dropped by 25\nper cent. Our neighbour Tanzania\nis fighting the menace through the\nprogramme. Why should we lag?\u201d\nhe asked.\nMuhuri Rapid Response programme\nofficer Francis Auma said groups campaigning\nagainst the programme were\ndoing so out of ignorance.\nTo be lenient\n\u201cLet them do their research well,\u201d\nhe said.\nThe group also appealed to the government\nto be lenient on drug users\nby ensuring they are not arrested and\njailed but are instead treated at drug\nrehabilitation centres.\nThe call and support by Muhuri\ncomes a week after the national antidrug\nabuse agency (Nacada) issued\na warning that the programme was\nlikely to fail unless the government\ncounters a Muslim religious campaign\nagainst it.\nThe government plans to distribute\neight million syringes and needles to\nmore than 26,000 drug users through\nthe programme.\nSeparately, an anti-HIV and Aids\nlobby has warned that the gains made\nin the fight against the disease may be\nreversed unless advocacy campaigns\nare re-introduced and people urged to\ngo for testing.\nAids Healthcare Foundation Mombasa\nprevention coordinator Mary\nNyatuthi yesterday said people were\nnot going for the HIV test.\n\u201cSixty per cent of the over 2,300\npeople we tested last week during\nWorld Aids Day celebrations are\nrepeat testers. Only 40 per cent are\nnew clients,\u201d she said in a phone\ninterview.\nShe said the low figures were as a\nresult of people\u2019s lack of worry over\nthe disease and stigmatisation of the\ninfected.\n\u201cPeople have changed their focus\nfrom the disease over time and the\nworry, especially among girls and\nwomen, is getting pregnant and not\nthe disease,\u201d she added.\nMs Nyatuthi noted that stigma\nhad made many people reluctant to\nbe examined.\nShe added that some Kenyans\nwere also not going for the test due\nto wrong assumptions that if their\npartners are negative, then the same\nscenario applies to them.\nOverall, the coordinator said, more\nfemales than males were willing to be\ntested, with 57 per cent of the people\ntested that week being females."}
