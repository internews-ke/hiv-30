{"text": "Mother-to-child care the key to falling  infections\nBRIAN YONGA\nnewsdesk@ke.nationmedia.com\n\nMary Awuor, 23, checks\ninto the Orodi district hospital\nin Ndhiwa, Homa Bay\nCounty with her nine-month\nold baby.\nShe has walked less than\na kilometre from her home\nto the hospital where she\nqueues with her baby for\nprevention of mother-tochild\ntransmission treatment\n(PMTCT).\nMary tested HIV-positive\neight years ago, and two of\nher children died from the\nvirus. But thanks to the decentralisation\nof Maternal\nand Child Health (MCH)\nclinics to remote areas and\nthe integration of PMTCT\nand Maternal and Child\nHealth (MCH) services\nher third baby has tested\nnegative.\n\u201cI lost two of my children\nto the virus because there\nwas no one to advise me on\nhow I to raise my children in\nthe right way; moreover the\nhospital was almost 30 kilometres\naway,\u201d she said.\nFor years, the only hospital\nin the region that offered\nPMTCT and MCH services\nwas the Ndhiwa district\nhospital which is about\n30 kilometres from Orodi.\nGetting to Ndhiwa was also\na challenge because of the\npoor state of roads and the\nexpense.\nThis meant that for many\nyears HIV-positive mothers\nin Ndhiwa district could not\naccess the services to protect\ntheir HIV-exposed infants\n(HEI) from testing positive\ndue to the failure to attend\npostnatal care classes.\n\u201cI gave birth to my two\nchildren at the Ndhiwa district\nhospital, and when I was\ntold they were positive, I was\nafraid and very saddened by\nthe news. The fear made me\nkeep away from the hospital,\nand I ended up losing them,\u201d\nshe adds.\nThe situation was bad in\nthe district in October 2010;\nthe HIV prevalence rate\nstood at 35.9 per cent with\nnew infections registered\namong new-born babies\naccounting for half of the\nnumbers.\nBut as a result of the MCH\nfacilities in many remote\nareas and the integration of\nthe services, the prevalence\nrate has come down drastically.\nBut according to Dr Justus\nOcholla of District Aids Sexually\nTransmitted Infections\nOrganization (Dasco) Kenya,\nin 2011 the prevalence rate\nstood at 22 per cent while\nby October this year it had\nremarkably come down to\n13.9 per cent.\n\u201cThe integration models\nhave worked wonders in\nthese remote areas; the\nstaff at these centres have\nbeen trained and are committed\nto ensuring that the\nrate comes further down,\u201d Dr\nOcholla said.\nThe MCH clinics were\nopened in 2010. According to\nHellen Anayngo, the nurse in\ncharge at Orodi dispensary,\nthe number of mothers\nvisting the institution has\nincreased since 2010 when\nthe number of mothers who\nvisited the health facility in\na month was about 10. But\ntoday the hospital reveives\nbetween 20 to 30 mothers\nin a month.\n\u201cThis has greatly decreased\nthe number of deaths of newborn\nbabies because the\nmothers are given care right\nfrom birth up to 18 months,\u201d\nMs Anyango said.\nEach mother has a file at\nthe hospital where they are\nmonitored closely until the\nbabies are out of danger. The\nhospital has also got peer\ncounsellors who are charged\nwith the task of following up\non mothers who fail to keep\nup with the treatments."}
