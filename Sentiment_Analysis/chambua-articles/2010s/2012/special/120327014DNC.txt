{"text": "TALKING POINT SHORT TAKES\nMoral crusaders against condom ad\nare part of the problem in Aids war\n\nThe proverbial ostrich with a\nknack for burying its head\nin the sand would have been\nvery much at home in Kenya. This\nis because Kenyans not only like\nburying their heads in the sand, but\nalso cherish living in self-denial.\nThe case in point is the heat that\nwas generated by \u201cWeka Condom\nMpangoni\u201d advert. This was a public\ncampaign encouraging use of\ncondom among women in sexual\nrelationship outside marriage.\nThe heat forced Population\nService International, who are the\nsponsors of the campaign, to suspend\nthe advert on March 19 amid\nmounting protests from religious\nleaders as debate for and against\nthe advert raged in the social media.\nIronically, religious leaders who\nare up in arms against the advert\nhave a representative who sits in\nthe National Aids Control Council\n(NACC) board that came up with\nthe advert.\nThose whose ire has been drawn\nby the advert describe it as immoral\nand misleading. According\nto them, women are depicted as\ncheats. They also claim that the\nadvert encourages infidelity and\ncasual sex among Kenyans.\nIt is imperative to note that the\ncontroversial advert was informed\nby research that shows that married\ncouples are three times more\nlikely to be infected with HIV compared\nto prostitutes.\nThe Kenya AIDS epidemic update\n2012, described as the first comprehensive\nupdate of HIV and Aids\nepidemic in the country over the\nlast decade, gives grim statistics,\nwhich authorities say informed the\ncreation of the condom use advert\ncampaign.\nThe findings warn that more\nthan 44.1 per cent of all new HIV\ninfections are occurring in stable or\nlong-term relationships, including\nmarriages, and that 65 per cent of\nrecent infections occurred among\nwomen under 35 years while 40.1\nper cent for men aged 35-44 years\nwere victims.\nProstitutes accounted for a paltry\n14.05 per cent of new infections followed\nclosely by those engaging in\ncasual sex, like one night stands, at\n20.28 per cent. The report further\nestimated that 45 per cent of married\ncouples who are HIV positive\nhave partners who are not currently\ninfected, therefore putting their\ndiscordance at great risk.\nTragically for this country,\nreligious leaders and other selfanointed\nmoral crusaders will not\nlet those in the know deal with\nproblems at hand without erecting\nunwarranted hurdles. If they\nare not happy with such strategies,\nthe best they can do is to give the\nbest alternative of passing useful\ninformation.\nKIMANI WA NJUGUNA, Gatundu"}
