{"text": "Word from the joint United Nations Team on HIV and Aids\n Globally new infection among children have decreased from 550,000 in 2009 to 390,000 in 2011, and about half of women living with HIV worldwide are receiving antiretroviral treatment to prevent mother to child transmission of  the virus to their unborn children.\nIn 2001, world leaders at the United Nations High level meeting on Aids committed to eliminate new HIV infection among children by 2015 and keeping their mothers alive.\nThe commitment builds on past successes and country actions that have led to increases in the number of pregnant women living with HIV receiving prevention services. In addition, evidence from developed countries show that the number of new the number of new HIV infections among children and the number maternal and child deaths due to HIV was virtually zero.\nThe United Nations notes that Kenya has made tremendous progress in rolling out programmes to new infections among children but it is such great strides achieved elsewhere  that we are convinced that it is indeed possible  to eliminate new infections among children in Kenya all together. The campaign launched today to accelerate progress  towards universal access to prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV services is therefore timely, realistic and achievable.\nWe must acknowledge that to achieve this ambitious target, extraordinary political and technical  leadership to mobilize citizens to access must be employed. The shift  from doing business as usual and using new scientific and modern innovations will help strengthen programmes and structures to provide quality and equitable services across the country.\nMr Aeneas Chuma\nUN resident coordinator"}
