{"text": "WORLD AIDS DAY | More than three decades after HIV was identified as the cause of Aids, fewer than half of Kenyans know their status\nGroup members are using\ntheir own experiences to\nreach out to young people\nabout dangers of disease\nBY KENFREY KIBERENGE\nkkiberenge@ke.nationmedia.com\nKenya yesterday joined\nthe rest of the world in\nmarking World Aids Day\nat Afraha Stadium in Nakuru\nwhere the global campaign,\n\u201cGetting to zero: Zero new HIV\ninfections\u201d, was unveiled.\nIgnorance, misconception and a\ngeneral lack of information about\nHIV and Aids has been blamed for\nthe rise in infections more than\n30 years since the disease was\nidentified.\nData provided by the Public\nHealth ministry shows that only\n40 percent of Kenyans know their\nHIV status. In 2011, it is estimated\nthat 1.6 million to 2 million new\ninfections occurred in sub-Saharan\nAfrica and that one in four\nnew infections occurs in young\npeople from 13 to 24.\nA group of young Kenyans\nhave come out to tell their experiences\nand bust the myths as\nwell as combat stigma. Recently\nthey visited a secondary school in\nNairobi to counsel students about\nthe dangers of HIV and Aids.\nAt the start of the session,\nthe men and women \u2013 operating\nunder the aegis of Straight Plus\nyouth group \u2013 told the audience\nthat some of them were HIV positive.\nWhen they finally made the\nrevelation, the students were\ndumbfounded.\nImpossible to tell\nMadonah Syombua, the cofounder\nof Straight Talk \u2013 Straight\nPlus\u2019 mother organisation \u2013 says\nthe idea was to show the students\nthat it is impossible to tell the\nHIV status of a person by simply\nlooking at them.\n\u201cNowadays with the quality of\ntreatment we have around, it is\npossible to remain as healthy as\nanybody,\u201d she said.\nIt was evident from the deliberations\nwith the students that HIV\npositive people are considered\npromiscuous sexually reckless.\nBaffled by the misconception\namong the youth, the group\u2019s\nmembers, most of whom have\nlived with the virus for over two\ndecades having contracted it at\nbirth, have decided to use their\nexperiences to reach out to young\npeople in Kenya.\nJustin Maina, 24, learnt of his\nstatus in September 2010 after\nhe fell sick. His mother had died\nwhen he was a boy, and he heard\nthe doctors recommending that\n\u201cit\u2019s important all her children are\ntested\u201d. But he was too young to\nunderstand what was going on.\nIn 2010 he was diagnosed with\ntyphoid and given a prescription.\nBut lady luck was on his side. The\npharmacist told him he did not\nhave all the drugs.\nThis forced him to skip a few\ndays of work, but he did not recover.\n\u201cI returned to the hospital\nand had to take an x-ray which\nrevealed I had contracted TB,\u201d\nhe says.\nBy then, Maina was a teacher,\nand because his CD4 count stood\nat 231, he had been weakened and\ncould no longer attend classes.\nWhen the students and teachers\nlearnt of his status, he threw in\nthe towel because their attitude\ntowards him made him uncom\nfortable.\nBut after attending several\nseminars and support groups,\nMaina can now stand and talk\nto other young people. Although\nMaina is not sexually active, he\nsays people still accuse him of\nbeing promiscuous becuse of\nhis status.\nJoe Kamwo, 22, says it all\nstarted in 2004 after his mother\ndied when he was in Class Seven.\nA few days later, he was diagnosed\nwith TB. At the hospital, he was\ntold he would be given other drugs\nin addition to those for TB.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t told anything else, but\nmy grandmother and aunt cried a\nlot at the hospital. I sensed something\nwas amiss,\u201d he recalled.\nKamwo spent most of the time\nhe should have been in school revising\nfor the approaching KCPE\nexams at home. Nevertheless, he\njoined Form One but was often\nforced to stay at home to nurse\nsome opportunistic diseases.\nEventually, he decided to discontinue\nsecondary education\nand pursue a career in ICT. But\nKamwo, who was born with the\nvirus, says many young people are\nyet to appreciate the dangers of\nHIV and Aids. He says this is what\nhas moved him to come out and\nuse his experience to spread the\nmessage of zero new infections.\n\u201cLast year I was in a group\nof young men who were saying\nthey would rather sleep with a\nHIV-positive lady who is hot\n(beautiful) than an ugly lady who\nis HIV negative,\u201d he says.\nKamwo has since started antiretroviral\n(ARV) treatment and\nhas an HIV-negative girlfriend.\n\u201cWe both went to a VCT centre,\nand she knows I am positive and\nshe is negative,\u201d he said.\nMary Snaih, 20, says she learnt\nof her status in 2010 when she\nwas in Form Two. Her mother\ntook her to hospital where she was\ndiagnosed with the virus. She returned\nto school after counseling\non how to live positively.\nA year later, she returned to the\nhospital and was put on septrine\ntreatment to boost her CD4 count\nwhich had gone down. She was\nthen put on ARVs after the CD4\ncount increased.\nLike Kamwo, Snaih has a boyfriend;\nboth were tested. \u201cHe\nknows my status, and I know\nhis,\u201d she said.\nOn a random afternoon, Lillian\nKhabayi, 25, decided to visit\na VCT to get tested\u2013just for the\nfun of it. The results were positive,\nbut she chose to ignore them.\nBut in 2007 she had a strange\nskin disease, and her employer decided\nto send her to hospital. The\ndoctors informed her employer of\nher status but not her.\nWhen she later fell ill she moved\nin with her sister who initially\nscorned her. Her sister later informed\nher family who, luckily,\nwere supportive of her. \u201cThey\nnow remind me to swallow the\nmedicines,\u201d she says.\nBut Khabayi says she has experienced\nstigma from her uncle\nand cousins who spread word that\nshe was HIV positive and had to\nmove.\nIn 2010, she gave birth to a\nHIVnegative boy after meeting\na HIV-positive man. While\nmaintaining that the virus is\nno longer the death sentence it\nwas, she wants those uninfected\nto take caution and ensure zero"}
