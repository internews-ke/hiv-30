{"text": "Wednesday, November 21,\u00a02012\nWho will water the seeds of hope? \nBy ASUNTA WAGURA\nWHEN CATHERINE* CALLED ME saying she wanted to see me because no one understood her, I granted her audience. Catherine is a mother of two boys: a nine-year-old who is HIV-positive, and an eight-year-old who is negative. \nComing from an underprivileged background, Catherine lucked out, or so she thought, when she met a matatu driver. \n\u201cI sat in the front seat, and the driver was quick to strike up a conversation. Before long, we were chatting like old buddies.\u201d \nAs they say, \u201cone thing led to another\u201d. Soon, they were living as husband and wife, despite her parents\u2019 protestations.\nAt Kenwa (Kenya Network of Women with Aids), we\u2019re keen on economically empowering our members. Through seed money, we help underprivileged clients to start income-generating activities (IGAs).\nOur IGA programme has myriad challenges though. One is greenness. Most clients who access seed capital don\u2019t have the basic know-how to run sustainable businesses. \nThe other one that comes quickly to mind is the usual suspect: HIV. When we give our members seed capital, most have just recuperated from opportunistic infections. Or, they\u2019re caring for loved ones living with HIV. Caught between offering care and support and minding a fledgling business, the former always wins.\nNo free rides\nCatherine\u2019s husband was extremely loving and kind\u2026 until she announced that she was pregnant. \n\u201cWhy are young girls so careless nowadays, getting pregnant anywhere and anyhow simply because they\u2019ve been offered a\u00a0place to stay?\u201d the man raved.\nCatherine was beaten and ordered to pack and leave. Her parents took the matter to the wazee, and the man was fined Sh50,000 and ordered to keep his wife and unborn child. He paid Sh20,000 and they went back home. \nWhen she was three months pregnant, Catherine started to attend antenatal clinics. She was excited about having her baby, even if the timing had not been planned. After a few visits, it was time to get the results of her HIV test, which is mandatory in prenatal clinics. Everything had been explained to her but still, \u201cas\u00a0far as I was concerned, I was very far from HIV\u201d. \nCatherine was shocked when the nurse-in-charge told her she was HIV-positive. On breaking the news to her husband, he accused her of having known it prior to their meeting.\n\u201cWhy else did you go for the test?\u201d he berated her. \u201cIt was so that you could blame me, and I\u2019m not going to take that.\u201d \nAt week 28, Catherine was put on medication to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV. She packed her things and returned to her parents\u2019 home but she never returned to the clinic. When the baby was born, he tested HIV-positive. \n\u201cAfter I shared this with my family members, they quickly sent me back to where I had \u2018collected it\u2019. I returned to my husband and forced myself to stay as I took care of my sickly son. And then I conceived again.\u201d\u2028Someone had misinformed her that she could not conceive while breastfeeding. \n\u201cMy husband lost it. He expected me to \u2018take care of things\u2019 and not get pregnant again. He sent me packing once more.\n\u201cI spent cold nights on the streets before someone referred me to Kenwa.\u201d\nThree strikes \nWe have settled Catherine in a small room. However, for the second time her grocery business has flopped. I know where she\u2019s coming from: when her son falls ill, she abandons everything and solely focuses on him. That\u2019s what mothers do. \nI don\u2019t know how to communicate this to those who fund us. At times, no matter how determined a client is to succeed, things don\u2019t always turn up trumps. Besides, Kenwa\u2019s economic empowerment policy is firm: you can\u2019t be supported multiple times if your business fails. \nIn fact, I\u2019ve had to support Catherine from my own wallet for the second time. She\u2019s coming for a third helping, and I don\u2019t know how to proceed.\nThis isn\u2019t just about Catherine, though. It\u2019s about us. Catherine is merely the human face of issues facing millions of underprivileged Kenyan women.\nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother-of-three who tested HIV-positive 23 years ago.
