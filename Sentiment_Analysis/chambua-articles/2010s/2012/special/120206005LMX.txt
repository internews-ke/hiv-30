{"text": "My belated New Year resolutions\nLooking long and hard at things\n\u2013 from the Tana Delta clashes and\nthe road carnage in our country - I\u2019ve\ncome to the conclusion that I should\nface every day with the celebrations\nworth of a New Year day.\nThe other day I witnessed an ugly\naccident on the Thika Superhighway\nwhere almost an entire family perished.\nI wanted to stop looking, but\ncouldn\u2019t. I concluded that it is one\nthing leaving the house in the morning,\nand returning in one piece in the\nevening. This year my resolutions,\nalbeit belated, are to prune the things\nin my life that add no value. They are\nas follows;\nUNHEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS\nI\u2019ll definitely get rid of some blood\nrelationships because they\u2019re unhealthy.\nSome of these guys only call\nwhen they want money or other favours\nfrom me. But when I\u2019m in need\nI see nobody, or they don\u2019t return\nmy calls. I even send some of them\nmoney via Mpesa and I don\u2019t get an\nacknowledgement of receipt, leave\nalone a thank you. That is until the\nnext time they are in need.\nSome relatives have the habit of\nthinking I can actually foot all their\nbills. And this includes their wives\ngiving birth. It makes me wonder if\ngiving birth really is an emergency.\nOthers will\ncall when\ntheir children\nwant to join\ncollege or a\nnew school, calling\nlike their house is on\nfire.\nIt\u2019s common\nsense that you get\nchildren you\u2019re able\nto take care of without\ntrying to burden other people.\nThis list I will strike with a\nred pen. There\u2019s another group that\ncomes politely and borrows money\npromising to pay after they sort\nthemselves out. But you never hear\nfrom them until they want to borrow\nagain. And OMG they don\u2019t refer\nto the last money they borrowed.\nThis group will also be out of my list.\nBAD HABITS\nOne of the habits I must get rid of\nis lying. For this I\u2019ll partially blame my\nmobile phone. I \u2018excel\u2019 in this to an\nextent I\u2019ll tell someone I\u2019m actually\ncrossing the road or parking where\nwe\u2019re meeting, while I\u2019m actually\nalong Thika Superhighway.\nThe other one is giving false promises\nto people who are genuinely\nin need. I do this because I don\u2019t\nwant to look like a baddie, yet deep\nin\nmy heart I\nknow there\u2019s no way I\u2019ll\nmeet the required need.\nThis year I must learn to be woman\nenough to say no. I must stop the\nhabit of saying \u2018I\u2019ll look into it\u2019, while I\nknow there\u2019s nothing to look into.\nTo my children, I must go for\nstrictness training. Sometimes I\nfind myself bending the rules I\u2019ve\nmade because I don\u2019t want to argue.\nSometimes you\u2019d think I\u2019m their\ngrandmother; not their mother.\nSure enough, seeing the chinks in\nmy armour, Joshua wants to take\ncharge of me and the house. I\u2019ll look\ninto copying my mother\u2019s style of\ndiscipline.\nIMPULSE SHOPPING\nI have a bad habit of shopping,\nwhether I have money or not. I buy\nthings that I think are good at that\ntime, only to come and dump them\nin the house. I\u2019ll see them a year later\nand wonder what was I thinking\nwhen I bought them. Why, I have no\nuse for them at all. I end up giving\nthem out, not sure for what use.\nSLEEP LESS\nEver since I got Joshua in quick\nsuccession with Issa I\u2019ve had this\nlegitimate reason to oversleep in\nthe morning. Any questions arising I\nsquarely blame on the children. \u201cYou\nknow the baby did this or that.\u201d Yes,\nsometimes genuine excuses, sometimes\nnot.\nTime management\nI must have a time management\nplan every day and try not to fit into\nother people\u2019s programmes. At times\nit\u2019s like I\u2019m more on other people\u2019s\nplans than on mine.\nQUALITY TIME\nI\u2019ve been accused of being over-\nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura,\na mother-of-three who tested HIVpositive\n23 years ago.
