{"text": "HIV/Aids trend worrying\nStatistics on HIV/Aids have, in recent years,\ndemonstrated a decline in the rate of new\ninfections, giving hope that the war against\nthe pandemic was slowly being won.\nHowever, new information indicates that\nthe trend may have changed but the problem\npersists. Research evidence from the National\nAids and Sexually Transmitted Infections Control\nProgramme (Nascop) shows that many new\ninfections are being registered among new-born\nbabies.\nAccording to Nascop, 11,000 babies born every\nyear are HIV-positive, meaning that mother-to-child\ninfection is rising. Part of the reason is that many\nwomen fall victim to sexual violence, sometimes\nperpetrated by HIV-positive men, infecting them\nand in case of pregnancy, their unborn babies too.\nAdded to this are certain cultural practices such\nas wife inheritance, which in some cases force\nwomen into sexual relationships with HIV-positive\nmen.\nGiven the circumstances, new campaigns\ntargeting pregnant mothers, especially in rural\nareas and in urban slums, should be mounted\nto reduce mother-to-child infections, which are\nbecoming the new frontier for HIV-challenge."}
