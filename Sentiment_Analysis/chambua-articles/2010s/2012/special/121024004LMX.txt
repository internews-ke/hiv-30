{"text": "\nTHE BEST HEADLINE IS ONE IN SOMEONE\u2019S HEART\nSeparate awards from rewards\n\nI am an \u201cemail magnet\u201d. I receive tonnes of feedback. With the nature of my work,\nthis is not unexpected. I forward some of the emails to my staff for assistance\nbecause I do not know everything. There are also messages that I put in the \u201cTo\nAttend\u201d folder as I try to gather the relevant information before responding. Some\nemails have been there for yonks because exact answers have not been forthcoming.\nRecently, I fed this folder with two more emails. One is from a gentleman who\nthrew a curve ball of a request.\nOlympic dreams\n\u201cI\u2019m an athlete and I\u2019ve even competed in local full and half marathons. While in\nschool, I regularly scooped trophies for winning races,\u201d he explained.\n\u201cI want to participate in the Olympics, but I\u2019m no longer running competitively.\nHow can I become a torchbearer like you?\u201d\nPreviously, all I knew about the Olympics was that it was held every four years in\nthe country that won the bid. I had seen people on TV carrying the Olympic torch,\nbut I never bothered to know who they were or what they did to get there. I assumed\nthat it had to do with sports. And I am not a sports freak; my major contribution\nin this area is attending Joshua\u2019s sports day.\nFrankly, I do not know how to reply to the writer without crushing his Olympic\nexpectations. I do not know the criteria they will use to select the next torch bearers.\nOne thing I would recommend to this gentleman is to do what he does best. Sir,\ncarry and shine your torch in your arena.\nAs Mary was growing up, she did not know God had ordained her to carry Christ.\nWho knows, if she had had a hint, it might have been all over the social media. Folks\nwould have talked through their hats. I am sure God was aware of all this and in\nHis own right time, He sent the angel to deliver\nthe message.\nI do not know exactly what Mary\ndid to qualify for this noblest\nof tasks. Any woman, and that\nincludes yours truly \u2014\nforget about her medical\nrecords \u2014 would\nhave wanted to be in\nthis position. But only\nMary was honoured.\nFrom Mary\u2019s story, I\nhave learnt the wisdom of\nhanging out with those with\na similar vision. When she was\nvisited by the angel, she went\nto visit Elizabeth, who had\nalso been visited by the angel\nregarding the birth of\nJohn the Baptist.\nGreat decorations\nThe other email was on how I\ngot the Order of Grand Warrior\n(OGW), awarded by the Head of State. It was my first award, but I only came to\nrealise its importance much later.\n\u201cYou mean you have the OGW?\u201d people would ask, and it prompted me to start\nusing it in letters after my name.\nThis email that I received was from a woman who noted that my name is always\nfollowed by the abbreviations \u201cOGW\u201d. I am stuck how to respond to her question; I\nhave never known the criteria the Head of State uses to give this award.\nThere are many more awards, and my mouth can water, but I know I cannot\nreach some. Each coat is cut according to size. Some are for those who serve in the\narmed forces, academicians, athletes, and so on.\nSo to my good lady, I will say that I do not know how you can get there. Do whatever\nyou do to the best of your knowledge and capability such that, given another\nchance, you cannot improve since you gave your 110 per cent.\nAnd do not chase awards; let them do the chasing. When I got the OGW for\ncommunity service, Kenwa did not have an office. The team from the award committee\nhad to trek to all the slums looking for me to go for the award ceremony\nrehearsals.\nFrom these varied experiences, I know that the greatest decoration is not the one\nthat comes with titles after our names. Neither is it the one that makes headlines on\nnewsstands, but the one that makes a headline in someone\u2019s heart.\nI would advise both these people \u2014 like Mary and Elizabeth \u2014 to hang out with\npeople with a similar vision. Keep on dreaming and hoping and doing what you can\ntowards that goal. There is no dream that is too big.\nYou may not be feted the way you desire or deserve, but, like Denzel Washington\nonce said: \u201cMan gives the award, God gives the reward.\u201d\nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother-of-three who tested HIV-positive\n23 years ago.
