{"text": "Experts say manyof the\nresults found inaccurate\n\nBY KENFREY KIBERENGE\nkkiberenge@ke.nationmedia.com\nAn unknown number of Kenyans\nmight be holding false positive HIV\nresults, experts have warned.\nProf Omu Anzala, who led a team of\nresearchers in 2009 to author a report\nthat cast doubts on the accuracy of\nHIV tests carried out by local VCT\ncentres, says there are several error prone\ntesting points whose actions\ncould have untold consequences.\nSome HIV-positive Kenyans, he\nsays, might have been told they were\nnegative and vice-versa.\n\"False positives and false negatives\nare a reality in Kenya. Both are\ndangerous because if you are given\na false HIV-negative result then you\nmight infect others. You do not want\nto imagine the devastating effects in\nthe lives of people who are diagnosed\nas positive while in the real sense they\nare negative,\" Prof Anzala said.\nSince the launch of the report,\nProf Anzala says the situation has\nimproved, but warns that commercial\nentities remain a threat in the\nwar against the disease.\n\"I advise Kenyans to go to government\ninstitutions for HIV tests\nbecause it's free, they have quality\nassurance controls and the nurses\nfrequently get retrained on how to\nuse new testing kits,\" he said.\nProfAnzala, the director of Kenya\nAids Vaccine Institute, blames commercialised\nVCT centres for the\nerosion of faith in HIV tests.\nSome VCT centres in Nairobi\ncharge Shloo for the test which is\nfree in goverrunent institutions.\nKenya Medical Research Institute's\nDr Matilu Mwau says he would be\nsurprised if there were no false results\nout there.\n\"The rapid kits, which are the\nones used in Kenyan VCTs, are\nvery problematic. With the more\nexpensive PCR kits the rate of false\npositives and negatives is very low:'\nhe added.\nDr Mwau, who grabbed international\nheadlines 12 years ago as a\nPh.D student in the United Kingdom\nfor writing a thesis on the first ever\ngenetic Aids vaccine to go on trial,\nsays confirmatory tests are mandatory\nwhenever rapid kits are used.\nChief Public Health Officer Kepha\nOmbacho, however, says there is no\ncause for alarm, adding that tests\nworldwide have a negativity and\n\"The government must crack\ndown on these VCTs that are\nemploying quacks for quick\nriches and ensure that they\noperate according to the laid\ndown standard operating\nprocedures\"\nProf Omu Anzala, Kenya Aids\nVaccine Institute\npositivity problem.\n\"The question in the current case\nwould be 'which facility and personnel\nhandled it?'\" Mr Ombacho said.\nIn Joseph's case, an investigation\nestablished that neither the facility\nlior the doctor were licensed by their\nrelevant professional bodies to carry\nout HIV tests.\nAlthough this is the first time in\nKenya a patient has fought an HIV\nMisdiagnosis, there have been other\ninstances of faulty HIV tests.\nIn December last year, the government\nrecalled one million Standard\nDiagnostic Biotine (SDB) kits, manufactured\nby a South Korean company\nafter the World Health Organisation\n(WHO) found half of its test results\ncould be wrong.\nA 2009 survey published in the\nEast African Medical Journal cited\nthe Standard Diagnostic Bioline\nand two other rapid test kits widely\nemployed in Kenya as being responsible\nfor false results.\nKenya commonly uses Determine,\nBiotine and Uni-Gold. The first two\nare first-line tests while Uni-Gold is\nconfirmatory.\nThe survey found that Determine\ncould correctly identify only 45.70 per\ncent ofthose infected with HIV as carrying\nthe virus. Simply put, of every\n100 HIV-positive people, 54 could\nhave walked out of the VCT centre\nthinking they were InV-negative.\nThe survey also cast doubts on\nthe confirmatory test Uni-Gold. In\nNairobi's Kangemi slum, the Uni-Gold\ntest was found to have an accuracy\nof 99.13, meaning that out of every\n10,000 HIV-positive people tested, 87\nwould have been wrongly declared\nHIV-negative."}
