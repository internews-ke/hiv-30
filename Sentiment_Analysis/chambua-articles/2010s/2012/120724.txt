{"text": "FEARS I Millions may be defenceless\nExperts tell\nofAids drugs \nresistance\nCases that may not \nrespond to drugs\nrose to 7.3 per cent\nin eastern Africa\nPARIS, Monday\nResistance to Aids drugs,\na problem that has been\nwidely feared over the\nlast decade, is growing in parts\nof  Africa but should not ham4\nper the life-saving drug rollout,\nresearchers reported today.\nTiny genetic mutations that\nmake HIV immune to key frontline\ndrugs have been increasing\nin eastern and southern Africa,\nsomething that should\nbe a clear warning to health\nwatchdogs, they said.\n\"Without continued and\nincreased national and international\neffort.s, rising HIV\ndrug resistance could jeopardize\na decade-long trend of\ndecreasing HIV/Aids-related\nillness and death in low- and\nmiddle-income countries,\"\nthey said.\nThe study, published in The\nLancet, is funded by the Bill\nand Melinda Gates Foundation\nand the European Union\n(EU).\nIt is the widest-ever analysis\nof a risk that has haunted Aids\ncampaigners since 2003, when\ndrugs started to be rolled out to \npoorer countries that are home\nto more than 90 per cent of\npeople with the Aids virus.\nThe nightmare is that\n- as with bacteria which become\nresistant to antibiotics\n- strains of HIV will emerge\nthat will blunt the armoury of\nantiretrovirals, leaving millions\ndefenceless. Silvia Bertagnolio\nfrom the UN's World Health\nOrganisation and Ravindra\nGupta at University College\nLondon looked at published\ncases of HIV resistance and\nsupplemented this with data\nfrom the WHO itself.\nOver eight years, prevalence\nof resistant virus in untreated\npeople soared from around one\nper cent to 7.3 per cent in eastern\nAfrica, and from one per\ncent to 3.7 per cent in southern\nAfrica, they found.\nSimilar rates of 3.5-7.6 per\ncent were also found in western\nand central Africa, Latin\nAmerica and the Caribbean.\nThe difference, though,\nis that they remained quite\nstable throughout this period,\nand did not experience such\na big rise.\nThe mutations were found\nin strains of HIV-l virus that\nmade them resistant to a\nclass of drugs called non-nucleoside\nreverse transcriptase\ninhibitors, or NNRTIs. These\nare the first-option treatments\nfor HIV infection. (AFP)"}
