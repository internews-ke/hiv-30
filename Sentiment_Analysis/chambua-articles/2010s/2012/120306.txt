{"text": "March 6,\u00a02012\nWe are ready to pay tax, say sex workers\nSex workers have said they are ready to remit taxes to the government as long as they are recognised and their rights protected.\nThe Kenya Sex Workers Alliance (KESWA) Tuesday argued that they are in an \u201cindustry that controls massive revenue\u201d which would otherwise contribute to the economy of the country if tapped by the taxman.\n\u201cThere is a lot of revenue in the industry and we are ready to pay our taxes if the government decriminalises sex workers in this country,\u201d said Doughtie Ogutu, one of the KESWA founders. \nTheir position came just weeks after Nairobi Mayor George Aladwa formed a committee to check whether prostitution should be legalised in the city.\nThe committee, led by assistant town clerk in charge of reforms Daniel Masetu was mandated to analyse city by-laws that make prostitution illegal and advise the mayor. However, until then, Mr Aladwa said frequent crackdowns on prostitution would continue.\nThe sex workers claimed they were in it by choice because they are adults and no one should condemn them but recognise them as a way of fighting HIV and Aids. \n\u201cWho says that people should judge others? Who knows what people do behind doors? There\u2019s only one being who should judge us and that is God. If we have sinned, it is Him who should say so,\u201d said John Mathenge, the KESWA Coordinator.\nThe Ministry of Health estimates that at least 30 per cent of HIV patients are sex workers or those who bought sex from them. The National Aids Control Unit indicates that another 15 per cent of new infections occur among prostitutes.\nIt\u2019s not clear how many sex workers there are in Kenya, but the Unit shows that there are 7,000 commercial sex workers in Nairobi alone. KESWA claimed it had 40,000 followers.\nOn Tuesday, they held a demonstration in Nairobi to mark the World Sex Workers\u2019 Day where they argued that they have been subjected to discrimination despite the country passing new laws for equality.\nProstitution for material gain may be outlawed under the Penal Code although the punishment meted to men is different from that given to women.\nUnder section 153 and 154, a man found to gain from prostitution \u201cin any public place\u201d is charged with misdemeanour, an offence liable for any term of sentence or corporal punishment on being found guilty for the second time. The woman on the other hand would be charged with felony.\nThey wore face masks and carried banners some reading \u201cMy body, my business\u201d, \u201cMy body, my choice\u201d and \u201cshow us the money for our health.\u201d \n\u201cSex workers are violated every day, but they are not able to access health and legal services because of discrimination.\n\u201cA lot of times some us are raped, but no one would believe or help us get treated,\u201d argued Ms Ogutu.\nWhile they acknowledged prostitution is illegal, they said they are ready to compromise with the government on how they should work within the available laws."}
