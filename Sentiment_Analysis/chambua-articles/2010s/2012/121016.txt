{"text": "HIV patients urged to rely more on doctors\n\nChurches have been urged to encourage their faithful living with HIV to visit hospitals instead of relying on divine healing.\nFormer Anglican Archbishop Benjamin Nzimbi said though\nGod heals, there is need for people to appreciate scientists and their work because they are also a blessing to mankind. The clergy also called for the testing of herbal medicines so as to guide the public on their usage. He was speaking during a meeting organized by a group that advocates for the rights of HIV positive people."}
