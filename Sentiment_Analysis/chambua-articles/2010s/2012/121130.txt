{"text": "November 30,\u00a02012\nBy FELISTA WANGARI\nPauline Zawadi is used to the gentle nudges of her mother and aunties about the need to get married like her age mates. As a 31-year-old woman, this sense of urgency from those around her is hardly unexpected.\nBut unknown to many of them, Pauline has been living with HIV since she found out her status six years ago. This, however, is not the reason for her being single as she has never lacked suitors.\nIndeed Pauline, a mother of an 11-year-old boy, is among many young HIV-positive adults who refuse to let the virus define their dating.\nThey neither restrict themselves to dating only HIV-positive partners nor settling for any man or woman out of desperation.\n\u201cI am pretty, employed, financially stable, and not sick. It is not about my HIV status. I am a woman like any other and I desire a man who makes me happy and accepts my son,\u201d says Pauline.\nWhen she decided that HIV would not restrict her dating, Pauline\u2019s only problem was how to go about it without hiding her status. She was aware that some men would flee once she revealed that she was HIV-positive. Handling rejection was, therefore, something Pauline was prepared for.\nMany infected people seek love via online dating sites and dating agencies that cater exclusively for HIV-positive clients.\nOne of the more visible ones is Stacy Care Foundation, run by Anastazia Wakesho, whose members are mostly in their 20s.\nPauline tried online sites and dating agencies, but it did not work. She then decided to set up a Facebook page with the avatar Pauline Gift Zawadi, where she anonymously met men interested in a relationship even after learning of her HIV status.\nDespite going on dates with various men she met through the platform, Pauline is yet to develop a concrete relationship.\nHowever, her other Facebook profile \u2014 the real one \u2014 does not refer to her HIV status. While Pauline believes that living with HIV should not be a deal-breaker, she knows that uninfected men may have a different view.\nShe, therefore, prefers to reveal her status to them early in the relationship, preferably by the third date.\nSafe sex\nForty-year-old Jacque Wambui has never been one to go out looking for men, preferring to let men find her instead.\nShe is now dating an HIV-negative man, and did not have the problem of disclosure since she has always been public about her status. Moreover, she and her boyfriend share the same faith and had known each other for 10 years before they started dating two years ago.\nHowever, there is always the small issue of intimacy. George, 24, a research assistant in Nairobi, believes that it would be futile to date an HIV-positive person because being intimate with them would be the equivalent of signing a death warrant.\nHis assertions are refuted by scientists, who have proved the possibility of safe intimacy and even giving birth to HIV-negative children. These assurances do little to change his mind.\nWhile some disclose their statuses early in the relationship, there are those who do not. Jane, 27, keeps a disturbing secret about the undisclosed status of an HIV-positive male friend who confided in her two years ago.\nShe found out that the man has been in a six-month relationship with a mutual friend, who was presumably negative before the relationship began.\n\u201cI feel awful about it, but at the same time I suspect that it may be too late to do anything as they have already been intimate,\u201d she says.\nJane says she cannot date an HIV-positive man and always insists on a test before getting intimate in a relationship, something some men do not take kindly.\n\u201cThey snap at me, accusing me of suggesting that they have loose morals. Many have walked away rather than submit to the test,\u201d she says in amusement.\nAn informal poll for this story revealed that many young people rarely bring up the issue of their HIV status when they are dating, even when they go ahead and get intimate, sometimes without protection.\nA common misconception is that physical appearance alone is enough to tell a person\u2019s status.\nFull disclosure\nPauline says men usually react in shock when she reveals her status, with some admitting that an attractive, smartly dressed and financially stable woman does not fit their idea of HIV and Aids.\nLast year, when she confessed her status to a man during their third date, he dropped his drink, grabbed his car keys, and ran away.\nHe, however, contacted Pauline a week later and said he was ready to give the relationship a chance. But his parents were not amused, forcing him to end the relationship.\nMany young and infected adults treat their HIV status as a closely guarded secret, but Florence Anam, 31, feels that the burden of disclosure has been unfairly left to the infected person.\nShe admits that in this era of Facebook dating and spontaneous sex, there is hardly ever space to discuss HIV.\n\u201cThe only time it ever comes up is when the couple wants to get rid of the condom,\u201d she says.\nSince revealing one\u2019s status and dealing with possible rejection is easier said than done, Florence advises those who have not made full disclosure to delay having sex or always use a condom.\n\u201cIf your status comes up, the person will have got a chance to know you and HIV will not come between you. Moreover, if you always used a condom, they will appreciate your effort to protect them,\u201d she says.\nFrom experience, Florence knows that disclosure is a gamble because there are people who simply walk away. However, some eventually return after processing the information and making an informed decision.\n\u201cPeople need to be careful about non-disclosure because it is better to deal with rejection than to be taken to court for recklessly exposing someone to HIV,\u201d she says."}
