{"text": "Love brought me pain but I will live and love again\u201d \nBy Kinuthia Mburu\nA narrow murram path leads to 30-year-old Cecile Asaji\u2019s house in Kakamega town. Small stones painted with whitewash lie on each side of the path. \nBehind them, two lines of freshly watered flowers stretch all the way to the veranda. The petals have only begun to embrace the warmth of the sun.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad the sun is out today,\u201d Cecil says, welcoming us into her house. \u201cIt\u2019s a good Friday.\u201d\nCurled up on her sofa looking relaxed and happy, Cecile is a warm lady to be around. But beneath her happy smile lies an undercurrent of despair, pain and rejection, only recently tempered by courage, hope and determination to once again reclaim her life.\nYou see, Cecile is HIV positive, and learning to finally win against the demons that once haunted her after the betrayal of her once-loving boyfriend.\nGrowing up the fifth child in a family of six, with an absent father, in Vihiga district, is where her story starts.\n\u201cMy father was a banker and my mother was a primary teacher,\u201d she says.\nOne month after her birth, her father left for the US to work and study, returning when she was 10. \nMissing father\nCecile recalls that although she had uncles to look up to, she still missed a father figure.\n\u201cI had only seen him in pictures. I wanted to be with him, to spend time talking about \u2018my dad\u2019, just like my friends did.\u201d \nNonetheless, Cecile\u2019s life was otherwise stable, and in 1997, she joined St. Mary\u2019s Girls\u2019 School in Mumias. In 1998, at the age of 16, Cecile was struck by Cupid\u2019s arrow. \nJames* was a close friend of her brothers, and someone familiar to her since childhood, even though he was substantially older than her. In 2000, she joined M\u2019mbale Progressive School in Uganda for her A-levels, but that did not deter love; James, who was in employment in Kisumu at that time, would often travel to see her. \n\u201cI was confident that he was a good catch,\u201d she says.\u201dI told myself that he wouldn\u2019t do all the bad things that men did to women. He filled the void that my father had left, and I felt that he was the only man who cared and loved me.\u201d\nCecile devoted herself to him, and dreamed of one day becoming his wife and the mother of his children. In 2003 she joined Kampala International University for her Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Mass Communication. \nWith more freedom and her own room, she could date and club as much as she wanted, but she opted instead to be faithful to James.\n\u201cIt looked like fun. At times I felt tempted to join in. But I didn\u2019t. I had a boyfriend back at home who was faithful. I could not bear to hurt him.\u201d\nCheating boyfriend\nThen in 2004, things began to fall apart. They began to squabble. His visits decreased in frequency.\n\u201cI sensed that something was eating into my relationship,\u201d Cecile remembers. Her friends thought there was another woman. Cecile sat him down and prodded him. \u201cHe claimed that his mother was very sick and needed to see some grandchildren (before she died),\u201d she says. \n\u201cI did not want to lose him, yet I did not want to bear a child out of wedlock.\u201d \nWhen her older sister had conceived out of wedlock their father had been very upset and almost kicked her out of the house, and so Cecile knew that the family would not take this kindly. But in the end, and at the age of 23, she gave in and conceived. \n\u201cCoincidentally, my father did not pay my fees that year, and I moved in with my boyfriend, which helped me keep it from my family.\u201d\nHowever, the arguments she thought would end with her conception went on. To add insult to injury, her boyfriend began to see another woman.\n\u201cSome days, he would come over to the house with her. I guess he wanted to humiliate me and force me to leave.\u201d \nCecile confronted the lady, begging her to leave \u2018them\u2019 alone. \u201cI felt like she was inducing our break-up, and told her to stop. After all, I was pregnant with his child. But she said that I had no business dating and should (concentrate on my studies).\u201d \nTowards the end of her second trimester, Cecile had a premature rapture of the membrane. \u201cIt happened at around 2pm. We did not have neighbours around and I was not familiar with the estate.\u201d \nBy the time James returned from work and took her to hospital, her condition had deteriorated. \u201cThe doctors said that my condition was critical. They removed the foetus to save my life.\u201d\nChris the playboy\nAfter returning to her boyfriend\u2019s from the hospital, the break up that had been simmering burst out.\n\u201cHe accused me of prostitution and negligence and kicked me out.\u201d\nHeartbroken and in physical pain, Cecile returned to her parents in Vihiga where she lied that she had been staying with a student in hope that her dad would send her fees. \n\u201cI did not speak about the pregnancy or the misconception.\u201d It was while she was there that she heard that John had married. \u201cI wondered what I had done wrong to deserve this. Hadn\u2019t I been faithful and submissive? Hadn\u2019t I loved enough? What did I lack?\u201d\nIn 2007, Cecile returned to campus for her final year. This time, she was sullen and withdrawn.\n\u201cI could not accept the fact that my relationship had ended. I felt unlovable, undesirable and unattractive.\u201d One day a man dropped by her room. \u201cHe said that his name was Chris* and some students in our row were his cousins.\u201d They began to converse.\n\u201cHe asked why I didn\u2019t know him, yet he knew me well. He claimed that he had graduated the previous year.\u201d From that day on, Chris began to drop by her room.\n\u201cHe began to ask for coffee dates. He wanted to date me. Having come from a hurtful relationship, and having a largely absentee father, I feared men. Yet, I needed someone to tell me what I wanted to hear: that I was alright.\u201d \nShe began to warm up to him. They began to date and sex became part of their relationship. \u201cAt first, we used condoms. But after some time, we began to have unprotected sex.\u201d \nThen Cecile began to hear stories that her new boyfriend was a serial player. It also turned out that he had never had cousins at the university. But what really shook Cecile was a fellow student\u2019s proclamation.\n\u201cShe cornered me on my way from the library and accused me of stealing her man. Then she said that I would be very wise to have an HIV test.\u201d \nConfused, Cecile stopped all physical intimacy with Chris two months after they had started. \u201cI demanded that we go for a test, or there would be no relationship.\u201d However, her boyfriend utterly refused and told her to go alone. \nTesting news\n\u201cI was totally unsettled and had to go for a test to be sure. The test came out negative!\u201d \nCecile broke up the relationship and swore to never date again. In early 2011, she got a job as banker in Eldoret \u2013 which she later lost due to illness. In August, her eyes began to swell and her skin developed severe blemishes. \u201cI went to Moi Referral Hospital and got hydrocortisones which eased the skin problem.\u201d \nA few weeks later, she began to develop blisters on her tummy.\n\u201cThe blisters came in tandem with strong fevers.\u201d Her aunt, who was a medic, heard about her problems and advised that they visit the hospital together. \u201cI hate jabs and I was very reluctant at first.\u201d The tests came out positive for herpes. \u201cI also tested HIV positive,\u201d she adds, with a breaking voice. \n\u201cI thought it was a joke. Hadn\u2019t I gone for a test that turned out negative?\u201d Her father broke the news to her siblings and other members of her extended family. \u201cI felt really hurt,\u201d Cecile says. In the following days, Cecile and her father could not see eye to eye. \n\u201cThere was cold hatred in his eyes whenever we met. He couldn\u2019t stay in the same room with me.\u201d Apparently, her father had a mistress who had repeatedly told him stories of Cecile being a husband snatcher in Eldoret town. He now believed that the stories were true.\nMeanwhile, Cecile\u2019s health deteriorated. She began to harbour suicidal thoughts. \u201cI thought, ah, if I just swallow all my ARVs, my suffering would end.\u201d\nBut a second thought told her that she would leave her first boyfriend, James, enjoying life. \u201cI blamed him. If he hadn\u2019t dumped me, I wouldn\u2019t have been infected. \nFrom despair to hope\nNow I wanted to infect him and his wife.\u201d They had recently gotten in touch, and Cecile decided to put her plan into action. Since he was once again showing interest in her, Cecile began to come around.\n\u201cHe apologised and promised to marry me as a second wife and love me more. He even bought piece of land where he wanted to settle me.\u201d Her plan was perfectly falling into place. \nJust about then, this January, she came upon an advertisement in a local paper for a HIV-positive networking group. \u201cThey were looking to network persons living with HIV/Aids.\u201d\nThrough the group, she met an evangelist who became her emotional pillar, and a social support network of people living positively with HIV who gave her hope.\n\u201cI met people with different experiences. Slowly, I came to see that I had not come to the end of the road. I could still live.\u201d \nShe began to let the pain go and stopped seeing her first boyfriend. \u201cI have kept a safe distance from him. Though my dad has refused to accept me, I hope that one day we will patch up.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Cecile\u2019s emotional healing continues. \u201cI may not have good feelings towards men, but I want to heal. I want to love and live again,\u201d she says with conviction.\u201dI want to be the woman I know I can be. And I will get there.\u201d\n* Names have been changed\nadvertisement "}
