{"text": "US urges male\nCircumcision to fight HIV\nin Africa\nMAPUTO. Tuesday\nMale circumcision is the best way to prevent\nnew my infections in the military, the head\nof US anti-Aids efforts told a gathering of top\narmy brass from Africa, Eastern Europe and\ncentral Asia.\n\"We believe male circumcision is a highly\nsignificant, lifetime intervention. It is a gift\nthat keeps on giving. It makes a lot of sense\nto put extraordinary resources into it,\" US\nglobal Aids coordinator Eric Goosby told the 400 delegates. The meeting on Aids and the military gathered officials from 80 countries, including most of Africa but also countries from Surinam to Georgia and Estonia. Studies show that circumcision can dramatically reduce HIV infections. One study in South Africa last year\nfound new infections fell by 76 per cent after a circumcision programme was launched in a township.\nIn 2006, trials in Kenya, Uganda and South\nAfrica found foreskin removal more than halved\nmen's risk of HIV infection. Longer term analysis has found the benefit to be even greater than thought, with a risk reduction of around 60 percent. The United States is sponsoring programmes in several African countries with a goal of circumcising four million men by 2013.\nResults so far are patchy. Although Kenya is close to reaching its target of 80 percent of sexually active men, Uganda has achieved less than five per cent of its target.\n''We need the military to take up some of these circumcisions,\" said Caroline Ryan of the US Global AIDS Coordinator's Office.\nOne issue she said is that the surgery requires soldiers to recuperate for two to four days, meaning time off from the army.\nAnother concern, raised by South Africa, was how to marry traditional coming-of-age rites with the need for circumcisions to be carried out under surgical conditions. \"Traditional circumcision is part of the path to manhood.\nFor us it is critical to be given strategies to deal with their concerns:' South African Brigadier\nGeneral Snowy Moremi.
