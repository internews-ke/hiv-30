{"text": ", February 24,\u00a02012\nThe Malian HIV warrior presidents can\u2019t say no to \n\t\u2022\t\\\nadvertisement \nBy DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.\nShortly after Michel Sidibe became executive director of the United Nations\u2019 AIDS prevention agency, a court in Senegal sentenced nine gay men, all AIDS educators, to eight years in prison for \u201cunnatural acts.\u201d\nIn one of his first moves as the new chief of UNAIDS, Sidibe flew to Senegal to ask its aging president, Abdoulaye Wade, to pardon the men.\nSidibe, the son of a Muslim politician from Mali and a white French Catholic, asked the president \u2013 who is married to a white Frenchwoman \u2013 if he had ever suffered discrimination.\n\u201cOh, Sidibe, you have no idea,\u201d came the reply. \u201cAnd for not marrying a Muslim.\u201d\n\u201cThen, Uncle,\u201d Sidibe said, using the African way to politely address an older man, \u201cwhy do you accept that men here are put in jail for eight years just for being gay?\u201d\nWade thought about it and promised to call his justice minister. Shortly afterward, the charges were dropped.\nAsked if his predecessor \u2013 Dr Peter Piot, a Belgian and one of the discoverers of the Ebola virus \u2013 could have gotten the same results, Sidibe said, \u201cWithout doubt, it would have been more difficult. It would be very automatically perceived as \u2018the white people moralising to us again.\u2019 Since I\u2019m African, I can raise it in a way that is less confrontational.\u201d\nCircumcision\nAsked about that, Piot laughed and agreed, saying he sometimes thought his African missions, like those of the U2 singer Bono, \u201cfelt like a junior Tanzanian economist and Hugh Masekela coming to Washington to scold Congress for its budget deficit\u201d \u2013 with Congress having to grin and bear it because it needed Tanzania\u2019s cash.\nSidibe, 59, is a former relief worker, rather than a physician, and, along with English and French, he speaks West African Mandingo, the Tamashek of the Tuaregs and other languages.\nWith a combination of bonhomie and persistence, he has delivered difficult messages to African presidents very persuasively in his three years in office: Convince your men to get circumcised. \nTell your teenage girls not to sleep with older men for money. Shelve your squeamishness and talk about condoms. Help prostitutes instead of jailing them. Ask your preachers to stop railing against homosexuals and order your police forces to stop beating them. \nLet Western scientists test new drugs and vaccines, despite the inevitable rumours that Africans are being used as guinea pigs.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t say \u2018no\u2019 to Michel,\u201d said Piot, who hired him away from Unicef. \u201cI was at a conference in Ethiopia in December, and for the first time, I felt I was hearing \u2018ownership\u2019 of AIDS by African countries. They weren\u2019t talking so much about the donors, but about it as their own problem. I think he had a lot to do with that.\u201d\nThanks, in part, to Sidibe\u2019s intensive lobbying, South Africa and China are rapidly revising their approaches to the epidemic, and he hopes Russia and India soon will too. \nAnd the notoriously conservative African Union has created a committee to help populations it previously ignored: homosexuals, prostitutes and drug abusers.\nSidibe is from so deep in Africa that his professional career actually began in Timbuktu, helping Tuareg nomads. (His grandfather, he said, was a Fulani nomad in the same desert.)\nHe has the African shtick down. He calls anyone younger than him \u201cmy brother\u201d or \u201cmy sister.\u201d He seems to remember, and hug, everyone he has met before, from drivers to senators to journalists. \nHe regales guests at cocktail parties with long parables about chameleons that he learnt as a teenager in circumcision school (a bonding ritual that many African men remember with a mix of fondness and terror \u2013 a cross between boot camp and a bar mitzvah, but ending with a collective bris, sometimes done with a spear blade.)\nAnd he is a relentless joker.\nIn South Africa, he passed through a maternity clinic in Soweto and greeted the women, whose bellies were bulging out of their robes. Ten minutes later, passing by again, he stopped.\n\u201cLadies, you are still waiting?\u201d he teased. \u201cWhat is happening here? You must complain.\u201d\nMinutes later, in the circumcision ward, he was introduced to a stunning young surgeon, Dr Josephine Otchere-Darko. \u201cOh, my goodness, my sister, it is too late for me,\u201d he said flirtatiously. \u201cBut do men here not mind being circumcised by a woman? In my country, it would be culturally impossible.\u201d\nSome men refused, Otchere-Darko acknowledged, but most didn\u2019t mind.\n\u201cLet us see,\u201d he said, wrapping his arm around her and sweeping her down the line to the first man waiting.\n\u201cMy brother, I am a doctor, and so is this beautiful young woman. Whom do you choose to do your operation?\u201d\nThe poor man gulped and looked nervously from one to the other, until Sidibe patted him on the shoulder and let him in on the joke.\nMinutes later, the kidding ended as he met with infected women who had just given birth.\n\u201cYou are the age of my last daughter,\u201d he said to a 21-year-old woman cradling her newborn. Crouching down so he could touch her knees, he asked if she knew how she had been infected.\n\u201cI am not sure,\u201d she answered softly, \u201cbut when I was 12, I was raped by my cousin.\u201d\nAnother cousin, sitting beside her, added, \u201cHe raped all of us girls in the family as we came of age.\u201d\n\u201cWhere is he now?\u201d Sidibe asked, clearly upset.\n\u201cHe is in jail,\u201d she said. \u201cBut not for that.\u201d\nGlobally, Sidibe says, he is trying to \u201cbe a voice for those without one.\u201d The groups that most need help, he argues, are the ones that no politician wants to be photographed with: gay men, prostitutes, transvestites, heroin users.\nThe only category in which there has been major progress is cutting transmission from mothers to babies.\n\u201cThat\u2019s populist,\u201d Sidibe noted. \u201cEven the Tea Party would not oppose that.\u201d\nWhile the global battle against AIDS is still being lost, it is being lost less badly. Four years ago, 250 people were newly infected for every 100 people getting treatment; that number is now down to 200.\nSidibe gives most of the credit for that to a combination of generosity of donors, particularly from the United States, and to mundane but important societal changes like adults having fewer extramarital affairs and parents talking to their children about sex.\nHe fights conservatives on his agency\u2019s board, even allowing one agency magazine to be printed with a busty beauty on the cover \u2013 and no clue until the photo spread on Brazilian transsexuals inside that she had once been a man.\nHe publicly congratulated India\u2019s \u201chijra\u201d community of eunuchs and transsexuals on a court\u2019s overturning of the country\u2019s 160-year-old colonial-era sodomy laws.\nSidibe has also fought hard against harsh anti-gay laws in Africa, against hate crimes like the \u201ccorrective rapes\u201d of lesbians by South African gangs \u2013 and against the widespread belief that homosexuality is a Western import. \nHe pressed China to admit that HIV was spreading rapidly among gay men and drug users and that the 500,000 Chinese working in Africa and 40 million migrant labourers, many of whom visit prostitutes, were potential risk pools. \nIn 2009, he appeared in an awareness campaign with the basketball star Yao Ming.\nChina, which Sidibe described as \u201cimmune to pressure, but very pragmatic,\u201d soon reversed several policies. Premier Wen Jiabao spoke at the UN in 2010 about holding the hands of AIDS patients, and zero-tolerance drug policies were dropped in favour of methadone and syringe-exchange.\nSidibe was also one of the first to call for changing global policy to \u201ctest and treat,\u201d which means putting infected people on drugs as soon as they are infected. \nWhile initially expensive for donors, it makes patients 96 per cent less likely to infect others, ultimately saving money.\nHe is, of course, frustrated that donors have cut back, and has endorsed the controversial proposed \u201cRobin Hood tax,\u201d which would charge a fraction of a cent on every currency exchange transaction, and channel it to global health programs.\nSidibe focuses his lobbying on the BRICS countries \u2013 Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. If each takes the lead in its region, he says, it will drag others along.\nFor example, without South African leadership, efforts in Lesotho and Mozambique will fail because their men work in South African mines and its hospitals are so advanced.\n\u201cIn my village they said: If you want to kill the snake, you must hit the head,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Africa, South Africa is the epidemic\u2019s head.\u201d\nSimilarly, he said, former Soviet satellites still depend on Russia and have similar heroin-driven epidemics, so he is pushing for syringe-exchange and methadone programs.\nSidibe attributes his diplomatic skills to his unusual family.\nHis father was sent to France during World War II and fell in love. \u201cHe was one of the first Africans married to a white lady, and when she came down to Mali in 1946, it was very difficult for them,\u201d Sidibe said.\nBoth families initially rejected the union, but they stayed married for 55 years, till his father\u2019s death.\nIn Marxist post-colonial Mali, Sidibe\u2019s father was a leader of the Social Democrats, risking imprisonment.\nSidibe had a traditional Malian birth, at home, with a midwife, protected by his grandmother\u2019s \u201cmagic water.\u201d\nHis first nickname was \u201cTrompe la Mort\u201d \u2013 Fooler of Death \u2013 because the umbilical cord was around his neck.\nHis family was well enough off to buy him shoes \u2013 which he always took off on his way to school so his classmates wouldn\u2019t find out.\nAnd when his brother, who was born in France and lived with his grandparents, finally rejoined the family at age 9, Michel, who was 6, had to fight for him every day. (One reason for the constant school punch-ups was that his lighter-skinned brother refused to admit being African; he also ran home at the first sign of trouble.)\nSidibe still calls his 88-year-old mother daily. When she saw him on TV getting an award from a US gay rights group, she asked, \u201cSo, my son \u2013 are you gay now?\u201d\n\u201cNo, Mama, not yet,\u201d he replied.\nBut his \u201ctrue mentor,\u201d Sidibe said, was a mentally ill man he used to pass on his way to school. \nHe slowly befriended the man, who was known as Makan the Geek, to protect him from other boys who threw stones.\nAnd when Makan was taken to an asylum, his mother let Michel take him food.\nHelping someone who offered no more than a mute smile in return, he said, was a good lesson in empathy.\nHis father also \u201ctold me to see people first as human beings, not as president or prime minister. That\u2019s why I can relate to a lady in the US or to King Mswati in Swaziland.\u201d\nAnd whenever he declares a new goal, like zero new mother-to-child infections, he describes it as the one he wants to retire on.\n\u201cIf we can win this one,\u201d Sidibe will say, \u201cI can go back home and sit under my mango tree and feel proud.\u201d\n-NYT Syndication"}
