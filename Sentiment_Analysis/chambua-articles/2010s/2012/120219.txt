(READ: Patients demand more funds for Aids drugs)\nKanco has a membership of 1,200 organisations involved in HIV related activities but, according to Ms Kibuchi, many more groups work outside this membership. \nWith the decline of funds and the downgrading of HIV emergency status, she says, most of the smaller groups will have to become more innovative, otherwise they will have to close shop.\nIn a 2009 census carried out by the National NGOs Coordination Board, the majority of the over 5,000 such organisations were involved in HIV programmes. This does not include the many community organisations found in all parts of the country.\nAccording to the National Aids Control Council (Nacc), it has one of the most diverse and extensive set of civil society partners where an estimated 14,000 of them are currently engaged in HIV and Aids-related activities.\nThe first signs of trouble came to the fore last year when the Global Fund informed Kenya and several other countries that they were not eligible to apply for the next round of funding because it was running short of cash. \nLater in October the global organisation was to cut all new funding for a period of two years.\nFaced with a shrinking funding base, civil groups increased pressure on the government to either step up its funding through the national budget or establish a national Aids trust fund to be funded through special taxation from earmarked corporates.\nHowever, sources close to the lobbyists indicate that the establishment of an Aids Trust Fund has been strongly opposed by local airlines and mobile phone companies who say any extra taxes on their services to support the fund would be an unwelcome burden to customers.\n\u201cOne airline has actually argued that such a tax could hurt the local tourism industry as it would make travelling to Kenya expensive,\u201d said a source who has been involved in the negotiations.\nSource of concern\nIn the last few months, the minister for Special Programmes, Ms Esther Murugi, has accused her Health counterparts Prof Anyang\u2019 Nyong\u2019o and Mrs Beth Mugo of failing to support the idea of a trust fund.\nMs Murugi under whose docket the highly donor-dependent National Aids Control Council (Nacc) falls, has been under intense pressure from local and international NGOs to provide political muscle for the push for more funding. \nThis pressure has been spearheaded by the US Advocacy for Health GAP.\nThe Nacc boss, Prof Alloys Orago, says that the shrinking of funding to HIV programmes is a source for concern and could deal a deadly blow to the fight against HIV and Aids. \nHowever, Prof Orago has asked the civil groups not to panic since there is about Sh85 billion from the Global Fund targeted for the next four years.\nThough not unexpected, last week US President Barack Obama in his proposed budget for next year cut HIV funding to Kenya from Sh4.1 billion ($499 million) in the 2011 financial year to Sh2.2 billion ($277 million) in 2013. (READ: Obama reduces Aids funds in 2013 budget)\nPresident Obama\u2019s budget is based on a joint Kenya/US Global Health Initiative 2011-2014 launched last year and centred on integrating HIV with other routine medical conditions. \n\u201cThis robbing Peter to pay Paul in the Aids fight is likely to leave both Peter and Paul dead without access to life-saving services,\u201d said Matthew Kavanagh, Director of US Advocacy for Health GAP in a statement to newsrooms.\n\u201cWe\u2019re shifting our focus from solving problems, one at a time, to serving people, by considering more fully the circumstances of their lives,\u201d Secretary of State Hillary Clinton says of the new policy.\nIn favour of the integrated approach in October, the UK Department for International Development said that beginning this year, it would phase out part of its support to HIV programmes in Kenya.\nJustifying this shift at an international meeting in Senegal last December, Mr Stephen O\u2019Brien, the UK Parliamentary Undersecretary of State, said HIV has since stabilised while the price of medicines had gone down considerably.\nDefending President Obama\u2019s action last week, the US global Aids Coordinator Mr Eric Goosby in a State Department blog posting, said there were now cheaper medicines and a local pool of medical personnel who can take the fight against the scourge to the next level.\nMs Kibuchi says it is not yet time to wean HIV programmes because this remains a major killer in the country and hence needs special attention. \n\u201cFor example, the current public health system is prone to drug stock-outs \u2014 a condition you can\u2019t expose HIV patients to. Not yet.\u201d \nBoth the US and Britain argue that they have not abandoned the war against HIV and Aids on the global scene with substantial funding being directed to multilateral donors such as the Global "}
