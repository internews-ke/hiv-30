{"text": "STUDY I Women can fight multiple strains\nFindings offer\nhope in search\nfor HIV vaccine\nTwo prostitutes\nwith superior ability\nto fight the virus\nhave been identified\nin Mombasa\nBY GATONYE GATHURA\ngathura@ke.nationmedia.com\nLocal women may still hold the key to the development of the elusive HIVvaccine after two\nprostitutes with superior ability\nto fight the virus were identified\nin Mombasa.\nThe women in a five-year\nstudy, which involved 12\nprostitutes, have the ability\nto fight multiple HIV strains\nfrom infecting new cells in\ntheir bodies.\nMultiple infections - called\n\"superinfections\"-occur when\nan individual who already has\nHIV is infected with yet another\nstrain of the virus.\nAccording to Prof Walter\nJaoko of the University of\nNairobi and a team of US\nresearchers, the women had\na higher ability to fight off\nthe virus.\nThey had been infected with\ntwo different strains of HIV by\ntwo different men.\nSignificant protection\nThe study goes back to 1998\nwhen a few prostitutes in Nairobi's\nMajengo slums were\nfound to be \"resistant\" to HIV.\nThis formed the basis for the\ndevelopment of the first HIV\nvaccine that was conducted by\nresearchers from the University\nof Nairobi and Oxford University\nin the UK.\nThis vaccine was, however,\nabandoned after it failed to\noffer significant protection.\nBut the researchers did not\ngive up. According to Prof\nJaoko, they went back to the\ndrawing board and by 2008\nthey had identified a woman\nin Mombasa with a HIV strain\nthat was easily stopped by the\nbody's defence system.\nAlthough most people\ninfected with HIV produce\nantibodies within weeks of\ninfection, he explains, these\nantibodies rarely prevent the\ninfection from progressing\nto Aids.\nDuring the same period, a\n20\u00b7year study of a group of\n140 prostitutes in Punwani,\nNairobi, by the universities\nof Nairobi and Manitoba,\nCanada, showed that the\nwomen appeared resistant to\nHIV infection.\nAccording to Dr Joshua Kimani of the Nairobi-Manitoba\nstudy, and who are also running\nmedical clinics for prostitutes\nwithin the Nairobi city centre,\nall this knowledge is crucial in\nthe development of a vaccine.\nThe current study says: 'We\nfound that women who had\nbeen infected twice not only \u2022\nhad more potent antibody\nresponses, but some of these\nwomen had an 'elite' antibody\nthat neutralised a variety of\nstrains of HIV, said senior\nauthor Dr Julie Overbaugh,\na member of the Hutchinson\nCentre's Human Biology Division\nin the US.\n1998\nYear some prostitutes in\nthe city's Majengo slums\nwere found to be resist\u00b7\nant to HIV\nHEALTH\nWomen build\nresistance\nThe women in a five-year\nstudy, which involved 12\nprostitutes, have the ability\nto fight multiple HIV strains\nfrom infecting new cells in\ntheir bodies.\nMultiple infections\n- called \"superinfectlons\"\n- occur when an individ\u00b7\nual who already has HIV is\nInfected with yet another\nstrain of the virus."}
