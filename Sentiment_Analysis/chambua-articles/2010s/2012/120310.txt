{"text": "FAIR PLAY I Peter Mwaura\nWe will gain more by decriminalising\nprostitution.than by labelling it a vice\nFILE I NATION\nProstitutes being arrested by police during a night raid on various social\njoints in Kisumu town last year. Prostitution sustains many people, including\nchildren. It should be publicly recognised by decriminalising it.\nThe law on prostitution\nis confusing and contradictory.\nAlthough\nprostitution itself is not illegal,\nsections 153-156 of the Penal\nCode creates three separate\noffences associated with\nprostitution -living on the\nearnings of prostitution, soliciting,\npimping and running a\nbrothel.\nIt is a crime, for example,\nfor a man, but not for a\nwoman, to solicit for sex in\na public place. Yet to solicit\nin privacy, or get a prostitute\nwithout soliciting, is not a\ncrime.\nIt is a crime, for both men\nand women, to live wholly\nor partly on the earnings of\nprostitution. But when prostitutes\nare fined for the crime,\nin the full knowledge of the\nauthorities that they will pay\nthe fines from the earnings of\nprostitution, no contradictions\nare seen.\nAnd if you turn over the\nearnings to a charity, or\nrelatives - no matter how\nimprobable that seems - it\nwould not be a crime.\nIt is a crime to keep or\nmanage or assist in the management\nof a brothel, or\nknowingly permit premises\nto be used as a brothel. But\nit is not a crime to entertain\na prostitute in a brothel, in a\nhotel room, or in the privacy\nof your home.\nPrivate, consenting adult sex\nis not a crime, as we all know.\nBut it becomes a crime, Le.\nprostitution, if money changes\nhands. But why should\nmoney, freely given, make it a\ncrime?\nIt is not clear what the law is\ntrying to do, or what mischief\nit is trying to cure. Is it trying\nto punish immorality, or to\ndiscourage- a business?\nNor is it clear who the law\nis trying to save, or help. What\nis clear is that criminalising\nprostitution turns a largely victim-\nless crime into a crime in\nwhich women become victims\nof law enforcement officials\nand makes it more difficult to\naddress the serious problems\nassociated with prostitution,\nsuch as the spread of sexually\ntransmitted diseases including\nHIV and Aids.\nBy criminalising prostitution,\nthe law exposes women\nto harassment and persecution\nfor acts which, largely, harm\nno one, and women in general\nare demeaned in the process.\nWould it not be better for\nsociety to decriminalise prostitution\nand use the resources\nspent rounding up prostitutes\nto fight real crime, such as\nbreaking into people's cars?\nDecriminalising prostitution\nwould make women safer and\nfree up the time for the police\nand Nairobi City Council askaris\nto fight real crime.\nProstitution, in any case,\nis an important industry in a\ncapitalist society. It sustains\nmany people, including children.\nIt should be publicly\nrecognised by decriminalising\nit.\nMoreover decrimalising  prostitution would make\nKenya compliant to the UN\nConvention on the Elimination\nof All Forms of Discrimination\nAgainst Women (CEDAW),\nratified on March 9. 1984 and\nis now part of Kenya laws.\nArticle 11 upholds \"the right to\nfree choice of profession and\nemployment\". The CEDAW\ncommittee, which watches\nover the progress made in\nmember countries, has called\nfor the decriminalisation of\nprostitution.\nBesides, our law on prostitution\nis based on what was\nbrought to our shores by the\nEnglish at the dawn of the\n20th century. But England\nhas moved on to decriminalise\nit. In the UK, it is no longer\nillegal to receive money for\nsex, though some forms of\nsoliciting, pimping and brothel\nkeeping are still outlawed.\nAnd in 1954, England set\nup a committee to make a\ncomprehensive review of the\nlaws on prostitution. The\nWolfenden Report, named\nafter committee chair Sir John\nWolfenden, published in 1957,\nconcluded that private morality\nor immorality should not\nbe the law's business.\n\"The law's function is to\npreserve public order and decency,\nto protect the citizen\nfrom what is offensive or injurious,\nand to provide sufficient\nsafeguards against exploitation\nand corruption of others,\" the\nreport said. \"It is not, in our\nview, the function of the law\nto intervene in the private life\nof citizens, or to seek to enforce\nany particular pattern of\nbehaviour:' That is something\nworth thinking about.\ngigirimwaura@yahoo.com"}
