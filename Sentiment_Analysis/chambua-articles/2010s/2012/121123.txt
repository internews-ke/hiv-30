{"text": "Kenya wins big in war on HIV\nHEALTH | Agency boss says there has been limited progress in scaling up male circumcision\nBY EDITH FORTUNATE\nefortunate@ke.nationmedia.com\nKenya is among the six African\ncountries that have recorded a\nsharp drop in new HIV infections\namong children, a global report\nreleased ahead of the World Aids Day\nshows. The number of children newly\ninfected with HIV has decreased by 40\nper cent in the last two years between\n2009 and 2011.\nThe report by the Joint United\nNations Programme on HIV/Aids\n(Unaids) hails Burundi, Kenya, Namibia,\nSouth Africa, Togo and Zambia\nas countries where most progress has\nbeen made in reducing new HIV infections\nin children. While releasing\nthe report yesterday, Unaids executive\ndirector Michel Sidibe said half\nof the global reductions in new HIV\ninfections in the last two years have\nbeen among newborn children.\n\u201cIt is becoming evident that\nachieving zero new HIV infections\nin children is possible, I am excited\nthat far fewer babies are being born\nwith HIV. We are moving from despair\nto hope,\u201d he said.\nThe report indicates that antiretroviral\ntherapy is a powerful force for\nsaving lives. In the last 24 months\nthe number of people accessing\ntreatment has increased by 63 percent\nglobally.\nIn sub-Saharan Africa, a record 2.3\nmillion people had access to ARVs;\nthey were more than half a million\nfewer deaths in 2011 than in 2005. The\nlargest drop in AIDS-related deaths\nis being seen in countries where HIV\nprevalence is relatively high. Kenya\nhad 71,000 fewer deaths, South Africa\n100,000, Zimbabwe nearly 90,000,\nand Ethiopia 48,000.\nThe agency noted that there has\nbeen a 13 per cent decline in TB-related\nAIDS deaths for the last two\nyears. \u201cThis accomplishment is due\nto record numbers of people accessing\nantiretroviral treatment, who\nhave increased by 45 per cent,\u201d the\nreport says.\n\u201cMale circumcision has been\nshown to reduce the risk of HIV\ninfection. However, there\u2019s been\nlimited progress in scaling up voluntary\nmedical male circumcision,\u201d\nthe report further adds.\nDespite the gains, Unaids notes\nthat there is an urgent need to improve\nHIV treatment retention rates;\nreduce the cost of second- and thirdline\ntreatment; and explore new ways\nof expanding and sustaining access\nto treatment, including domestic production\nof medicines and innovative\nfinancing.\n\u201cDespite the progress in stopping\nnew infections, the total number\nremains high at 2.5 million in 2011,\u201d\nsays the report."}
