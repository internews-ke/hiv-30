{"text": "AIDS prevention drives new. ways to make the 'cut' easier\nWith the ongoing mass drives to have men in sub-5aharan Africa\nCircumcised to reduce HIV Infection rates, a number of devices to make the\nprocess easier and faster are being tested\n\nNow that three studies have\nshown that circumcising\nadult heterosexual men is\none of the most effective \"vaccines\"\nagainst AIDS - reducing the chances\nof infection by 60 percent or more public\nhealth experts are struggling to\nfind ways to make the process faster,\ncheaper and safer. Circumcision is\nbelieved to protect heterosexual men\nbecause the foreskin has many Langerhans\ncells, which pick up viruses\nand \"present\" them to the immune\nsystem, which HIV attacks.\nThe goal is to circumcise 20\nmillion African men by 2015, but\nonly about 600,000 have had the\noperation thus far. Even a skilled\nsurgeon takes about 15 minutes,\nmost African countries are desperately\nshort of surgeons, and there\nis no Mohels Without Borders. So\ndonors are pinning their hopes on\nseveral devices now being tested to\nspeed things up.\nDr Stefano Bertozzi, director of\nHIV for the Bill and Melinda Gates\nFoundation, said it had its eyes on\ntwo devices, named prePex and the\nShang Ring, and was supporting\nefforts by the World Health Organisation\nto evaluate them. PrePex,\ninvented in 2009 by four Israelis after\none of them, a urologist, heard an appeal\nfor doctors to do circumcisions\nin Africa, was approved by the Food\nand Drug Administration three weeks\nago. And WHO will make a decision\non it soon, said Mitchell Warren, an\nAIDS-prevention expert who closely\nfollows the process.\nFrom the initial safety studies\ndone so far, PrePex is clearly faster,\nless painful and more bloodless than\nany of its current rivals. And it relies\non the simplest and least-threatening\ntechnology - a rubber band.\nThe band compresses the foreskin\nagainst a plastic ring slipped inside\nit; the foreskin dies, within hours\nfor lack of blood and, after a week,\nfalls off or can be clipped off \"like\na fingernail:' said Tzameret Fuerst,\nthe company's chief executive officer,\nwho compared the process\nto the stump of an umbilical cord's\nshrivelling up and dropping off a few\ndays after it is clamped. It is done\nwith topical anaesthetic cream, and\nthere is usually no bleeding.\nPrepex can be put in place and\nremoved by nurses with about three\ndays' training. The rings come in five\nsizes, Athrough E, Fuerst said, \"and\nyou won't believe how high-tech the\nrubber band is:' Each size must apply\njust enough pressure to cut off blood\nflow without being tight enough to\ncause pain.\nWHO, Warren said, is also evaluating\nthe Shang Ring, a plastic two,ring\nclamp developed in China to treat\nconditions in which the foreskin\nbecomes so tight that it cuts off urination.\nHowever, it requires cutting\noff the excess foreskin beyond-the\nclamp, which means the circumciser\nmust inject anaesthetics directly into\nthe penis and groin, wait for them to\ntake effect, create a sterile surgical\nfield and be trained in minor surgery.\n\"The Shang is not as fast, but it's\nfaster than full-fledged surgery;' Warren\nsaid. \"And it hasn't submitted as\nmuch safety data.\"\nIn a safety study presented at\nan AIDS conference last month,\nscientists from Rwanda's health\nministry said they had used PrePex\nto circumcise 590 men. Only two had\n\"moderate\" complications; one was\nfixed with a single suture, and one\nrequired a new band in a different\nspot. According to Dr Jason Reed,\nan epidemiologist in the global\nAIDS division of the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention,\ntwo of 590, or 0.34 per cent, is a\ntenth the typical complication rate\nof surgical circumcision. None of the men\nbecame infected.\nOn the l0-point pain scale, they reported\non average only about 1when the ring was\nplaced and only 3 when it was removed\n(about the same level of pain caused by\nerections during the week they wore it). By\nthe end of the study, the two-nurse teams\ncould do a procedure in three minutes. By\nContrast: Reed said the best surgical assemblies  - a practice being pioneered\nin with US taxpayer support - can\nget down to seven minutes per patient but\nonly by getting six nurses and a surgeon\nto a tight harmony.\nIn theory, he said, breaking that into\ntwo-nurse PrePex teams could mean\nCircumcising around 400 men a day rather\nthan the 60 to 80 a busy team now does. And\nthe surgeon could be freed to go do something\nmore important. In fact, Reed said\nUS AIDS dollars for circumcisions often~\ngo towards an operating room with lights\nand an instrument steriliser. And instead\nof circumcisions, hospitals are more likely\nto use it for procedures like saving women\nin obstructed labour.\nRobery Bailey, an epidemiologist at the\nUruyerslty of Illinois in Chicago, who helped\nKenya\u2019s circumcision efforts, opposes\nThe time saving devices because training nurses\nIn minor surgery has other benefits he\nsaid. A trained nurse could close a wound\nor take out an appendix, for example. And\nthe time-consuming parts of the process\nare counselling and HIV testing, Bailey\nsaid, so \u201cdoing it in five minutes instead\nof 20 is trivial\u201d\nBut, he conceded, \"If PrePex really\nDoesn\u2019t require anaesthesia, that's truly\nan advance.\"\nOther, riyal devices are not far along in\nsafety testing or are failing it. The Tara\nKLamp, manufactured in Malaysia since the\ni990s, for example, has created controversy\nin South Africa. It is a hinged plastic bracket\nthe size of a small drinking cup. A plastic\ntube goes over the head of the penis and\nthe foreskin is pulled up it and painfully\ncrushed by the bracket. Then the whole\ncontraption must be worn for at least five\ndays. A 2005 clinical trial in South Africa\nwas stopped early after the device caused\nfar more injuries and infections than surgery\ndid. The national health ministry has banned\nIt most of South Africa, but it is still used\nheavily m KwaZulu-Natal province, which\nhas the country's highest AIDS rate and\nwhere the Zulu king, Goodwill Zwelithini,\nreversig 200 years of tradition, ordered\nall Zulu men circumcised.\nReed said he had heard that another device,\nAli s Klamp, was being tested in Kenya under protocols that seemed to match WHO\nrequirements. According to Circlist.com, a\ncircumcision information website, it is a\nTurkish device dating back to 2007, and\nworks on principles similar to those of the\nTara KLamp and another FDA approved\ndevice, the SmartKlamp.\nPrepex's ultimate cost is still being negotiated\nWith donor agencies and foundations\nFuerst said, but may end up in the $15 to $20\nrange (Shl,275 to Sh 1,700), about the same\nas a surgical circumcision kit.
