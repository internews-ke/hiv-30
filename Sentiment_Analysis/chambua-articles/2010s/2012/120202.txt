{"text": "February 2,\u00a02012\nHe gave me the virus, I revenged on womanisers, but that was then \nBecause in our country, and on our continent, HIV has pervaded the most intimate moments in peoples\u2019 relationships, it has burrowed itself deep into the very soul of our most unmentionable of taboos \u2014 sex.\nIt has held us hostage through our own silence and our burning shame. And most strangely, in a country and a continent divided by many things, it has united us, in the deaths of our parents, our brothers and sisters, our friends. \nEven our enemies. But amid the pain that HIV/Aids has caused, are threads of hope \u2014 that one day there will be a generation that doesn\u2019t know how to describe HIV, because they don\u2019t have to experience it.\nThis is a story of that hope and the audacity of those, infected and affected, who have remained unbowed by the enormity of the task of finding a cure for HIV/Aids.\nIn the middle of the ever growing grey rows of apartment blocks in Mwiki, east of the city centre of Nairobi, Evelyn Nyambura Simaloi, and her seven-year-old son Emmanuel are preparing to go on a journey, one that they hope will change both their lives.\nSimaloi, especially, has hoped that this day will come for almost all of her adult life.\n\u201cIt was about two years after I had finished high school; my step-mum had kicked me out for stealing a plate of chips. \n\u201cSo I met a guy who became my boyfriend and took me in. One day, I was looking for a job and they required that I take a HIV test. \n\u201cAround the same time, my boyfriend fell very sick and was admitted at Kenyatta National Hospital Ward 7D. I\u2019ll never forget that ward. Then he later told me that he knew he was HIV-positive. I was really shocked,\u201d she recalls. \nThe news of her status was a blow she just wasn\u2019t prepared to take. To this day, she still has a photo of the man who infected her with the virus. \nAt just 21 years of age, Simaloi felt the cruel irony of contracting a disease she thought would kill her just as she was about to begin life as an adult.\nThis, to her, was yet another dark twist in the tough life she had already endured. When Simaloi was an infant, her father, then, an airforce pilot, and her mother, separated. \nEsther Wanjiku, Simaloi\u2019s paternal auntie says: \u201cMe and Simaloi had a special bond. I felt very sad, especially for her, although I didn\u2019t fully understand why they were separating.\u201d \nSimaloi found herself in the homes of step-parents whom, she says, saw her as a burden \u2014 as a baggage from past relationships.\nAfter they discovered her status, her family was the last place she was going to look for support. Desperate, bitter, and in denial, Simaloi told herself that she wouldn\u2019t die alone.\n\u201cI used to have multiple sexual partners,\u201d she told the radio station QFM. It became more than promiscuity for Simaloi. \nShe turned to commercial sex work to support herself, and try to soothe the bitterness that she felt for having contracted HIV.\nFor three years, Simaloi partied, drank, and had sex with many men. \u201cI used to look for womanisers \u2014 men who like women. I was young and attractive. \n\u201cWhen men would see me on the dance floor, they would come running. I would always propose a condom, but some would refuse and I would say \u2018fine, have it.\u2019\u201d But all that changed one night in 2002. \n\u201cI was coming from a chang\u2019aa den at like 3 am. A man who had wanted me followed me, and raped me. I conceived,\u201d she says.\nSimaloi decided to turn her life around after discovering that her rape ordeal had left her pregnant. She became a Christian, stopped drinking, and reconnected with some members of her family.\nNine months later, Emmanuel was born; spinning her rape ordeal into what she says is the biggest blessing she has ever received.\nBut even Emmanuel, or Manu as she likes to call him, wouldn\u2019t escape her past. \u201cMy son is a blessing. He has the virus, and that is one thing I regret. I gave him the disease through breast-feeding.\n\u201cHe gets really sick two or three times a year and I panic, but whenever we celebrate his birthday, I thank God because I never thought we would go this far,\u201d says Simaloi. \nManu had a positive impact on her as she eventually came to terms with her status. More than that, in her work as a freelance journalist and a peer educator, she found her purpose. \nShe would tell people that HIV is a virus like any other and encourage HIV-positive people to get on anti-retroviral treatment as soon as possible. \nBut in telling people this, Simaloi was secretly fighting her own battle with the disease \u2014 that of getting onto ARVS herself.\n\u201cFor me personally, I don\u2019t want to get onto ARVS. Yes they prolong life but I don\u2019t want them,\u201d she says. In truth, Simaloi didn\u2019t know that HIV was eating away at her.\nSays Dr Nicholas Muraguri of Nascop: \u201cThe period between the time one gets infected and the time the disease manifests itself can be between 8 and 15 to 20 years. \n\u201cThere are three stages of HIV; in the first phase, after two months of infection you develop flu, or you have flu like symptoms.\n\u201cThe next phase is asymptomatic HIV where you don\u2019t have any symptoms. Then there is stage three where opportunistic diseases begin to develop and stage four when you develop full blown Aids.\u201d \nA month before we first met her, Simaloi was admitted in hospital for one month with a severe case of cryptococal meningitis.\nHer son Emmanuel took pictures of her while she was ill. She was advised to start anti-retroviral treatment immediately, before she slipped into stage four of HIV \u2014 full blown Aids. But Simaloi resisted. \n\u201cI eat well, I\u2019m OK even after getting ill,\u201d she says. Simaloi admits that she didn\u2019t want to get onto anti-retroviral treatment, because, apart from the side effects she had seen, it is a life-long treatment, and not an absolute guarantee of recovery from illness, especially for people like her who have already progressed into stage three of HIV.\nARVS are recommended once HIV-positive people\u2019s CD4 count, that is, the number of white blood cells in the body, goes below 500. \nWhen Simaloi was discharged from hospital after recovering from meningitis, her CD4 count was just 107. \nHer attempts to boost the count with vitamin pills were working in fits and starts, but she nursed the hope of finding one set of medication that would leave her healthy for life, without committing to taking it every day. \nThen one day, she heard about medication that promised that. And more. The medicine was made by a man in Molo, in the southern Rift Valley region of Kenya. \nAnd it wasn\u2019t just medication for HIV/Aids management, its maker said that it had the potential to cure her of HIV.\nSo on November 11, 2010, Simaloi, still weak and shaken from her last battle against HIV, set out with her son.\nIronically unshaken by the looming consequences of her decision \u2014 she walked with the support of a crutch, the lingering effect of the meningitis, which at times causes partial paralysis \u2014 but she was also leaning on her faith. \nFaith in a man she had never met, medicine she knew little about, and faith in time, which she knew she may have little of.\nFor most of the drive to Molo, Simaloi sat in silence, reading a brochure that told her about the herbal medicine she was on her way to take.\nIt was a big decision; and having lived with HIV for 11 years, she knew that there were many herbalists who had claimed to have the answer to HIV \u2014 many of which she has tried before. This time around though, she was confident. \n\u201cI don\u2019t know why, but this one is different,\u201d she says. In pursuit of her story, we all arrive in Molo town, a small outpost of the large breadbasket that is the Rift Valley. \nA beautiful landscape from which, like in many other places in Kenya, the cries of people who have lost loved ones to HIV, have echoed.\nBut there too have been whispers of a man trying to turn this tide of tears back. A son of the soil with a remedy that people say has worked wonders for the health of many who were staring death in the face.\nSixty-year-old-David Mwangi is that man. And as he comes out to meet Simaloi and Manu, he looks like a man who, if all the rumours about him were to go by, cloaked this mystique well under his unassuming appearance. \nBut once inside, his faith, and his convictions are very clear. After Simaloi tells David how she and Manu contracted HIV, David begins what he calls a counselling session, heavy laden with biblical references. \n\u201cI believe anybody has the capacity for everything. Nebuchadnezzar was used to destroy the Middle East. To believe you must cleanse yourself of all of these other beliefs,\u201d he says.\n\u201cYou have to believe that this works.\u201d A lot of what David tells Simaloi on this day is about her own belief that his medicine can work. \nBecause he doesn\u2019t profess to have any specialised knowledge as a doctor or as a traditional healer, we ask David on a different occasion how he came about this medicine. \nThe one area he says he does have experience in, belief, and faith, gives us the answer. \u201cThere is something inside called a guiding spirit,\u201d he says.\nDavid then goes on to explain to Simaloi what his medicine is. \u201cWhat we are going to do is that we are going to kill the virus. One thing is that you will start to feel changes in 10 days. \n\u201cIn 15 days\u2019 time people will start to notice. My medicine will do its work. You will have to attend to other things like eating right.\u201d\nBut having heard advise like this before, an attentive Simaloi has some questions. \u201cAre you saying that this will kill the virus completely?\u201d she asks whereupon David explains: \n\u201cWhen you see people who have lived for six years without using ARVS coming back to help, what do you say? We are coming from old wineskins to new wineskins.\u201d He explains. \nAfter what has been 30 minutes of a back and forth between David and Simaloi, he goes to get his medicine. \nHis medicine, which he calls poochmed, is extracted mostly from plants and natural products but he won\u2019t tell us what it\u2019s made of.\nSimaloi though seems happy with the discussion. \u201cI\u2019m still very positive. Usually I walk into a place but today I have got no nagging feeling about this,\u201d she says.\nMinutes later, poochmed, David\u2019s medicine is brought out. Simaloi and Manu have their first taste. David insists on their taking more water than usual to help the medicine in its effectiveness. \nThis first dose will last Simaloi and Manu two weeks, after which they will need to come back and get a second dose.\nDavid also wants them to return so that he can monitor their progress, and chat with Simaloi, who he feels still has misgivings about the medicine; especially whether it will or won\u2019t cure her of HIV.\nA week later Simaloi and Manu are on their way to their regular clinic near their home and Simaloi says she\u2019s feeling a big change in her since she began taking poochmed. \nManu, however, reacted to the medication badly and had diarhorrea for three days. \u201cNow I have to take half dose\u201d.\nAt the clinic, Simaloi decided to take a HIV test. Even though she knew her status, she thought it was a good opportunity to get the message out there that knowing your status is half the battle won. \nShe was also feeling very optimistic about poochmed. \u201cI am positive, definitely positive,\u201d she says.\nIn most hospitals that run HIV clinics, once a person tests positive for HIV, the next step is to get their CD4 count taken. Because she\u2019s been feeling better, Simaloi decides to check her count. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not good,\u201d she says. The doctors here shepherd her to the drugs counter to ensure that she takes her dose of ARVS. \nBut as we go back to her home, Simaloi begins to regain her confidence in poochmed. \u201cI have seen drastic changes,\u201d she says. \nThe effects of her bout of meningitis seem to have worn off, but this is where most doctors claim that herbal medicine can be at best confusing, and at worst, disastrous for someone\u2019s health.\nProf Omu Anzala is the director of the Kenya Aids Vaccine Initiative. He\u2019s been at the forefront of the search for a Kenyan developed aids vaccine.\n\u201cWith proper science we diagnose and give treatment for HIV as well as for opportunistic diseases. With herbs you don\u2019t know what is being treated,\u201d says the professor.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that there is any herbal concoction that has proved efficacious against the disease,\u201d says Dr Muraguri. \nEven David himself knows that his chances at being taken seriously as a researcher that may have stumbled onto what could be the biggest medical triumph of this generation are slim.\n\u201cThe biggest drawback with Africans is that if something does not come from the West we consider it primitive, backward. It has to come from over there so we can take it,\u201d he protests.\n------------------------\u2028In our company, Simaloi and Manu are back in Molo to see David for their second dose of poochmed. Mother and son claim that their health has vastly improved. \nThe molluscum \u2014 the black pimples on her face, seem to have faded since the last time we saw her, and so outwardly at least, something seems to be happening. \nBut Simaloi still has questions about the efficacy of David\u2019s drug. \u201cI\u2019ve always feared to ask this: Will I turn negative, what am I expecting?\u201d she asks. \nThere seems to be confusion about whether David\u2019s medicine cures or manages HIV, so I jump in to ask what exactly David believes the medicine does. He obliges.\n\u201cThere has been no medicine that can isolate the virus within the CD4 and kill it,\u201d he says. When we ask him if that is what the medicine does he replies in the affirmative.\n\u201cAfter the medicine does its work, you will test negative but if you go for another test you will test positive. \nFor instance there is a lawyer; a lady who says she tests negative but when she goes for, I don\u2019t know what, virology, she tests positive,\u201d says David.\nDavid also claims to have given his medicine to nearly one hundred people like the lawyer he has just described. We ask to contact them, but he is hesitant. \nHe claims that none of his former patients ever wants to be associated with the disease \u2014 or with him after they\u2019ve been healed.\nIt takes us months to convince him to let us interview one of his \u201cpatients\u201d. On our third visit to Molo, he introduces us to a friend and a neighbour of his whom he says took poochmed. He is the 30-year-old John Hamisi Hanga. \nJohn Hamisi looks frail, the effects of what he says was his brush with death, after contracting tuberculosis late in 2010.\nTuberculosis is one of the more common and deadly opportunistic diseases that affect HIV positive people who have progressed to stage three of the virus. \nHanga though, claims that he\u2019s doing much better than he was in January 2011, when he was given anti-retrovirals after his diagnosis. \n\u201cThe drugs reacted badly on me so I took them back to the doctor who said I had no alternative but to use them. But then I happened to meet this man David.\u201d\nadvertisement "}
