{"text": "May 1,\u00a02012\nStealing funds to contain Aids and malaria a crime against humanity\nThe Rome Statute refers to crimes against humanity as those odious deeds that constitute a repugnant attack on human dignity or grave humiliation or degradation of one or more human beings.\nThe question then arises: Hasn\u2019t corruption been a serious attack on human dignity? Haven\u2019t many Kenyans been subject of humiliation by corrupt practices?\nThe Rome Statute that establishes the ICC further views such crimes against humanity as those which are part either of a government policy (although the perpetrators need not identify themselves with this policy) or a wide practice of atrocities tolerated or condoned by a government or a de facto authority. \nCorruption fits this bill.\nThe magnitude, prevalence and systematic nature of corruption in Africa has caused untold misery, suffering and deaths of many; it\u2019s actually a crime against humanity.\nDreams have been shattered, careers ended, communities marginalised and businesses shut down due to corruption. Endemic theft of public resources in Kenya in particular has been sickening. \nNow even before Kenyans recover from the shock of the scam at the National Housing Corporation regarding the misallocation of low cost housing, another graft has surfaced. \nThe recent audit report revealing how money donated by the Global Fund meant to fight HIV, malaria and tuberculosis has been misappropriated over the years adds to the ever rising number of graft cases in Kenya. \nThese funds were meant to address the plight of the poor, many of whom ended up suffering while the real \u201cbeneficiaries\u201d expanded their economic empires. \nGreedy and corrupt individuals stop at nothing in their quest to amass more and more without caring about the plight of the sick. \nWhen deaths of the disadvantaged occur as a result of corrupt practices, isn\u2019t that a crime against humanity? \nHow can \u201csane\u201d public servants even think of stealing money from the dying? Have we become such heartless brutes? What is our society coming to?\nMere restitution by those who have been stealing Global Fund cash is not good enough. \nDAVID SONYE, \nRarieda\n-------------\nNo prosecution\nThe \u201crape\u201d of the Global Fund shows that civil servants, just like their political masters, steal from the most needy to line already bulging pockets.\nWhat most amazes is the statement that, some within the division of malaria control have returned the stolen money. \nThere\u2019s no mention of prosecution for theft. Are the DPP and AG aware of this?\nANTHONY GITTENS, \nKilifi"}
