{"text": "September 24,\u00a02012\nARVs in brews? Blame the govt\nBy CLAY MUGANDA\nWhenever I watch an HIV- and Aids-related news item on local TV, I cringe. But when a Government of Kenya-sponsored HIV and Aids awareness advertisement is being aired, I blench and wonder why that money was not utilised in a programme from which people living with HIV and Aids could benefit directly.\nThere are far too many government-related bodies all engaged in this big fight against HIV and Aids, and that should be a good thing. But, ironically, it isn\u2019t.\nMany a time, the awareness messages they want to convey pass through so many internal hands that, by the time they are released to the assumed target audience, they have lost their verve, are muffled and only help in the spreading of ignorance.\nAs a matter of fact, no institutions exhibit ignorance about HIV and Aids more than GoK-related bodies, which have continued to treat campaigns against HIV and Aids as a seasonal activity which peaks on World HIV and Aids Day on December 1 and takes a rest for the rest of the year.\nAs the day approaches, Kenyans are bombarded with HIV-prevalence figures for different parts of the country, and of different demographics, but during the other months, figures related to HIV and Aids only come in the form of money \u2014 the amount that was unutilised, lost or how Kenya will not receive the next tranche from the Global Fund to fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria because it never utilised its previous allocation.\nWanton wastage\nWhen these figures of wanton wastage or underutilisation come to light, panic reigns supreme at Afya House, Office of the President and at all those numerous GoK bodies for a moment, after which press conferences are hastily called and we are treated to an all-too-familiar rigmarole of accusations, counter-accusations and denials.\nInvariably, it is an opportunity for chest-thumping, with fears being allayed that all is well and Kenya has enough resources to not only tackle new and existing infections, but also conduct awareness campaigns for several years without receiving any new funding.\nHowever, what we see and experience are totally different from what we are told, and go on to prove that many things are wrong or totally amiss with GoK\u2019s approach and strategy in the fight against HIV and Aids.\nThe case that best exemplifies GoK\u2019s lackadaisical approach and miserable strategy in this fight is the one whereby anti-retroviral drugs from GoK-licensed clinics are used in the preparation of moonshine in Nairobi\u2019s informal settlements.\nOf course the hooch is sold to people living with HIV and Aids, the affected and many others across the city, and while it might be too easy to blame the people living with the disease for procuring the life-prolonging drugs then selling them to the distillers, it is GoK \u2014 through its numerous bodies \u2014 that should bear the blame because that is proof its much-touted awareness campaigns have come a cropper.\nIt all boils down to education, and what we watched in that NTV expos\u00e9 was due to lack of education on the part of the people living with HIV and Aids who sell their medication.\nMost of them were skipping their dosages, something they should not be doing if at all they were well-educated on the importance of not failing to take their medication or that skipping even a single dose only increases their resistance and compromises their immunity.\nThe sad bit about GoK\u2019s poor management of information in the fight against HIV and Aids was exhibited by those people living with HIV and Aids who had registered at numerous clinics which they visited on different days to collect drugs.\nThis they do not do so that they can take double doses or remain with some medication to take after giving the distillers their shares, but because they want a big \u201cconsignment\u201d to sell.\nInformation management\nYou do not have to be a rocket scientist to know that multiple registrations in different clinics can be stemmed by installing information-management systems and maintaining good record-keeping procedures.\nFrom the foregoing, it is clear that the Health ministry and other GoK-related bodies lack vetting systems. This is why it is possible for some people living with HIV and Aids to hop from one clinic to another and collect ARVs without being detected.\nIdeally, in this time and age, and for such a condition like HIV and Aids that is costly to manage and also sensitive, GoK should have networked clinics.\nIt should have also compiled a database of people living with HIV and Aids on medication so their progress could be monitored and make it easier for them to receive proper medical help in any (HIV and Aids) clinic across the country.\nSuch a database would definitely help in identifying those who have registered for medication in more than one clinic. Consequently, it would lead to better management of the elusive ARVs and increase access to the hundreds of thousands who are in dire need of them \u2014 if you consider the fact that out of the 1.2 million odd people living with HIV and Aids, only 540,000 are on (free) medication.\nWithout such a database, can the government really purport to know the number of those on medication or those in need of the same? Is it possible for it to monitor the people living with HIV and Aids who are already on medication and know whether their health is improving or not? Can the government really keep track of those who are on the wrong medication or those who need to migrate to second or third line of drugs? Hardly.\nOftentimes, the public suffers because of lack of (access to) information since GoK more often than not contravenes Article 35 of the Constitution of Kenya that guarantees every citizen the right to information.\nHowever, in this case, GoK is the victim of its own haplessness and has failed to have in place proper systems that it can employ in collecting and processing information which it can use to improve the lives of Kenyans in general and people living with HIV and Aids in particular.\nOf course lack of (access to) information leads to, or means unmitigated ignorance, and GoK clearly demonstrates that when it comes to people living with HIV and Aids, it is not just at sea, but lacks the will, the wherewithal and the capacity to come up with proper policies to educate and protect them.\nIn a sentence, GoK is fully responsible for what is happening in those informal settlements where ARVs are a major ingredient in illicit brews.\n*****************\nNeeded: A commission to define what is a \u2018crisis\u2019\nFor several months, many idle Kenyans have been accusing the Head of State, who also doubles up as the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Kenya, of being lethargic, what with riots, killings and strikes all over the country.\nThese louts must be under hypnosis or are suffering from amnesia, selective or State-sanctioned, for no one is as active as President Kibaki, who wastes no time in dousing ethnic fires, cooling tempers and bringing things under control.\nHe is not your ordinary Nero who fiddles as unpatriotic people set the country aflame \u2014 he cannot afford (considering the state of the economy, it is very expensive, you know) to be laid back since managing Kenya is the hardest job on Planet Earth; harder than shepherding 40 million animals, all thinking differently and others not thinking at all, especially those who are more equal than others.\nPresident Kibaki\u2019s job description does not permit him to sit back \u2014 in State House or in traffic gridlocks \u2014 as the country goes to the stray mongrels and other wild animals.\nHis fingers must be in every pie and he has to ensure that all the little sods get their fair desserts, mostly the crumbs from the national cake whose slices are served to the few who have been given the seats closest to the baker.\nThe President\u2019s plate is full \u2014 and his kitchen is hot, but he can stand the heat, thus, just when you think he is in the soup, is suffering a burnout or is putting important things in the back burner, he conjures a new menu and whips up something using the same old recipes.\nThe latest to come from the President\u2019s Kitchen Cabinet is a Judicial Commission of Inquiry to investigate the cause of the Tana conflict.\nThat, by all international standards, is wonderful, but he should form a commission which can define CRISIS \u2014 because that is what the country is currently in.\n*****************\nKeep these vultures away from Conjestina\nMany columns ago (on April 7, 2006 and December 8, 2006), after watching how fellow journalists and hopeless, ill-trained and dishonest local boxing promoters were coalescing around Conjestina Achieng, I wrote that the only honest man around her could be her son.\nTo be fair to the journalists, when the chips were down, they gave Conjestina the prop she needed, and it is commendable that people are ensuring she receives assistance, both medical and financial.\nSome local boxing promoters \u2014 who look more like pick-pockets and hood rats \u2014 have not been seen anywhere near her, or heard talking about her current plight.\nWhen she still had some fight in her, these despicable pests were only busy securing opponents without giving her a chance for recovery in between fights or caring that she was overwhelmed.\nApart from exposing the humane side of the oft-disparaged Kenya\u2019s \u201ccelebs\u201d, Conjestina\u2019s case has again proved that GoK \u2014actually, the Sports ministry \u2014 is a hopeless entity whose officials only care about foreign trips.\nShould Conjestina be required to travel abroad for further medical care, you will see a retinue of these hopeless officials shamelessly fight amongst themselves to accompany her.\nAll should be done to keep them away from her, and, above all, she needs security to ward off these greedy, dishonest, ill-trained, mis-educated and illiterate vultures who call themselves Kenya\u2019s boxing promoters."}
