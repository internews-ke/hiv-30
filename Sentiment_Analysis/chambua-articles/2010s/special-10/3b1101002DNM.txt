Those who use tablets
unwilling to speak up
BY SAMUEL BORN MAINA
There has been debate on
whether people who engage in
casual sex should be allowed
to take PREP.
Dr David Bukusi, who heads
the VCT and HIV prevention
unit at KNH, said use of the
drugs was a danger to public
morality.
Those who have abused the
treatment are reluctant to be
identified, for fear of being
stigmatised.
“I did not even know her
name nor do I have her contact,”
said a 28-year-old college
student in Kisumu who said he
had sought the medicine after
he had a sexual encounter with
a stranger who had insisted on
not having safe sex.
He had gone to a disco in
July, got drunk and went home
with the stranger. She did not
even introduce herself.
“That alone made me to
suspect her,” he said. “I had
to do something.”
For 28 days, he took the
medicine religiously and in late
October went for a HIV test.
The results were negative.
Another user, who was not
willing to be named either, said
he had a sexual encounter with
a sex worker.
“I am sure she was (HIV)
positive,” he said. “I had a
choice of reversing the possibility
of having acquired the
HIV virus or living with the
repercussions for the rest of
my life.”
He chose the former and
obtained the drugs. “Now I
have no worry,” he said.
After completing his dose,
he went for a series of tests.
They all turned out negative.
However, the drug is not
without side effects, which
can include nausea, diarrhoea
and weight loss.
