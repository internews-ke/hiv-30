{"text": "Aids horror in city slum village\nOnly a slight tinge of wavering from his voice could have betrayed his inner suffering. But\nhe was otherwise calm and confident, his face was pleasant, perhaps too mature for his\nage His story was as captivating as it was moving.\n\"My parents died in 1990,\" a humble-loo~ Wm:,am Owino ~ '\n\"I am the eldest and there are six other children, he added. m !1 sllDple tone.\nHis 8,u4ie~ce, participants of the~ Aids Orphan Survey Dissemmation Workshop held last\nweek, listened keenly.\nHe went on to tell of the parent-breadwinner\nrole into which fate has thrust him\ndespite his being' unemployed. \"I had to\nleave school but tried to get a job in vain.\"\nTo make ends meet he goes \u00b7to Wakulima\nmarket in the city everyday to buy oranges\nfor sale. He also sells some cigarettes for a\nliving.\n-'At lunch time I have to be home to make\nsome lunch for my siblings.\" he added.\nHis troubles began soon after his parents'\ndeath. The semi-permanent house his father\nhad built in the Kibera slums became a bone\nof contention. An uncle tried to sell it soon\n. after the parents died.\n\u2022. \"My uncle tried to chase us away, but a\n\u2022 chief in Kibera helped us out.\"\nHis uncle's machinations apparently started\nwhile his mother's body was still in the\nmortuary. The mother died a month after\nthe father.\n\"After we buried my mother, he left us in\nthe village in western Kenya with an old\ngrandmother,\" he added.\nBut they had to come back to the city:\nsince the children needed to go back to\nschool.\nAt this time Owino had no idea about the\ncause of his parents' deaths. It was when he\ntook his sickly brother to the doctor who had\nbeen treating them that he learnt what he\nhad least suspected. They had died of Aids.\n\"I just accepted the tragedy and the new\nresponsibility,\" says Owino.\nGood Samaritans have come to his aid\nincluding a Kibera nurse/nutritionist and\ncounsellor, Mrs Florence Ndung'u who goes\nto see them every so often, as well as the\nlocal chief. \"They have been helpful and I\nhave managed to add an extra room to the house that my father built.\"\n. An non-govermental organisation Crisco'\n'Orphans are\nstigmatised\nbecause of .\nwhat their parents'\nhave died of\nUtumishi  kwa Wote (service for all).has provided the  children with school uniform.\nBut the problem is of meeting of the daily.\nneeds of six children (the youngest 18 seven)\nis no doubt far more than he can manage.\n, Owino and his six siblings are some of the\nmany Aids orphans in this country, whose\nplight is beyond description but who may\nnot have anyone to turn to ..\nIndeed unlike in neighbouring countries -\nUganda and parts of Tanzania where Aids is\nknown to have wiped out whole villages leaving\nvarious children desperate - the problem\nin Kenya seems not to have been well registered.\n-., .\nA few surveys being conducted have, however, given chilling indications of the seriousness of the problem ....\nflorence Ndung'u, the nurse/nutritionist and counsellor who has been coordinating\nhealth activities in the Kibera slum, says\nthat at the moment she has been handling 50\nHIV positive mothers in the slum.\n\"So far we have 20 Aids orphans, 13 of\nwhom are being taken care of by their relatives.\nBut Owino and his siblings do not have.\ngood relatives to turn to,\" she says.\n'Florence says that last year, four mothers\nin the slum died of Aids and \"as I speak\ntoday two babies have been found HIV positive\".\nA baseline survey carried out by\nmembers of Kenya Women's Medical\nAssociation in Laini Saba, Kibera,\nrevealed that two out of the 37 patients died\nof Aids while seven others were suspected to\nhave died of the disease because of\ncontracting tuberculosis and other Aids-related\ndisease ,leaving behind 81 orphans.\n\"They may be transported to their rural\nhomes, they may go into the streets or they\nmay be infected with the disease,\" Dr Jane\nMuita, one of the researchers said.\nOthers drop out of school and hardly ever\nreceive health services or counselling.\nOne fifth (or 20 per cent) of these children,\nwere found to be under the care of grand\nparents. ,\nThe survey also found out that some of\nthe relatives taking care of the orphans were\nunemployed or doing some unskilled jobs,\nhence they are unable to adequately take\ncare of the children. '\n\"In some cases where a family had taken\nup orphans, a two bed-roomed house catered\nfor up to 17 members,\" Dr Muita says.'\nBut Aids orphans are also likely to be\nstigmatised because of what their parents\ndied of.\n\"A mother infected with HIV may be\nostracized or rejected by the family; after her\ndeath the stigma may cling to her orphaned\nchildren even if there is no reason to assume\nthat any of them is infected,\" Vincent\nO'reilly, a representative of the Unicef country\noffice told the workshop.\n\"A whole family may. suffer\ndiscrimination.\" -\nHealth Minister Jeremiah Nyagah\nemphasised the danger Aids was posing ~-\ncause of its progreS8ive trend.\nCiting some traditional practices which\nhelp to spread the incurable disease,\n, Mr Nyagah said a traditional practice\nlike that of planting a spear outside a house\nso that the owner of the house (husband) can\ngo elsewhere, was very dangerous.\n\"The Aids orphan is a victim of circumstances\nthat he did not contribute to,\" he\nsaid. .\n\"We must now ,more than ever consider the plight of 'Aids orphans. I am sure\npeople can help one or two more children. It\nmay not be easy, but never-the-Iess It must\nbe done.\", Dr Elizabeth Ngugi, a community h\nexpert, called for serious approach I !e\nproblem. \"We need to intensify programmes\non Aids awareness to diversify \nagainst these victims at the community level\nshe appealed.\nDr Ngugi s nine-year survey on 1,501' Prostitutes\nindicates that 800 orphans have been left behind by 200 prostitutes who have died.\nof Aids over that period.\n\"The grandparents taking care of these- orphans\nmay soon die and these children, , will\nlose a second home, causing another traumatic\nexperience,\" she said.\nThe study was based on prostitutes in\nboth the urban and rural setting.\nA Unicef advisor's estimates on the disease\u2019s\nimpact on children has revealed that\nin the :to worst affected African countries.\nbetween three and five million children will\nbe orphaned by Aids by the year 2001}.\n\"Of, this category, some have suggested that the Kenyan case load of orphans could,\nin five years alone be 300,000,\" adds O'reilly.\nLast year's estimates indicated that 6,319\nKenyans were suffering from the dreaded\ndisease and the reported total cummulative\nfigures of Aids cases in the country since\n1984 stand at 21,475. The latest WHO figures indicate that\nthere will be 30 million HIV -positive\npeople in Africa, in the year 2000. Of\nthese 10 million will be children. There\nare 10 million HIV people at the moment in ,\nthe continent.\nThe traditional family set up which made\nevery member of the society responsible for\n'the other is no longer as functional. This\nposes very specific danger to Aids orphans,\nparticularly those Viho are urbanised.\nBut all said and done, the reality of Aids\norphans will no doubt manifest itself broadly\nin a very progressive manner. And until policies\nare laid out and action taken, the crisis\nmay be unbearable.\nDr Ngugi calls for a quick survey to determine the status of Aids orphans. \"The aftermath will affect the society's economic structure.\nSo should we wait until the problem is\noverwhelming?\" she asks.\nWilliam Owino (standing, right) with his\nbrothers and sisters and a health worker, Mrs\nFlorence Ndungu (seated, second right).\n\"The task of fending for my brothers and\nsisters is. overwhelming.\""}
