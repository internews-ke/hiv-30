{"text": "Isolate all HIV carriers\nMy message on the killer-disease\nAids' should be very clear to those\nwho still have a don't care attitude\ntowards liberal sex.\nThe Government has addressed\nthe issue of high moral'\nstandards and has also created\nawareness on the dangers of sexual\npromiscuity. My major concern\non the issues is the danger\nthe disease. poses to the production capacity of the entire population of this country.\nWe are all aware that we need a\nhealthy population so as to enhance\ndevelopment and improve'\nthe standard of living of our\npeople. We cannot achieve this if\nthe rate at which the disease is\nspreading continues to grow.\nAs a remedy, I do suggest that\nthe Government should undertake\nto control the spread of Aids\nby isolating all victims from the\nhealthy population so that they\ndie peacefully without spreading\nthe disease.\nGive the medical officers mandate\nto carry out a thorough campaign \nand to investigate potential\nHIV carriers so as to avoid\nspread of the disease. The\nGovernment should impose a ban\non prostitution such that any\nwoman found in social places\nwithout a husband should be\nsubjected to the HIV test.\nThe Government should also\nreduce drinking hours by another\n,two hours because the extended time is responsible for the loose sex.\nThe above argument may look\ndictatorial but I should say due to\nnecessity to save mankind,\ntougher measures should be undertaken.\nMaurice Onyango,\nKabarnet"}
