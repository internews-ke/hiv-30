{"text": "FRIDAY, JUNE 5, 1992\n\nTesting HIV positive doesn\u2019t deter women from getting pregnant\n\nBy MALCOLM RITTE\u2028\nPregnant inner-city women in New York who learned they were infected with the Aida virus were not deterred from getting pregnant again and giving birth, despite the risk of infecting their babies, a study found. The result suggests that just testing pregnant women for Aida virus infection, as recommended by some health authorities, may not substantially reduce the number of infected babies born, the researchers said.\u2028\nTo reach that goal, women must be provided with adequate birth control, their sexual partners must be involved in efforts to prevent further births, and \u201cwomen must be helped to find self-fulfillment in areas other than childbearing,\u201d the researchers wrote.\u2028\nThe study also emphasizes the importance of finding ways to prevent mother-to-baby transmission, said co-author Dr Howard Minkoff. \u00a1t also supports Maintaining access to abortion services, he said.\u2028\nHe and colleagues at the state university of New York Health Science centre in Brooklyn present the study in the June issue of the Journal Onset (rifts and Gynecology.\u2028\nThe finding makes sense, said Vickie Maya, a psychologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who studies Mda-related behaviour in women and ethnic minorities.\n\n\u201cWhen you see someone there is 20-to-50 per cent chance of their child being (infected) with the virus, that\u2019s riot horrendous if you think about it,\u201d Maya said. \u201cGiven what the meaning of pregnancy could be, you might decide to take that risk.\u201d\u2028\nA new child may mean more intimacy with a sexual partner or even marriage, or an impetus for leading a better life, she said. In the inner city, a child also may be seen as a chance to raise the family\u2019s status if the baby grow up to be successful, and a source of support for the mother in her inlet years, Mays said. \u2028\nIn addition, many births from infected women in the study probably were not planned, she said. In poorer households, lack of privacy and mismatched working shifts can make it harder to plan sex, and therefore to practice contraception, she said.\u2028\nSexual partners may also object to contraceptives like condoms, she said.\u2028\nThe study involved 206 pregnant. Mostly minority women of low socioeconomic status. They were drawn from an area of Brooklyn with a high rate of infection with the aids virus (HIV) Minkoff said. The women, ail enrolled in prenatal care programmes were offered HW testing and counselling.\u2028\nTesting found that 98 women were HIV.-positive and 108 were uninfected."}
