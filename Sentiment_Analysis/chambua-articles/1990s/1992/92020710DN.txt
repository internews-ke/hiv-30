But as\nfar as most families are concerned\nthe word is taboo.\n\"The subject is totally hushed\nup,\" a churchman said. \"People\nwon't admit it or talk about it.\nIt's whispered at funerals but\nthey generally pretend the cause\n'If death is pneumonia or\nmalaria.\"\nAIDS rampages through Zambia's\nrural as well as urban areas.\nTransmitted almost entirely by\nheterosexual sex, the syndrome is\npopularly known as \"the slow\npuncture disease.\"\nOfficials are deeply concerned,  at the effect on the economy.\nWith funeral expenses climbing,\nabsenteeism increasing and more\nemployees dying, some companies are starting to fight.\nThey are teaching workers\nabout AIDS through videos, information\ncharts and lunch-time\ndiscussions in hopes of slowing\nthe virus and cutting their losses.\nBarclays Bank of Zambia Ltd\nplans to make condoms available its toilets for its 1,800 workers\nand is hiring a full-time\ncounsellor.\nZambia Airways holds seminars\nfor air crew who are considered\na' high. risk group.\nAs well as damaging the economy,\nAIDS is affecting medical\nservices.
