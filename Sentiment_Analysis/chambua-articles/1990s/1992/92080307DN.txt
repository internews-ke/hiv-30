{"text": "Change this negative view Aids\nIt is a saddening thing that lately, whenever\na young person dies in circumstances\nother than' those surrounding a\nroad accident, the word quickly goes\nround that the person was an Aids victim.\nThe family of the deceased is viewed\nby the majority with suspicion while an\nair of general disrepute surrounds the\ndeceased's name.\nThe purpose of this letter is not so much to\nfrown upon the whispering behaviour of Kenyans\n- for gossip is as much a part of nature\nas sleeping and eating - but, rather, to challenge\nKenyans to rise above the pettiness and\nfear that have led us into socially ostracising\nAids victims and their families.\nThe attitude many people have developed\ntowards Aids-sufferers and their families has\na lot to do with, first, the ignorance and misinformation\nthat many of us have about the\ndisease and, second, the secrecy and trepidation\nwith which victims and their families\nhandle the affliction spreads a cloak of mystery\nand dread around the subject of Aids;\nThe immediate and urgent question is\nwhether Aids can be viewed in a positive or,\nat least, informed and acceptable manner. In\nthis regard, it may be useful to look at the\nways in which other societies have handled\nAids. In so doing, one comes to the realisation\nthat there is much to be gained from a policy\nof openness and transparency as we strive to\nlive with this problem.\nThis sort of approach began with the late\nAmerican actor Rock Hudson who in 1985\nwent public with the shocking news that he\nhad Aids. This admission went a long way\ninto jolting Americans to the reality of Aids.\nInstitutes were set up to further research into\na cure for the disease and .charity funds were.\nset up to boost these institutes.\nThe fascination that Hollywood always conjures up in the minds of the public became\na useful tool for spreading information and\nchanging attitudes. For the black community\nin the US, famous sports celebrities like\n\"Magic\" Johnson and Arthur Ashe are, by\ntheir frank admissions, spreading knowledge\nas well as humanness about Aids and its\nvictims.\nLest we begin to associate this public approach\nwith the developed World, ,let me\nquickly give the example of neighbouring\nUganda. There, Phily Lutaya, a locally-born\nmusician of international fame, did for the\nUgandans what Rock Hudson did for the\nAmericans.\nOnce he learnt of his affliction, Lutaya returned to Uganda from his sojourn in Belgium,\nadmitted publicly that he was dying of\nAids and embarked on a campaign to show\nUgandans, from his personal example, what\nAids is all about. In Uganda today, education\nabout Aids is a national prerogative. The\nGovernment and its people are handling the\ndisease with forthrightness and sincerity.\nUgandans will tell you with amazing dignity,\nthe way Aids has affected their families.\nIt is with this kind of dignity that former\nPresident Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia told\nthe nation, and indeed the world at large, that\nhis son had died of Aids. In his view, what is\nimportant about Aids is not so much where it\ncame from, but, more correctly, where it is\ntaking us. A forward-looking and positive\nview that need not be fatalistic.\nHere in Kenya, we have had a number of\nindividuals making the admission that they\nhave tested HIV-positive. The majority of\nthese people are now members of the Know-\nAids Society which has dedicated itself to\nspreading facts about Aids countrywide. But\ngiven the negative attitude most Kenyans\nhave towards Aids, and given also the sheer\nmagnitude of the disease and the equally staggering ignorance with which Kenyans confront\nthe disease, I would argue that the\nKnow-Aids Society has failed.\nThe reason behind the lukewarm success of\nthis organisation is a simple one. With all due\nrespect to the people who head this body, it is\ntrue to say that none of them was a national\nfigure prior to their involvement in the Aids\ncampaign.\nThe principle behind the success of Rock\nHudson in the 'US and Phily Lutaya in\nUganda is that the public responds positively\nto people in positions of authority, be it social\nor political. Or, as a psychologist would put it,\nleaders are role-models. People look up to\nthem, they long to emulate their actions, to\ncopy their behaviour and mannerisms.\nAs far as national attitudes to Aids go, what,\nKenyans are in dire need of is the challenge of\npersonal example from the quarters of our\nnational figures.\nWe have heard (only in whispers, of course)\nof claims that some politicians, high-ranking\ntechnocrats and businessmen of national stature\nhave Aids. I want to argue here that if\nindeed some of these claims are true, and if\njust one of these personalities were to come\nout into the open with a public admission of\ntheir affliction, our currently negative view of\nAids would be nothing short of revolutionised.\nTo begin with, that individual's stature\nwould be, raised. Not that they would immediately\nbe exalted, but, with time, the public\nwould view with admiration his forthrightness\nand courage. This kind of public approach\ndoes, of course, demand the remarkable\nstamina and courage of a victim's family.\nWhat this also means is that Government\nefforts to educate wananchi about the HIV\nvirus will have been made much more easier.\nNyairo, J.W.
