{"text": "Aids trial major test for France \nBy PATRICK McDOWELL\nPARIS, Sunday\n'Like shopkeepers without scruples.\nthey sold blood. considering\nhaemophiliacs like customers and\nnot like patients,\" chief prosecutor\nMichele Bernard-Requin said\nin closing arguments on Friday in\na case in which French lawyers\nhave sued former government officials\nover Aids tainted blood.\nThe case stems from criminal\ncharges filed four years ago by\n1,000 hemophiliacs who received\nAids-tainted blood between\nMarch and October 1985.At least\n256 have since died.\nThe plaintiffs think the defendants\nare guilty of mass murder,\nand some declared themselves\n\"sickened\" by government inaction on the issue.\nFrance has been horrified by\nthe tale of callous bureaucrats\nallegedly putting the bottom line\nabove lives.\n\"How can these people sleep at\nnight.\" says Pascal, 34 one of the\nhaemophiliacs.\nFormer Premier Laurent Fabius,\nwho led the socialist\ngovernment from 1984 to 1988\ntried last Friday to express\n.sympathies from the witness\nstand. He met hisses and jeers\n. \"Assassins\" cried protesters\noutside the Palais de Justice \"you\nhave blood on your hands'.\nMr Fabius left court under an\narmed guard of the size usually\nreserved for terrorist trials. In the\neyes of many Frenchmen, it is his\ngovernment on trial.\nThe court revelations have also\nunderscored France's schizophrenic\nrecord on Acquired Immune\nDefiency Syndrome.\nThough Pasteur Institute scientists\nwere among the first to\nisolate the HIV virus that causes\nthe disease, France has the worst\nAids rate in Europe.\nNumerous poster campaigns\nadvising people to use condoms\nhave failed to break old habits.\nSome 22,000 people suffer from\nthe disease, and an estimated\n200,000 carry the HIV virus.\nThe questions hammered\nhome by media and lawyers since\nthe trial opened six weeks ago\nare: When did officials know the\nblood was contaminated? and\nwhy didn't they do anything?\nEx-Deputy Health Minister\nEdmond Herve shocked the court\nlast week when he admitted\nknowing by June 20, 1985, that\nnearly all of France's blood stocks\nwere contaminated.\nYet he did not order them\nwithdrawn for four more months,\nalmost a year after the United\nStates developed expensive\nequipment to decontaminate\nblood with heat.\nThe plaintiffs believes that officialdom\ndidn't purchase the\nequipment in order to give the\nPasteur Institute, a rival of US\nlaboratories in Aids research,\ntime to develop its own system.\nWhy wasn't the blood simply\nwithdrawn? they had no clear answer,\nbut' insisted the reason was\nnot financial. The stocks were\nworth an estimate $40 million. \nThe defendants say they are scapegoats who carried out policy at least implicitly approved at cabinet level.\nLawyers for the plaintiffs have launched the difficult process of brining charges against Fabius, and Georgina Dufoix ex Minister for Social Affairs,\nIt is doubtful the case will get far. Only the high Court of Justice, France\u2019s top criminal court, can bring charges against Ministers related to their duties. However, any trial would have to be conducted through impeachment proceedings in Parliament.\nAttorneys are seeking 2 million francs $400,00 in punitive damages for each haemophiliacs or for his or her survivors. They will also receive the same amount from an independent commission (AP)_  "}
