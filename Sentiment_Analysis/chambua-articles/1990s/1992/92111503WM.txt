However, the\ndenial was 'short-lived and studies\nan ,,\"8riausaspects .of Aids simply\nreveal mare chilling data and\nfacts.\nAccording to projections by experts\nfrom the long range planning\ndivision of Ministry of Planning and international Development\nindicate that by 1995 the number of people killed by Aids virus will\nreach 320.000 while up to\n2,124,000'people with the carrier of the lethal virus.
