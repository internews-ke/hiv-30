{"text": "Wednesday, November 4, 1992\n\nAids error may cost hospital dearly\u2028\n By ADRIAN CROFT,\nSAN FRANCISCO, Monday\n\nIn 1986, John Kuivenhoven went\nto see a doctor complaining of\nflu-like symptoms and was diagnosed\nas having Aids.\nAfter six years of treatment -\nduring which he gave up his job,\nlived on welfare and suffered terrible\nand irreversible side effects\n- doctors told Mr Kuivenhoven\nlast June it was all a mistake. He\ndid not have Aids and could live a\nnormal life.\nNow, Mr Kuivenhoven, 53, is\nseeking $32 million in damages\nfrom the hospital which he alleges\nmisdiagnosed him as having\nthe Acquired Immune Deficiency\nSyndrome.\n\"I feel as if I was imprisoned\nand the warden comes to me and\nsays: 'Mr Kuivenhoven, we've\nmade a horrible mistake. You're\nnot guilty. Go out and live your\nlife,' \" he told a news conference\nlast week.\n\nThe problem for Mr\nKuivenhoven is that he cannot go\nback to a normal life. \"I still\nthink of myself as a person with\nAids,\" he says.\nHe suffers from hypertension,\nhigh blood pressure, migraine\nheadaches, a neurological condition known as neuropathy, and\nhas bouts of asthma and bronchitis,\nwhich he believes are all the\nresult of medication he was given\nduring treatment for Aids.\n\"He's thought of himself as a\nperson with Aids for so long that\nthis reversal of fortune has been\noverwhelming, difficult to accept,\"\nsaid Mr Kuivenhoven's attorney,\nMr Paul Wotman.\nMr Wotman said that at one\nstage, Mr Kuivenhoven was told\nhe had only six months to live.\n\"Each day he prepared himself to\ndie,\" the lawyer said.\nMr Kuiverihoven also feared he\nhad transmitted the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),  which\ncauses Aids, to his male\nlover, who died of Aids in September,\nMr Wotman said.\n\"He's coming forth with his\nstory now because he thinks\nthere could be others who've been\nmisdiagnosed and it's important\nto talk about,\" Mr Wotman said\nat the news conference.\nMr Wotman said Mr\nKuivenhoven was making the\nclaim against San Francisco's\nKaiser PerD;lanente Medical\nCentre because he had suffered\nserious financial loss, emotional\ndistress and permanent physical\ndamage and needed future medical\ncare.\nMr Kuivenhoven's medical\nplan bars him from taking the\nhospital to court, but he can go to\nbinding arbitration with a panel\nof lawyers and a judge.\nA spokesman for Kaiser\nPermanente said last week that\nthe centre had received Mr\nKuivenhoven's demand for arbitration but could not comment in\ndetail until it had studied his\nmedical records.\nMr Kuivenhoven said he was\nnot angry at the people who had\ntreated him but he was angry at\nthe system which allowed the error\nto go on so long.\nHe says he suffered severe\nheadaches as a side effect of an\nAids drug he was given.\nThe discovery was made after a\nroutine check showed\nKuivenhoven's T-cells! count,\nwhich drops rapidly in Aids patients,\nhad risen sharply.\nMr Kuivenhoven said that as\nfar as he knew, he had not been\ngiven an HIV test until the mistake\nwas discovered.\nMr Wotman said it was the\nfirst case he knew of where a patient\nhad been misdiagnosed as\nhaving Aids for six years.\n\"I don't think this is a widespread\nproblem, but I'm sure he's\nnot the only one,\" he said"}
