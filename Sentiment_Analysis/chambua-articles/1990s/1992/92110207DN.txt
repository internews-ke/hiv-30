{"text": "Article on Nyambene misleading\nThe Nation should apologise to\nNyambene District residents for publishing\nan insulting statement from a\nGovernment officer in the district (Daily\nNation, October 26).\nNyambene is known for its disciplined and\ncultured people. The officer had not done any\nresearch concerning miraa nor the cause of\nsexually transmitted diseases (STDs).\nSTDs had affected almost the whole world\neven before miraa was discovered. To prove\nthe officer wrong, Aids did not originate from\nNyambene District.\nThe district's population is very high compared\nto other parts of the country. It is\nwrong for the officer to connect miraa chewing\nwith child labour problems and illiteracy.\nWe have a large number of educated people in\nthe district, despite miraa production.\nAny problems pertaining to child labour,\nilliteracy, STDs and under-population in the\ndistrict are similar to those experienced in\nother areas.\nIt, does not mean that we get these problems\nin this district alone.\nResearch conducted by the out-going Meru\nDistrict Officer, Mr Machira Apollos, for a Canadian project indicated ignorance on his\npart regarding the people he has been living\nwith. Why has he been quiet all this time?\nThe young miraa traders who travel all\nover the towns in the country are not the only\npeople who travel for their daily bread. These\npeople are disciplined, cultured and most of\nthem are Christians.\nSo, I would like to dismiss the allegation\nmade by Mr Apollos as a lie.\nI was born in the district and I have known\nmiraa as our cash crop, therefore the residents\nshould be respected, not insulted.\nThese people did not apply to be born in\nthis district as other people also did not apply\nto be born in their respective areas.\nWas the officer telling us that the areas\nmentioned in the report are the worst-hit by\nSTDs in' the world?\nAren't there any other areas affected by the\ndiseases?\nIn areas such as Kisumu where fishing is a\nway of life, or where coffee, tobacco and cotton\nare grown, children, who have to work to\nget school fees, are affected by these activities,\nso Nvambene is not an exception.\nCoffee, \"tea and cigarettes, according to\nmedical research, have proved worse than miraa on human health, yet they are still\ngrown for human consumption.\nMiraa is not responsible for child labour,\nnor do we force children to work in miraa\nplantations. It does not reduce appetite nor\ndoes it effect sleep. It does not reduce sexual\ndesire either.\nIf anything, the officer's statement might\ncripple miraa business in the district.\nI appeal to the Government to issue licences\nto miraa sellers in the district. Presently,\nthis business is mainly done by people\nfrom outside the district.\nIt is high time Nyambene people sold their\ncrop, even to foreign countries, by themselves.\nIf tobacco and beer have a market within\nand outside the country, I don't see why the\nGovernment should not help miraa sellers\nget a market in foreign countries.\nThe Government should assist in scrapping\nthe Meru Country Council system of asking\nmiraa businessmen to pay cess.\nMirna cess should be done away with for\nthe betterment of our people.\nThe Rev Joseph Gichunge,\nNyambene District YK'92 chairman,\nand the Rev Mirithi Kiunga,\norganising secretary.\n\nQUOTE OF THE DAY\n\"Around three per cent of women\nattending routine antenatal care\nare currently estimated to have\nHIV antibodies.\" - A United\nNations Children's Fund\n(UNICEF) report' which says\nthe number of Aids cases in\nKenya doubles every nine\n'months."}
