E\"tu. \u2028\nWill medical researchers ever find a cure for Aida? What has become Of \u2028\nthe vaccines Kemron, Immunex and the first Aids drug AZT? What \u2028\nabout the new compound called Cytopar? Are there any other new \u2028\ncompounds being developed? \u2028\nThese are just some Of the questions that worry medical experts Who \u2028\nbelieve that, unless a Cure is found, some nations may depopulated \u2028\nif the level Of infection reaches 30 per cent. \u2028\nDespite increased health education \u2028\ncontinue to be infected With the Aids \u2028\nOrganisation says may 40 million people. \u2028\nThe number increasing rapidly in Africa where millions Will die \u2028\nbecause Of illiteracy, ignorance and the lack of medical equipment \u2028\nneeded for sterilisation and blood screening. \u2028\nr, the results of a released the Institute of \u2028\nResearch Studies at the University Of Nairobi indicate that \u2028\nintimate and casual sex is still rampant in the country an Aids \u2028\ncontrol has a long way to \u2028\nSome doctors in Kenya believe that talking about the march for an \u2028\nAids cure encourages lax attitudes among people. However, others like \u2028\nProf Arthur Obel \u2014 who this week said that a new anti_Aids (inset) \u2028\nthat \u2028\ncompound, Cytopar, is be. investigated \u2014 believe that it is inhuman \u2028\nto just sit and wait for patients to die. \u2028\n\"Doctors and medical researchers have a moral duty to \u2028\nlook for new drugs and modes Of \u2028\ntreatment that can keep patients \u2028\nin an interview at \u2028\noffice in Nairobi. 'The virus has \u2028\ndefied researchers in nations With \u2028\nultra-modern technologies and \u2028\nwe can no longer Wait despite \u2028\nlimitations,\" he added. \u2028\nIn 1981, Prof Obel identified \u2028\nand documented proven cases of \u2028\nalthough\u2028\nthree years after. Of \u2028\nthe local experts \u2014 with Dr Davy \u2028\nthe director of Kenya \u2028\nMedical Research Institute \u2014 \u2028\ne with Kemron, the \u2028\nAids drug based on oral \u2028\nuse  low-dose natural interferon \u2028\nalpha. However, the professor \u2028\nsaid that although he was involved in the initial work on \u2028\nKemron, he is no longer qualified \u2028\nto talk about drug and  com- \u2028\npound he is using is actually \u2028\nswallowed and not absorbed in \u2028\nthe mouth like Kemron. \u2028\nThere is need to constantly \u2028\nremind people about preventive \u2028\nProf Obel \u2028\nmeasures \u2028\nemphasised. \u2028\n' 'The emergence of Kemron \u2028\nand another interferon-based \u2028\ndrug, Immunex, should be seen as \u2028\npostive moves in the war against \u2028\nand there is no need for \u2028\nunnecessary struggles because \u2028\nthe truth always come out,\" \u2028\nProf Obel said. \u2028\nResearchers should \u2028\nbe looking for and trying Out sub- \u2028\nstances \"at show advantages in \u2028\nhe added. \u2028\nHe said that high interest in \u2028\nfinding effective drugs against \u2028\nthe disease goes back to the first \u2028\ncase he identified. \" \u2028\npatients \u2028\nme first and their \u2028\nis \u2028\nOne-Aids \u2028\nwho won't throw \u2028\nin the towel yet \u2028\nam an optimist and I believe \u2028\nthat, With constant effort, it Wili \u2028\nbe possible to provide better \u2028\nmanagement or even contain the \u2028\ndisease,\" he said. \u2028\nThere is still much to be understanding of the nature of both the \u2028\nAid\" virus and the disease itself. \u2028\nThe professor said that it may be \u2028\npossible that the virus Stands by \u2028\nafter initiating e chain of reactions that destroy the body. \u2028\nand and \u2028\ncell and \u2028\ntheir impact on \u2028\nmechanisms can be negative. \u2028\nThere are cages of diarrhoea in \u2028\nAids patients which be \u2028\nlinked to excessive release free \u2028\nmolecules Or radicals, he \u2028\nProf Obers management Of \u2028\nalso involves the removal Of \u2028\nthese radicals that may be interfering with the body's functions. \u2028\ndimension in the management \u2028\nOf the disease. \u2028\nCytopar stabilises cell membranes, enabling the return of \u2028\nnormal function, and it helps deal \u2028\nwith anaesthesia, a condition \u2028\ncommon in Aids patients with \u2028\nlow blood pressure and weight \u2028\nloss. This condition is also common in those With disease. The drug also stimulates \u2028\nbody cells. \u2028\nProf Obel said there need \u2028\nremove the stigma associated \u2028\nwith Aids because it makes \u2028\npeople to shy away from treatment and counselling. However, \u2028\nexperimental treatment come \u2028\nfrom Kenya, Tanzania and \u2028\nUganda. \u2028\nProf said that apart from \u2028\nthe obvious need to do \u2028\nfor the large number of those infected by the virus, his train. \u2028\nand interests in metabolic \u2028\ncine, clinical medicine and pharmacology plus \u2028\nto pay more attention to the \u2028\nHis experimental drug gives \u2028\nKenyans at least four anti-Aids \u2028\ndrugs, including Kemron, \u2028\nImmunex and AH. week, \u2028\nan official Of the Welcome Foundation, which markets AZT, the \u2028\nfirst anti -Aids drug. told the Sunday Nation that recent tests indicate the drug delays the onset \u2028\nof Aids or the final stages of infection with the Human \u2028\nImmunodeficiency Virus (HIV). \u2028\nAlthough the country has these \u2028\nfour drugs, there is still room for \u2028\nscreening herbs for antiviral \u2028\nproperties. However, thing may \u2028\nnot be easy. There is much jealousy and \u2028\nmalice among \u2028\nThey \u2028\ninnovations or \u2028\nefforts \u2028\nUnlike the in countries \u2028\nsuch as Kenya: no \u2028\n, the fact of American coming to Kenya \u2028\nand collecting to produce \u2028\nanti-cancer drugs, discredit Kenya \u2028\nFinally, Kenyans should be re- \u2028\nminded that the effort to \u2028\nfind effective drug, they \u2028\nmust stick to their sex partners \u2028\nindiscriminate and casual sex simply means death. The \u2028\ncure for Aids has yet to be \u2028\nannounced. "}
