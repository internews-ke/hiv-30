{"text": "Aids: A virus with, a country under siege\nAll-round public education the only way out\nThe Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome has become a\nmajor menace in Kenya and other nations. It is already causing\nindescribable misery, poverty and death\". DR SOBBIE\nMULINDI, the. chairman of Information, Education,\nCommunication of the National Aids Committee examines the\nchallenges linked to this problem.\nThe political changes have come\nat a time when Aids, that deadly\ndisease is taking an increasing\ntoll on the population.\nBut typical of their nature,\nKenyans politicians are taking\nmore time talking about other\nthings instead of educating the\npeople about it.\nAnd the people need educating\nbecause through no fault of some\nof them, many people do not really\nunderstand just how serious\nthe Aids problem is. What is\nmore, the figures usually published\nin the press about the\nnumber of victims is usually just\nthe tip of the iceberg.\nInformation obtained from\nblood donors, published studies\nand surveillance done by the National Aids Programme, show prevalence rate of 7.5 per cent\nnationwide. There are more than\n700,000 Kenyans infected with\nthe Aids virus. They are healthy\ncarriers who easily infect others.\nThere may be 1.7 million HIV\ncarriers in 1996.\u2022 The most hit\nareas are Coast Province,\nNyanza, Western and Nairobi.\nBut people in all parts of Kenya\nare at risk.\nAids is a leading cause of premature\ndeath. It will be one of\nthe most serious epidemics of\nthis century. Kenya faces a vast\nand growing burden of illness and\ndeath associated with HIV/Aids.\nIt will have tragic consequences\nfor individuals, families and communities\nand devastating consequences\nfor health services and\nthe economy.\nThe National Aids Committee\nhas tried to sensitise the public\nthrough the mass media, seminars,\nworkshops and conferences.\nThe committee has met with lawyers,\nparlimentarians and is fully\ninvolved in the global anti-Aids\nstruggle.\nThere are many highly skilled\nKenyans in whom the country\nhas heavily invested who will die\nif a cure is not found within five\nyears. Kenyans will have to overcome\nthe fear and ignorance\nlinked to Aids and its mode of\ntransmission because it can lead\nto social rejection, stigmatisation\nand discrimination.\nThese people can be sacked\nfrom their jobs, refused treatment\nby doctors and nurses.\nThey may be expelled from foreign countries, refused housing,\nschooling, insurance and exploited\nfrom fake cures\nThe only way to overcome\nthese issues is through massive\nhealth education campaigns and\ncounselling.\nSpecific mechanisms of changing\nbehaviour include modification\nof sexual practices of infected persons, routinely offering\ntesting and counselling to persons\nat high risk. Effective information\nand education include a\nwide spectrum of activities ranging\nfrom radio, TV. print media,\nbarazas to individual counselling\nsessions.\nEducation\nThe health education component\nof the National Aids Committee\nis directed to the general\npublic, school and college aged\nyoung persons, to other persons\nat risk and to health workers.\nThe lethal infection devastates\nthe youth who are not only sexually\nactive, but also those who are\neconomically productive and are\nthe backbone of the economy and\nthe future.\nImmaturity among the youth\nresults in unstable sexual relationships (like not having one\nstable faithful partner).\nCross-national mobility enhances\nthe risk of being infected\nby the virus. This means that\nmore has to be done to educate\nthe youth about safer sex without\npretences. Those involved in the\nschool curricula development\nshould speed their efforts in this\ndirection.\nAids will have an effect; on\nmarriages and demography.\nThere will be a great deal of anxiety\nand hesitation to marry. Couples\nalready infected, will give\nbirth to babies with HIV. This\nwill affect the normal age groups\nwithin the population.\nAlready, some youth in our institutions\n(Secondary schools,\ncolleges, universities) are infected\nwith HIV and go on to infect others.\nThis trend must be arrested\nat all costs.\nSex education emphasising\nprevention of Aids must be\ntaught in all learning institutions.\nTeachers and Parents Association\nas well as the Kenya\nNational Union of Teachers have\na crucial role to play since they\nare in daily contact with the\nyouth.\nIn Kenya, like other African\nnations, Aids is a family disease.\nThe death of one spouse will\nautomatically lead to the death of\nthe other spouse. Therefore, children\nare going to be orphaned\nand abandoned.\nThe loss has emotional, psychological\nand economic implications\nto the family and community\nat large.\nIn 1996, it is estimated that\nabout 300,000 children will be left\norphans. Indeed this will 'be a big\nburden. Many children will be orphaned\nand because of lack of extended\nfamily care due to economic\nhardships, there will be an\nincrease in \"rural and urban\nhomeless children.\nThese children will be further\nvulnerable to HIV infection\nthrough need for shelter, food,\nmoney and exchange for sex.\nThere is going to be increased\nfamily instability (fights, suicides,\nrape, theft, and won).\nThere will also be Aids caused\nstress and various psychiatric\ndisorders that can lead to some of\nthe above.\nThere is lack of trained counsellors\nand services to cope with\nthe problem. Aids will cause demand\nfor medical care unheard of\nin human history; difficult policy\ndecisions (home-based care, community\ncare) will be required for\ntreatment of Aids victims.\nAids has become one of the\ngravest threats to public health\nand there will be shortage of\ndrugs due to increased opportunistic\ninfections among: HIV infected\npersons.\nThere is need to determine\nhealth services costs (direct\ncosts) as well as the cost in lost\nproductivity (indirect costs) that\nwill result from illness and premature\ndeath not only of patients\nbut also of health workers. There\nwill be need to increase resources\nallocated to the health sector.\nIt is expensive to afford palliative\ncare (AZT, Kemron,\nImmunex and so on). The already\nimpoverished patients faced with increasing inflation will find it\nextremely expensive to buy drugs\nas well as struggle to survive with\nmeagre resources.\nAids death will equal or exceed\ndeath from all other causes.\nIndividual rights will be infringed\n(travel, housing, school,\nwork and so on). The Government\nthat comes to power will\nneed to make a firm stand not to\ndiscriminate HIV/Aids persons.\nFamily rights versus confidentiality\nposes another ethical problem.\nThe question of partner notification\nupon being diagnosed\nHIV positive will prove increasing\ndifficult for individuals as\nwell as families.\nThere is the issue of Society\nRights (Public Health Act);\nCriminal law (eg. when .one\nknows he/she is already infected\nwith virus and goes on to infect\nothers indiscriminately). Counselling\nis therefore crucial in preventing\nsuch cases. Health workers\nmust be provided with\nadequate skills in counselling to\nbe able to assist patients\neffectively.\nPolicy\nInheritance and other social,\ncultural practices (polygamy, circumcision,\near-piercing and so\non) will have to be reviewed.\nThere is need for policy guidelines\nsince these socio-cultural\npractices have been known to\nspread Aids.\nThe insurance industry will\nneed to be streamlined and given\nguidelines on various forms of insurance\nwith the HIV/Aids in\nmind. Life insurers are exposed\nto increased liabilities on existing\npolicies and there is a need to\nlimit future liabilities.\nThe insurance companies\nshould also take a leading role in\neducating their clients about Aids\nsince they would not like to 'lose\nbusiness caused by pre-mature\ndeath.\nWhat about leaders who are as\nmortal as the rest of the people?\nMany have died and many more\nwill die unless they change their\nways.\nThis brings in the issue of a\nleadership vacuum in many areas\nwhich can be very dangerous.\nLack of good leaders can cause\nexternal interference. Uncontrolled\nAids will cause insecurity\nbecause of the loss of key persons,\nespecially in the army, police,\nprisons. CID, Special Branch\nand other security related\norganisations.\nManpower loss (in industry,\nagriculture, education and so on)\nwill have a negative impact on\nproductivity and training. Vital\nearnings will dwindle. This will affect the labour force of the sugar,\ntea and coffee growing industries\nreducing production in these\nand other key sectors.\nTourism and foreign exchange\nearnings will be badly affected by\nthe impact of Aids. Apart from a\nnumber of areas, food production\nwill fall as the disease spreads to\nthe rural areas. Many women\nwho work on farms will die from\nAids after being infected by husbands\nwho worked as migrant\nworkers in the urban setting.\nAids will divert resources away\nfrom all other preventable and\ntreatable diseases and health programmes.\nAids will also have impact\non the Stock Market.\nThe -control and prevention of\nAids threat should be coordinated\ndirectly from the Office\nof the President to mobilise all\nSectolll of the society. There should be top level\ninterministerial consultations on\nhow to handle effectively the\nAids situation in the country.\nThere should be intensified\nsubsidized media campaign, budget allocation for different ministries to help control Aids. The\nGovernment and private sector\nshould devote adequate resources\nand an Aids fund should be started\nsoon.\nThe Aids Programme Secretariat\nlacks facilities for the effective\nimplementation of' the\nProgramme.\nFaced with one of the greatest\nepidemics of our time, any future\ngovernment must make prevention and control of HIV a priority\nof all priorities.\nTomorrow: Agriculture\nA nurse takes blood from a baby infected with the Aids virus in a New York Hospital. Unless a lot of hard'\nwork in public education and counselling in prevention is done, the Kenyan situation could pull out of\ncontrol, warn the experts."}
