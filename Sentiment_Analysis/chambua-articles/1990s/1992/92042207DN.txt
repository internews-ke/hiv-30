{"text": "Rushdie must die for his mischief\nI wish to comment on the letter\nby Mr Murumba Eric Wambasi\n(Nation, April 6) concerning\nSalman Rushdie.\nPoor Salman Rushdie has encroached\non the boundaries set\nby God and tried to pursue his\nmaterial world greed in order to\ngain fame from Westerners.\nBut to his misfortune, Rushdie\ncompletely forgot that Muslims\nare ardent believers who would\nnot let him get away with his devilish\nworks.\nIf Rushdie was lured by the demon\nconcept of the west that\nman is free and can do whatever\nhe or she wants, he (Rushdie) has\nto bear in mind that man is free\nbut accountable for his deeds.\nAnother point in the letter\nwhich really moved me is when\nWambasi said that Muslims fast\nin the month of Ramadhan to\nglorify Issa Ibnu Mariama.\nIt would have better for him if\nhe had known our religion or discussed\nthis matter with a\nMuslim.\nTo make him understand beyond\ndoubt, we fast for nobody -\nneither Jesus Christ nor\nMohamed (peace be upon him) -\nbut to Allah. As Allah said in one\nof his holy Hadith (habith\nuliqudsi), \"Fasting is mine and I\nalone pay its reward\".\nThis clearly shows that we\nattribute fasting to no one except\nto Allah. But when it comes to\nJesus Christ, we respect him as\none of the chosen prophets mentioned\nin the holy Quran.\nSo, Mr Wambasi, you have to\napologise to your fellow Muslim\nbrothers and sisters for your\nwrong interpretation. But if you\nwere taught that Muslims are intolerant,\nyou are wrong. Our tolerance\nis proved by the sacred\nmonth of Ramadham when we\nnot only abstain from eating and\ndrinking during daytime, but\nfrom all carnal' desires - sex etc.\nThe other point worth discussing\nis the content of Wambasi letter's\nlast paragraph in which he\nsaid that In the new world order,\nRushdie should be condemned by\nnone other than Allah himself.\nMy friend, don't you know that\nthe so-called new world order\nphrase emanated from a crazy\nAmerican politician in the White\nHouse just to sharpen American\nself-interest politics .\nDo you want to tell me that\nAmericans take the lead and command the world in a way that\npleases every nation? If yes, why\nare Americans struggling to overcome\nthe killer disease, Aids and\nthe HIV virus?\nWhy does America spends billions\nof dollars in fighting the\ndrug cartel? Why is America in a\ndeep recession as the result of the\nJapanese miraculous economic\npower?\nDoes the new world order\nmean America turns a blind eye\nto what is going on in Algeria and\nSouth Africa, or to the millions of\nPalestinians suffering at the\nhands of Jews?\nIs this the new world order\nwhere America and her puppets\nalways want to pick on any Islamic\nnation that claims to be\nself-sufficient?\nIt is not a new world order\nwhen the White House merely\nbeats the drums of democracy to\nthe Third World countries and\nstirs up trouble among themselves\nand then evacuates her citizens\nwhen things fall apart.\nI can not say it is a new world\norder but a new version of neocolonialism.\nStrictly speaking, this world\nhas already been set in order by\nits creator - Allah or God whichever\nyou prefer - and it will go on\nthe way he predetermined it\nuntil doomsday.\nSince the US declared the new\nworld order, have you ever seen\nany morning when the sun rose\nfrom the west or north instead of\nfrom the east?\nAs for Rushdie's case, the penalty\nof Allah is not here in this\nworld but in the hereafter and to\nus Muslims as mankind.\nSince Allah appointed mankind\nto be the vicegerent in this\nvast universe, then it is our duty\nand responsibility to eliminate\nanyone who happens to commit a\nmischief in this world.\nSo, the case of Rushdie will remain\nintact until he is either\nslain in the hands of Muslima or\ndies otherwise.\nTherefore, do not waste time\narguing about this man called\nRushdie or even think of his\nname. There is something that\ntells you that Salman Rushdie\nhas done a 'Rush-to-Die' act.\nDmar M. M\"I,\nNairolli."}
