{"text": "Treatment eases dilemma for\nAids patients\nBOSTON: One medicine will keep you alive.\nAnother will save your eyesight But you\n.cannot take both.\nThat is a dilemma for many people with\nAids. They can take AZT, a 'medicine that\nslows HIV, the Aids virus, or. they can take\nGanciclovir, a medicine that stops a blinding\neye infection.\nBut since both drugs cause anaemia. many\ncannot tolerate them together.\n\"A lot of people need to make a choice,\"\nsaid Jay S. Duker. \"Go off AZT and shorten\nyour life, or stay on AZT and go' blind.\"\nTo give patients a. third choice,\nresearchers have 'developed a new way of\ndelivering the eye medicine so it won't cause\nanaemia. The strategy: Implant minuscule\nsustained-release pellets inside the eyeball.\nThis keeps the drug out of the\nbloodstream and inside the eye. where it is\nneeded. And it is released at a slow, steady\nrate without the ups and downs of daily\ninfusions.\nThis idea is just one of dozens of new\napproaches being developed to control\nopportunistic .infections ~ -the usually ;\nharmless germs that attack people with .]'.'\nAids weakened immune defences. The\npharmaceutical industry. estimates that\nmore than 40 drugs are being tested against.\nthese viruses, bacteria and other microscopic invaders common among Aids patients. (AP)"}
