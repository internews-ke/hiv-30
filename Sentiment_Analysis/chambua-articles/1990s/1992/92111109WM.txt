{"text": "Unicef report says\nchild labour law\nin Kenya is vague\nBy NATION Correspondent\nThe law on child labour in Kenya\nis vague, a report prepared by the\nUnited Nations Children's Fund\n(Unicef) in conjunction with the\nKenya Government says.\nThe report which is titled Children\nand Women in Kenya, a\nSituation Analysis of 1992, says\nthe law on child labour as presently\ndrafted, does not protect\nchildren adequately and it is difficult\nto enforce.\n. Signed by Unicefs representative\nto Kenya, Mr Vincent\nO'Reilly and the Permanent Secretary\nin the Ministry of Planning\nand National Development,\nFares M. Kuindwa, it says that it\nseems most people who employ\n\u2022\nchildren either do not know or do\nunderstand Kenya's child\nlabour law.\nIt says that in order for child\nlabour to be effectively tackled\nthe public should be made aware\nof the fact that exploitative\nlabour exists and has harmful effects\non children.\nAccording to the authors of the\ndocument, there is also a need to\nimprove the living standards\nwithin the family and the community,\nadding that this should\nbe done by improving access to\nbasic services, promoting income generating activities and\nfamily planning services.\nThe Government, it says, must\nbe encouraged to formulate a\nnational policy to protect working\nchildren by improving their\nworking conditions, especially because\nchildren are the most and\neasily exploited of all workers.\nOn the issue of adolescent\nmothers, aged between 12 and 18\nyears, it is recorded that they are\non the increase in the country and these mothers and their\nc n are at special risk of infirmity and death because of\ntheir poor legal and socio ecomomic\nstatus and also because they lack knowledge of the needs for child survival and\ndevelopment.\n. Unicef (Kenya) says that\namong these adolescent mothers\nare schoolgirls, street girls and\nchild brides most of whom come\nfrom poor families. Most of the\nchild brides and adolescent mothers\nare found within particular\nethnic groups, especially at the\nCoast and North Eastern Province,\nwhere early marriages for\ngirls, usually arranged for them\nwithout their knowledge by their\nparents.\nOn neglected and destitute\nchildren, it says that destitute\nchildren in Nairobi, have been\nborn in the streets and do not\nknow any other type of life.\n\"Their only social contact is with\nother destitute families or children.\"\n.\nThe authors of the report say\nthat the neglect and destitution\nwhich befalls the children whose\nparents die of AIDS is particularly\nworrying because it is aggravated\nby a total misunderstanding\nof the nature of the disease as\nwell as a fear of the stigma attached\nto it.\"\nIt adds that because Aids is associated\nwith promiscuity, prostitution\nor other socially unacceptable\nbehaviour, the extended\nfamily - the traditional refuge for\norphaned children - may abandon\nthe children rather than provide\nfor and care for them.\nThe child body says that the\nGovernment, Non-Governmental\nOrganisations and religious\norganisations must step in to\neducate communities about the\nHIV virus and Aids, the disease\nthat it causes, and strengthen\ncommunal organisations interested\nin Aids-related issues.\nTurning to disabled children,\nthe report says that about\n115,000 children are currently\nsuffering from a variety of handicaps\nincluding blindness, deafness and limb disability many of\nwhich could have been' prevented\nhad the children had access to\nadequate health care, good nutrition and the education of their\nparents, especially the mothers.\nThe report says it is unfortunate\nthat parents and communities\nare not educated and\nmobilised to recognise and meet\nthe needs of disabled children.\n\"Many parents, responding to\nsocial traditions and taboos concerning\nthe disabled, still hide\naway their disabled children, thus\ncondemning them to even more\nfully to a life in which whatever\nhealth educational services that\nmay be available are automatically\nout of their reach.\nOn displaced children, Unicef\nreports that although there was\nno available precise data on the\nnumber of displaced children in\nKenya, it was clear that such\nchildren and their mothers suffered\nmany hardships which included\ninsecurity and lack of basic\nnecessities such as food, water\nand shelter.\nThe report also indicates that\nin addition to this, many displaced\nchildren are orphaned,\nmost have their education interrupted  and all are at unusually\nhigh risk of malnutrition, disease\nand death.\nThe UN body also says that\nchildren of nomads were faced\nwith a high risk of malnutrition\ndisease and premature deaths. It\nsays that although the Government\nand NGOs have established\nhealth and educational facilities\nand other programmes for Kenya's\nnomadic population, the facilities\nare few and their distance\nfrom a temporary settlement is\noften prohibitive.\nDespite this profusion of programmes,\nthe report says, the\nnumbers of children in especially\ndifficult circumstances continue\nto escalate at such an alarming rate that existing efforts provide\nmerely a token response to the\nchildren.\nThe. report recommends that\nconcerned agencies concentrate\nmore on preventive rather than curative measures for the programmes\nto have a real impact.\nIt is poverty, according to the\nreport, which is the primary\ncause of the problems and it must\nbe addressed directly. Its conclusion is that introducing\nserious measures to alleviate\npoverty in the poorest sections of\nKenya's population, whether in\nrural or urban areas, remains the\nnation's greatest challenge.\nChild labour: Children workers are the easiest to exploit and they are the most exploited, but the law on\nchild labour is difficult to enforce.
