{"text": "A turning point in 'changing generations'\nBy WANGUI GACHIE\\\n\"Its going to be the world premier!\"\nJames Faulkland said of\nthe opening gala night of the\nPhoenix Players' musical The\nChanging Generations.\nThe Christmas mood has began\nto creep up again and its\nspit-and-polish time at the\nPhoenix.\nThe Christmas offering will be\ndifferent this year. This is the\nfirst time that there has ever\nbeen a totally Kenyan Christmas\nmusical.\nWritten by James Faulkland it\nhas the full score composed by\nSuzanne Gachukia and Joy\nMboya of Musikly Speaking. It\nalso the single largest production\never sponsored by the United\nNations Children. Fund (UNICEF),\nlocally.\nThe show will open with a Gala\nnight - which Director James\nFaulkland has baptised The\nWorld Premier- on Friday Night\nwith the Attorney General Amos\nWako being expected as the guest\nof honour. It will run till December,\n19, to resume on the 4th to\nrun till the 16th of January,1993.\nIn past Christmas productions\nby the Phoenix like The Kenyan\nGondoliers, The Kenyan Mikado\nthere was a general move towards\nmaking the musicals more Kenyan\nin orientation .\nThe shows had rave reviews.\nFor once Kenyans could go to the\ntheatre and watch a great musical\nthat WaS spiced with the\nhumourous tinge drawn from local\ncircumstances and situations.\nThe tongue-in-cheek humour was,\nricher, the jokes funnier. People\nlaughed but caught the message.\n\"After the success of the Gondoliers\nand under the encouraging\ninfluence of a couple of Vodo kas, Suzanne, Joy and I made a\npact that the next musical would\nnot be an adaptation but would\nbe our own, home grown Kenyan\nproduct\" James said.\nThis was the birth of the concept\nthat has grown to be the 30\ncast production of The Changing\nGenerations.\n. The thrust of the play is rich\nand multi-layered. It is a sensitive,\ngently-woven tapestry of the\nconcerns and issues that many\nordinary Kenyan people are having\nto contend with everyday.\nThe theme of tribalism in Kenyan society is played out in a\nwarm and blossoming love staked\nout between two cultures. There\nare ominous warnings from the\nolder generation who believe that\nlove cannot be allowed to blossom\nbetween Luo Josh (played by\nMaurice Oyando) and Kikuyu\nWanja (played by Mercy\nWambugu).\nThe trials of love under seige\nare played out with witty dialogue\nthat spills into song. There\nare 25 different musical pieces in\nthe play that will take the audience\nthrough all shades of emotion.\nThe play also addressed the\nconflicts and crises that the Aids\nputs on relationships as one of\nthe characters is diagnosed HIV\npositive. In this way it is attempting\nto spread an important\nmessage to the audience through\nthe oral tradition .\nThe team has already been invited\nto perform in South Africa,\nJohannnesburg. The production\nis being filmed by the East African\nFilms Ltd and a video version\nwill be circulated throughout\nAfrica.\nMaurice Oyando and Mercy Watf1bui, who played as young lovers in The Kenyan Gondoliers,\nwill take part in Changing Generations."}
