{"text": "WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 11, 1992\n\nWhere did the virus come from?\n\nBy OPIYO OFULLA\u2028\nAids is now an epidemic\u2028\naffecting thousands of people worldwide. The disease is still incurable\u2028\nand the prospects for\u2028\nits control in the near future are\u2028\nstill very slim.\u2028\nAlthough Aids is a very recent\u2028\ndisease, nobody really knows\u2028\nwhere it came from. Not that\u2028\nsuch a knowledge would help alleviate the situation but, as with\u2028\nany other calamity which affects\u2028\nmankind, people always have this\u2028\nurge to unravel its origins.\u2028\nThere have been speculations\u2028\nand controversies concerning the\u2028\norgins of Aids and the virus\u2028\nwhich causes it.\u2028\nEarlier, rumours had it that\u2028\nthe Aids virus originated from\u2028\nAfrica, out of some weird interaction between the monkeys and\u2028\nhuman beings, The story maintained that since the human Aids\u2028\nvirus had some resemblance to\u2028\nthe monkey virus, some rural Africans must have acquired the virus from the monkeys through\u2028\nsome blood mixing.\u2028\nIt was hypotbesised that since\u2028\nsome rural Africans ate monkeys,\u2028\nthe monkey virus must have had\u2028\nan opportunity to infect man and\u2028\nevolve into a form capable of\u2028\ncausing Aids in man.\u2028\nThis hypothesis caused a lot of\u2028\nhostility and mistrust between its\u2028\npropagators and the majority of\u2028\nAfricans, as it opened old racial\u2028\nwounds which were thought to\u2028\nhave been healed. As it soon be\u2028\ncame clear that this African mon\u2028\nkeys affair would not help in\u2028\ncurbing Aids, en alternative theory about the origin of Aids came\u2028\nup.\u2028\nThis second theory claimed\nthat Aids virus was tailored in\u2028\nthe USA army germ warfare laboratories. The theory came as a\u2028\nrelief to many people who found\u2028\nthe earlier \u2018African monkey affairs\u2019 theory a bit uncomfortable.\u2028\nThe supporters of this theory\u2028\nbased their arguments on the fact\u2028\nthat the advanced scientific capabilities of the USA Laboratories\u2028\nwere almost unlimited.\u2028\n\u201cIf they can send people to the\u2028\nmoon and are now trying to patent genetically altered organisms,\u2028\nthen why can\u2019t they tailor a simple Aids virus in the laboratory?\u201d\u2028\nthe propagators asked.\u2028\nBut the question which remained in many people\u2019s minds\u2028\nwas the motive. Why make the\u2028\nvirus in the first place? Was it a\u2028\nconspiracy, a grand plan to eliminate some targeted enemies9\u2028\nIf there was a sinister motive\u2028\nthen why was the disease not tailored to spare its originators?\u2028\nAnother weakness with the germ warfare theory was its\u2028\ntestability. So it remained just\u2028\nanother wild speculation.\u2028\nNow the most recent theory is\u2028\nclaiming that. Aids could have\u2028\nbeen spread by polio vaccines in\u2028\nAfrica. In this years March and\u2028\nMay issues of Science, the weekly magazine of the American Association for the advancement of Science, there were strong debates about a controversial article originally written by Tom Curtis\u2028\nin the Rolling Stone magazine.\u2028\nThe article hypothesizes that\u2028\nthe Aids virus first entered\u2028\nhumans in Africa via an oral polio vaccine\u2028\nwidely administered in the\u2028\n1950\u2019s.\u2028\nAccording to the article,\u2028\nas-yet-undiscovered simian\u2028\nmonkey) form of HIV-I may\ncontaminated a polio vaccine\u2028\nmanufactured by Hilary\u2028\nKaprowski, a former director of\u2028\nWister Institute in Philadelphia,\u2028\nUSA. That virus, the article continues \u201cmight have come from\u2028\nthe monkey kidney cells which\u2028\nKaprowski grew.\u201d\u2028\nThe vaccine, we are further\u2028\ntold, \u201cwas tested in what is now\u2028\nRwanda, Zaire, and Burundi during the late 1950s where it was\u2028\nspray-injected into the mouths of\u2028\nseveral hundred thousand\u2028\npeople\u201d.\u2028\nTo corroborate these claims,\u2028\npositivity to HIV has been\u2028\nbe  \u201c in the former Congo\u2028\nRwanda, and Burundi where the injection was supposed\nto have been administered.\u2028\nIt is also in this region of central equatorial Africa \u201cwhere\u2028\nsome of the earliest Aids cases\u2028\nwere retrospectively identified by\u2028\nWestern blot and Enzyme Linked\u2028\nImmunosorbent Assay (ELISA),\u2028\nsays tom Curtis in a reply to his\u2028\ncritics contained in the May 1992\u2028\nissue of Science.\u2028\nTom Curtis\u2019 convincing story\u2028\nmay partly explain the earlier\u2028\nspeculations about the Aids\u2019 origin from the African monkeys,\u2028\nthis time bringing in the US lab\u2028\noratories link.\u2028\nAs the saying goes, where there\u2028\nis smoke, there is fire. This is\u2028\nprobably where the truth about\u2028\nthe origin of Aids will eventually\ncome from.\u2028\nThe Curtis story has caused so\u2028\nmuch debate that possible ways\u2028\nof testing his hypothesis have\u2028\nbeen considered.\u2028\nAccording to Cecil H. Fox, al8o\u2028\nin an article published in the May\u2028\n1992 issue of Science, serum\u2028\nsamples and vaccines from the\u2028\nperiod between 1952 and 1982\u2028\ncan be tested for the presence of\u2028\nimmunodeficiency viruses.\u2028\nThe Wister Institute has an\u2028\nnounced that it is forming a com\u2028\nmittee \u201cto evaluate the Rolling\u2028\nStone speculations.\u201d\u2028\nAccording to Thomas Folks,\u2028\nchief of CDC\u2019s retrovirus branch,\u2028\nCurtis\u2019 story is just a typical \u201cfragrant case of selective editing and\njournalistic malpractice.\u2019\u2028\nFolks charges that Curtis selectively ignored the epidemiologic\u2028\nand laboratory data he was offered against the poi\u00eco vaccine hypothesis.\u201d .\u2028\nto Gerald Quinnan Jr., deputy director of the food and drug administration branch that over sees vaccines, \u201cIt is not possible\u2028\nfor SIV (simian (monkey) immunodeficiency virus) to be present\u2028\nin polio vaccines in any substantial amount\u201d. Quinnan claims\u2028\nthat he deliberately tried to infect\u2028\nmonkey kidney cells with SIV\u2028\nand failed.\u2028\nAnd according to Kaprowaki,\u2028\nthe manufacturer of the original\u2028\nCongo vaccine, Curtis only chose\u2028\nto misconstrue the information\u2028\nand \u201cpropagate a hypothesis without basis\u2019.\u2028\nAfter the press had picked up\u2028\nthe hot Curtis story in the US,\u2028\nthe CDC (centers for Disease\u2028\nControl, USA) issued a terse\u2028\nstatement saying that \u201cthe\u2028\nweight o scientific evidence does\u2028\nnot support this idea and there in\u2028\nno more reason to believe this\u2028\nhypothesis than many others\u2028\nwhich have been considered and\u2028\nrejected on scientific grounds\u201d\u2028\nInterestingly, some Aids researchers seem to regard Curtis\u2028\nhypothesis favourably, though\u2028\nwith some reservations, SIV researcher Ronard Destosiera of\u2028\nthe New England regional research center says that \u201che\u2019s never heard a good reason why the\u2028\nhypothesis is not plausible.\u2028\nAmidst all these debates, Tom\u2028\nCurtis, the originator of the hypothesis has chosen to take a\u2028\nneutral stand. He argues that he was simply trying to prod researchers into examining a testable hypothesis.\u2028\nAs we Kenyans would rightly\u2028\nput it, we only hope that no stone\u2028\nwill remain unturned in the search for truth about the origins\u2028\nof the yet unstoppable Aids. Lets\u2028\njust wait and see."}
