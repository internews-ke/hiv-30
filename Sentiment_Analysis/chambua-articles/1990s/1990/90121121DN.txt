{"text": "Dec 11, 1990\n\nUganda grapples with the menace of Aids\nUganda is the only country in\nAfrica that has scientifically measured\nthe impact of Aids on her\ncountry. Furthermore, the level\nof awareness of the dangers of\nthe disease is unequalled on the continent.\nThis testimony was given by\nthe United Nations Children's\nFund (Unicef) cuuntry representative,\nSally Fegan Wyles.\nWyles, who chairs the Unicef\nWestern and Southern Africa Research\u2019s Committee on Aids has\nlived in Uganda for almost six\nyears. Her Kampala office spends\nUS$2 million annually in a five year\nprogramme on Aids.\nWyles attributes the level of\nawareness in Uganda to the government's\napproach to the problem.\n\"Uganda has been incredibly\nopen-minded and fore-sighted,\nready to tackle the Aids menace\nhead-on. From the beginning, the\ngovernment admitted that there\nwas a problem and did not hide\nthe statistics,\" says Wyles.\nWorld-wide, the World Health\nOrganisation (WHO) estimates\nthat up to this year, at least eight\nto 10 million adults are now infected\nwith HIV. Of these, 1.3 million are Ugandans.\nStatistics from Kampala indicate that 10 per cent of the aids\nvictims are children born to\nmothers who are HIV positive or\nare infected through blood transfusion.\nMost of the child victims\nare on 0-2 age cluster, 10 per cent\nin 3.5 years group and none in\nthe 5-14 group. The cases begin\nto increase at ages 17/18 and are\nat their peak at 24 years.\nKampala and Rakai District,\nabout 160 kilometres west of the\ncapital, are the worst hit areas in\nthe country. A survey conducted\nby UNICEF in six counties of\nRakai found out that there were\n26,000 orphaned children.\nThe whole district, is believed\nTo have about 40,000 orphans.\nWyles compares this figure to\nthat given by a joint survey of\nUnicef WHO in 10 African countries\nwhich gives an estimated\nfigure bt tween 5-6 million orphans\nby the year 2000.\n\"From what I have seen, that figure is very conservative and I\nCan say that the figure could easily be twice\n that,\" Wvles remarks.\nWyles's fear is supported by a\nNigerian physician, Prof M. Oyediran, who projected that by 1992 about one million African children will have been born to HIV infected mothers. She said about 25 per cent of the children were likely to be HIV infected and most of them would die of the disease. She said the remaining 750,000 children would have lost one or both parents.\nWyles believes that the Aids scourge will have two different impacts on the work of Unicef in the country. \"It will certainly reverse the impact made in reducing infant mortality from 200 to 169 in 1988.  But the positive impact is that it urges us to even do more to save the children who are not HIV positive dying from vaccine preventable diseases like whooping cough, tetanus, tuberculosis, diptheria, measles and polio.\"\nWyles admits that the problem of orphans is so immense and complex that no one agency can afford to embark on it alone. \"We try whenever possible to encourage local groups to develop their own plans and help the children within their own community rather than building big orphanages\".\nUnicef does not want the children 'Uprooted from the society so that when they are 18 years old,\nthey will not have land or any\nplace to belong to. Currently the\norganisation is helping local\ngroups with training so that they\ncan analyse the problems, identify\nthe projects and try to account\nfor assistance given.\nThe cost to assist the orphans\nis not known. But, according to\nWyles \"its multi-million dollars\nbecause it is not something for\none year but may be 15 years. We\nare talking _about supporting primary school children so that they do not encounter problems of\nschool fees, vocational training\nand sometimes very small children\nwho have to be provided\nwith pre-mixed food packages as\nthe grandmothers cannot cook\nenough for them, there is also the\nprovision of health services.\n\"There is no way Unicef is going\nto get such large sums of\nmoney,\" concedes Wylell, adding,\n\"what we have to do is to try to\nsee who is interested to help\".\nShe says already there are donors\nurging Unicef to put a\nprogramme together for funding.\nThree years ago, Unicef initiated\na science syllabus with 50 per cent covering health issues including\nAids, and helped to training\nteachers to handle science subjects. Wyles notes that teachers\ndo not have a very high level\nof education and 60 pel' cent are\nuntrained because teachers' salaries\nare generally low.\nHowever, through primary.\nschool system, Ugandan children\nof today and parents of tomorrow\nare learning about simple low cost\nmeans of preventing diseases\nand promoting healthy\nbehaviour.\n\"They talk about these things before they get involved in sex.  It\nis much easier to mould their\nbehaviour rather than talking to\nadults who have already got a\npattern of behaviour,\" Wyles points out.\nAnother Aids programme, but\nwhich is not equally as big, is to\ntry to talk to adults through the\nvarious channels of communications\nincluding person-to-person\nin groups.\n\"These talks do not only involve\nsaying that Aids is spread\nby sex but what are the pressures\nin the society that might make\none lead or behave in any way\nthat is risky,\"-Wyles explains.\nWyles stresses: \"In Uganda we\ndo not entertain this nonsense of\nsaying that Aids is spread by\nprostitutes, it is a much more\ncomplex problem, a network of\nrelationship going on all the\ntime.\"\nShe, in a way, blames scientists\nand to some extent, journalists\nwho spent much time in the early\n1980s trying to find a scapegoat\nfor the origin of Aids. \"From the\nbeginning, the disease manifested\nitself as a human catastrophe and\nwe should have started working\non it instead of apportioning blame"}
