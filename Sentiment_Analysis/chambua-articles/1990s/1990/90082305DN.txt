{"text": "Doctor: Aids to hurt Africa\nBy Nation correspondent \nThe director-general of the African\nMedical and Research Foundation (Amref), Dr Michael Gerber, said yesterday agricultural and industrial production in Africa was bound to be affected by the scourge of the dreaded Aids disease.\nDuring an Amref/American foundation for Aids Research (Amfar) workshop at the Jacaranda hotel, Nairobi, Dr Gerber said Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (Aids) continued to\nrise in African countries.\nIn Africa he said, the very\nyoung, the old, the sick and the\ndisabled, who are totally dependent\non the extended family,\ncould lose their livelihood if the '\nepidemic was not controlled.\nDr Gerber said the disease had\nreduced the supply. of trained\nmanpower in most African countries.\n\"A sample of workers in a\ncentral African mining town taken\na few years ago showed 68 per\ncent of skilled male workers tested\npositive for HIV (Human Immune-\ndeficiency Virus)\n\"Many work away from their\nfamilies and indulge in casual sex or visit female workers,\" he said.\nDr Gerber said the Aids epidemic\ncould affect both the local\nand foreign exchange earnings\nand international commodity\nprices unless ,governments in\nAfrica allocated more resources\nto its management.\nWhereas deaths from Aids in\u00b7\nwestern countries occurred\namong the sexually active people\nin the 20 to 45 age group, in\nAfrica, it occurred within the 15-\n45 age group.\nHe added that the mortality rate in Africa was bound to increase \"several-fold\" among \u00b7the economically, and most socially productive age groups.\n\"Given the subsistence, labour intensive agriculture in many African countries, food production may be significantly reduced,\" he said.\nThe Amref boss said he was\nconcerned about the possibility of .\nthe disease being transmitted .\nthrough breastfeeding. However,\nhe said the risk did not outweigh\nthe benefits of breastfeeding.\nHe said Amref would initiate a\nmajor programme in South\nNyanza focusing on women and children\u2019s health. The region has a very high infant mortality rate.\nThe facilitator of the, workshop, Dr David Nyamwaya, said the discovery of Kemron might\nlead to a lot of complacency among the people who should otherwise, be cautious infected\".\n\nMr Nyamwaya called, on people.,\nto be careful.
