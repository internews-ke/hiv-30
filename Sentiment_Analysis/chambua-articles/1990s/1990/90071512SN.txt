{"text": "Inside\nUganda,\nit's a new\nlifestyle\nBy MARK KIWANUKA\nOne of the significant aspects\nOf the Aids scare in Uganda is\nthe dramatic change it has\nimposed on people's life\nstyles. All classes of people\nhave been affected.\nyoung and the old, the\nand the poor, the educated\nand semi-literates- irrespective of sex.\nThe manner in which men\nspend their evenings, for example,\nhas drastically\nchanged. Gone are the good old-\ndays when men, both\nmarried and unmarried,\nwaited for long hours in bars\nand night clubs to pick up\nbar-maids or prostitutes for a\ngood time.\nNow men go to bars to\nspend a couple of hours\ndrinking alone or. with their\nwives. There is not a single\nnight club operating in the\nweekdays and the one or two\nthat operate at weekends are\nmainly patronised by\nagers and a small number\nadult men.\nIt is now no longer an asset\nfor a bar owner to employ\nbeautiful girls in order to attract\ncustomers. In fact,\nmany bars have switched to\nemploying men to serve as\nwaiters.\nOn the part of women, they\nhave lost the easy life where\nthey could afford to work for\nalmost nothing as bar-maid\nand depend on men who pay\nthem handsomely for services\nrendered\" after work.\nSimilarly, women can no\nlonger depend on the world's\noldest profession to earn a\nliving. The old prostitutes\nhave had to look for fresh\navenues of employment.\nConsequently, young girls\nand middle aged women have\nflooded the markets to sell all\ntype of items - used clothes,\nvegetables, food ~\nwhich had been the joyed\nonly elderly and ugly women.\nAlso squeezed out of existence\nis the business of lodges\nwhich used to offer special\nservices to people seeking accommodation specifically for\nsexual purpose. Many have\n,been turned into rooms\nfor monthly hire.\nThe Aids scourge has also\nhad effect on young men and\nwomen by creating a situation\nwhere early marriage is\nthe best insurance policy\nagainst contracting the deadly\ndisease through haphazard\nsexual relations."}
