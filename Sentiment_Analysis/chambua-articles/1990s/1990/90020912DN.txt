{"text": "Kemri's ties with local\nHerbalists explained\nLocal herbalists have given\nonly 1,500 samples of traditional\nherbs to the Kenya Institute\nof Medical Research\n(KEMRI) and not 45,000\nsamples as alleged by some of\nthem ..\nThe director of Keinri's\nTraditional Medicines and\nDrugs Research Centre, Dr\nKofi Tsekpo, told a special\npress conference in Nairobi\nyesterday that the institute\nhad dealings with 20 traditional\nmedicine practitioners.\nDr Tsekpo was explaining\nto the Press on how the traditional\nmedicine centre functions\nand its relationship\nwith herbalists.\nThe conference was attended\nby four: herbalists who are\nco-operating with the centre.\nThe director said that no\none could rob a genuine traditional\nherbalist of his\nmedicine.\n\"We try to inform herbalists\n, about the possible dangers that\n, may be in their drugs Unfortunately\nsome of them do not\npossess any letter of acknowedgement\nfrom us about the receipt  of samples of their of how their medicine works.\"\nHe said that the criteria to be\nmet by drugs to be administered\nto humans include purity, safety\nand identity of plants because\nsubstances from certain poisonous\nplants cannot be used.\nThere is no traditional herb\nthat can cure AIDS up to now\nalthough we have a keen interest\nin herbal treatment of such\ncondition.\nHe said that the controversial\nherbalist from western Kenya,\nMr Hudson Lubanga, had attempted\nto send a bag to the\ncentre which he claimed contained\nAids herbs \"but the procedure\nrequires that such be handed\nin person and the herbalist\ninterviewed before his goods are\naccepted\".\n\nDr Ksekpo said that the centre\nhad highly qualified researchers\nwith a minimum of a master degrees\nwho have skills in identifying\ngenuine herbalists.\n\"We don't just go with what\nthey tell us or what they bring\nhere. We actually follow them up\nat a later date to see whether they\nare at least known to the community\nas herbalists.\" he added\nDr Ksepko said' that the centre\nHelped genuine herbalists \"who\nare not among those who shouted\nloudest\".\n\nAids: Scientists claim success\nResearchers in Europe are claiming\nthey are about to make a major\nbreakthrough in finding an effective\ntreatment for the Human\nImmunodeficiency Virus (HIV)\nwhich causes Aids.\nIn Belgium, reseachers claim\nthat they have identified new\nanti-viral substances which can\nbe used to interfere with an enzyme\nthat is essential to the survival\nof the virus.\nDr Rudi Pauwels. from the Rega Institute of Medical Research,\nclaims that the new antiviral\ncompounds codenamed\nTIBO can block an enzyme and\ntherefore stop the virus from\nmultiplying. However, critics say\nthat the compounds is similar to\nothers which have been developed\nsuch as DDC and DOI,\nwhich could be used' to block an\nenzyme called Reverse\nTranscriptase which slows the\n--replication ,of the virus. None of these compounds have\nproduced dramatic results like\nthe ones obtained by KEMRI researchers\nwho developed KEMRON.\nKEMRON eliminated fatal\nAids symptoms in at least 101\npatients. '\nThe efficacy of the drug.\nshocked many observers world\nwide, who believed an Aids drogs\ncould not come from a developing\ncountry."}
