{"text": "The doubting Thomases\nDESPITE THE PUBLICITY, THOUSANDS BELIEVE IT'S ALL PROPAGANDA\nOthers claim a Kemron tablet\ntaken before and after sex\nprevents Aids infection\nBy CHEGE wa GACHAMBA\nShe looked straight into my face and\nshouted above the din: \"I have been\noperating from here long before you\npeople started writing about that disease.\nIf there really was that thing you call\nAids, how come none of my colleagues has\ndied from it?\"\nThat hit me like a thunderbolt. And before I had\neven recovered from the jolt and digested the full\nmeaning of that remark, she added: \"I have never\nfor one single moment thought there is anything\nlike Aids. It's all Government propaganda.\"\nAnd did she take health precautions into consideration\nwhen picking her men or did she just\npocket the Sh150 and hope for the best?, I asked.\n\"I do take some precautions. But that is because\nof the other sexually transmitted diseases which\nare a nuisance and can periodically put one out of\nbusiness. I don't think about Aids,\" she said.\nShe was on the beat at a popular 24-hour nightclub\nin Nairobi. She was holding a beer. But she\nwas not drunk. As we talked, her trained eye kept\ndarting to faces of men milling around the rowdy\nbar. Perhaps, she was trying to pick out prospective\ncustomers.\nShocking as it may sound, that is what the\nprostitute said about' the' dreaded -disease.\n~ And she is not the only one who thinks like this despite all the massive countrywide campaign\non Aids and Kemron and the fact that 9,139 'Kenyans\nhad developed Aids by May and that there\nmay be 200,000 healthy carriers of the incurable\ndisease ..\nThousands of wananchi apparently think such\nfigures and the accompanying Aids campaign is all\nGovernment family planning propaganda, while\nthe drug is a sales gimmick of some commercial minded scientists.\n\"They just want to make money,\" said another\nwoman whose boyfriend allegedly died of Aids.\n\"Hut here I am alive and well. Frankly, I don't\nthink there is anything like Aids,\" she said.\nThat is what another man who requested anonymity\nthought until it killed his own brother. The\nman who says he had never stopped \"doing what a\nman should do naturally,\" watched helplessly as\nhis brother, a long-distance driver withered his\nway into the grave. I am now scared of women.\" To many, the disease would have to hit someone\nvery close before the message about its existence\nsinks home.\nBut for a man who simply identified himself as\nDan, it took a video story of the late Philly Bongoley\nLutaya, the Ugandan musician who embarked\non a countrywide anti-Aids campaign after testing\nHIV positive, to convince him that he had been\ntrending where the eagles dared.\nA self-confessed playboy who changed girls faster than he refuelled his car, Dan says he is now a\nchanged man.\n\"Since I saw that video last month, I feel safer\ngoing home alone or with my regular girl-friend\nafter a night out at a disco, Kemron or no Kemron,\"\nhe says.\nWhile launching Kemron on July 27, President\nMoi urged Kenyans to follow the precautionary\nguidelines issued by the Ministry of Health to\nprotect themselves from the disease. He cautioned wananchi against loose morals because\nthe anti-Aids drug developed at the Kenya I\nMedical Research Institute was not an all-out-curefor\nthe dreaded disease.\nBut asked what she thinks of Kemron, a young\nfemale dancer in a Nairobi disco which is popular\nwith prostitutes says: \"Hiyo si ni dawa ya\nukimwi?\" (Isn't that the anti-Aids drug?).\nWell, but how does one use it? \"Unameza moja\nkabla ya ... na ingine baadaye, na hautashikwa\nna ukimwi.\" (Swallow one before and one after,\nand you won't catch Aids).\nShe had heard many radio programmes on the\ndreaded disease and her boss had often warned her.\nagainst getting lured by many men. So she\nthought Aids was real.\nBut with the arrival of Kemron, all was fine, she\nthought.\nA twilight colleague of hers who operates from\nthe same club said diseases like gonorrhoea can\nreally affect business. But Aids just stays in the\nbody and one may not notice it until ten years\nlater. Well if I die then, my children will be ten\nyears older and able to fend for themselves,\" says\nthis mother of four.\nShe too has her reasons for doubting the existence\nof Aids. \"How come they never show us Aids\npatients in mwananchi-oriented anti-Aids campaign\npublic baraza or in hospitals?\"\nShe however admits never having read stories of\nTURN TO PAGE 24\nMany twilight girls claim Aids does not exist and Kemron is just a commercial ploy."}
