{"text": "WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 5, 1990\n\n\nDoubting Thomases and the Kemron drug\n\n FROM PAGE 13  \n\nSuch HIV positives as 'Joe Muriuki and the late\nBongoley, who courageously ignored possible social\nstigma and came out to tell their story hoping\nIt would help save others.\nTalking of the precautions she takes to avoid\u00b7\nThe venereal diseases, she says she prefers her men\nWearing condoms. The rubbers are on sale at the\nClub for Shl0 each. \"But if they run out of supply,\nI won't let my children starve,\" she says..\nOne thing she emphasizes is that her men have\nTo undergo a kind of visual inspection.\n\"I like them removing their clothes while the\nLights are still on. There are some diseases which\ncan be visually detected. Then I will say 'no!.' If\nthey refuse- to take off their clothes while the\nlights are on, I will also say 'no!' and refund the\nmoney,\" she says.\nBut how effective her sight and sense of judgment can be late in the night when she is most\nlikely not only tired but also drunk and broke is\nanother thing all together .....\nIronically, despite the on going massive anti-aids\ncampaign, one would have generally expected the\nwananchi to be more cautious about sexually\ntransmitted diseases. But this is not so .\nA doctor who' runs a private clinic along River\nRoad, which is popular with venereal disease patients\nsays he has been treating increasingly more\nSTD cases than was the case in the past.\nAccording to Prof J. Oliech, the Director of\nMedical Services, the level of awareness about\nAids has increased in the country but behaviours\nhave not changed.\nHe says some of the emerging anti-Aids drugs\nincluding Kemron are welcome and give an added\ndimension in treatment in Aids patients. However\nprevention is more important than the drugs because\nthe disease has no cure yet.\nProf Oliech recently told a consultative workshop\non Aids management for senior health officials in Nairobi Province that further research and\nstudies on Kemron were still going on and plan&\nwere underway for an expanded clinical study and\nuse of Kemron.\nHe said the highest number of Aids cases come\nfrom Coast, Nairobi and Nyanza provinces in that\norder while up to four per cent of blood donors in\nsome high prevalence areas test positive.\nThe director of Kenyatta National Hospital, Dr\nNelson Agata, says up to 70 per cent of Aids cW\nare of people in their most productive .ages. \"\nis linked with high risk behaviour. Its occurrence I\nhigh in people regularly contracting sexually\ntransmitted diseases,\" he said.\nDr Agata says that \"over 40 per cent of tuberculosis\npatients also have Aids.\nPrecautionary guidelines issued by the Ministry\nof Health say sticking to only one partner, the so\ncalled \"zero-grazing\" is the only effective \"vaccine\"\nagainst Aids. However use of condoms may\nalso reduce chances of infection but this is not\nfool-proof.\nIn fact, in some Western countries, men preferring\nnot to use condoms are charged much more\nby the prostitutes. However, Waithira says that\ndoes not apply to her.\nAids is mainly transmitted through sex. It can\nalso be passed on through blood transfusion or in\ncases where such blood-stained tools like needles,\nshaving machines, traditional circumcisers' knives\nete are used before being sterilized.\nPerhaps the most horrifying aspect of the disease\nis that, the possibility of proper diagnosis in\nthe early stages are still very slim. Experts say the\nvirus could spend as many as ten years before it\nbroke down the body's defense mechanism.'\nAnd when that happens, woe unto the doubting\nThomases. Dr Davy Koech and Prof Arthur Obel,\nthe scientists who developed Ke\"1.l1!un\u00b7Bll.\"YK,emron\nmay give Aids sufferers the best chance available\nbut it is not yet a cure.\""}
