{"text": "February 1, 1990\n\n55 anti-Aids drugs tried but only AZT is selling\n\nBy CATHERINE ARNST,LONDON, Wednesday\n\nIn the nine years since Aids was\nfirst identified, the pharmaceutical\nindustry has developed some\n55 drugs for the deadly disease.\nBut, despite the hundreds of\nmillions of dollars spent on research,\nonly one drug treatment,\n.AZT (Azidothymidine), has been\nlicensed for Acquired Immune\nDeficiency Syndrome, and it\ncosts each patient at least $3,400\n(Sh71,400) a year.\nThe rest are still in various\nphases of testing. Once licensed,\nmedical researchers said they will\nprobably be taken in conjunction.\nwith AZT, in the sort of drug\n\"cocktails\" now used to treat\ncancer.\nConsequently Welcome PLC,\nthe company that makes AZT, is\nat the centre of a social and medical\ncontroversy. Aids-victims\npicket Well come in protest at the.\nhigh price of the drug, and doctors\nworry about the serious side\neffects that it can cause.\nIndustry analysts expect the\nBritish pharmaceutical' giant to\nremain at the eye of the storm for\nthe next three to four years, as no\ndrug treatment now being tested\nappears to be as effective against\nAids as AZT, trade named\nRetrovir, \nRetrovir only delays the\nprogress of Aids in the body, and\npatients in the acute stages of the\ndisease cannot take it for more\nthan 18 months without developing\nacute anemia.\nStudies released in August\nshowed that AZT was much less\ntoxic for people who were infected\nwith the Aids virus but had\nnot yet developed symptoms,\nmaking the drug more tolerable\nfor a larger group of people.\nBut recently, Welcome scientists\nfound that certain strains of\nHIV, the virus that causes Aids,\nare becoming resistant to AZT,\nand rats exposed to high dosages\nof the drug developed vaginal\ncancer ..\nNo drug under development\nholds out the promise of a cure,\nand medical experts say it will be\n10 years before a vaccine is\ndeveloped.\nIn the meantime, Aids sufferers\ncan expect more expensive\ndrugs, all with their own set of\nside effects, and the prospect of a\nlifelong drug maintenance\nprogamme that will keep them\n. alive but not healthy.\n\"Retrovir is fairly secure as the\n\"gold standard\" for Aids drugs\nfor the next four to five years,\"\nsaid Mr Erling Refsum, who follows\nthe drug industry for Nomura\nResearch.\n\"There will be a lot of drugs\ncoming through that will challenge\nit, but all will be compared\nto AZT, and effectiveness will always\nbe more important than\nprice.\" ..\nFew observers expect any Aids\ntreatment to be cheaper than\nAZT. Wellcome cut 'the price\nfrom $8,000 to $6,400 last September,\nand earlier this month\nthe US Government approved a\nlower dosage, effectively cutting\nthe cost of treatment to $3,400 a\nyear .\u2022\nDevelopment costs are high for\nany drug, but Aids presents a\nparticularly difficult target because\nit destroys the body's entire\nimmune system. Victims can contract\neverything from the rarest\nforms of cancer to pneumonia.\nIn addition, the spread of the\ndisease is nowhere near the magnitude\nof such killers as cancer\nand heart disease.\nThe World Health\nOrganization estimates that five\n\nto 10 million people may be infected with the HIV virus worldwide.\nHowever, only some\n600,000 full-blown aids victims\nhave been identified, about half\nof whom have died, so the base of\nusers for any Aids drug - other\nthan a vaccine - is small.\n\"The pricing of other drugs will\nbe similar to AZT,\" said Mr Andrew\nPorter, a drug industry analyst\nwith Nikko Securities Co in\nLondon. \"It costs more than $100\nmillion to develop a drug and\ncompanies .have to recoup that\ninvestment.\"\nAids drugs under development\ngenerally fall into three\ncategories:\n.Antiviral, like Retrovir,\nwhich interfere with the biological\nprocesses that allow the Aids\nvirus to replicate in the body.\n.Immune stimulators, which\nact to boost the body's natural\nimmune system, so that it can\nprotect the body from the many\ndiseases that result from the\nvirus.\n.Vaccines which block the virus\nfrom either progressing in the\nbody or, ideally, from entering\nthe body' at all.\nThe next drug to win a license\nis expected to be DDI\n'(Dideoxyinosine), trade named\nVidex, and made by the US drug\ncompany Bristol-Myers Co. Like\nRetrovir, DDl is an antiviral and\nhighly toxic.\nAlthough Videx has undergone\nno clinical trials, in September\nthe United States approved the\ndrug only for Aids patients who\nare seriously ill and unable to tolerate\nRetrovir. Aids researchers\nsaid that ideally, AZT and DDl\nshould be used in rotation to\nminimize their respell' e\ntoxicities ..\nHoffman la Roche GS of Switzerland has a similar drug in clinical\ntrials, DDC\n(Dideoxycytidine), and there\nhave been promising' reports on a\ncompound drug called Carbovir,\nunder development by Glaxo\nHoldings PLC of Britain.\nThe immune stimulator that\nhas shown the most promise is\nImuthiol, the trade name for\nDiethyldithiocarbauiate, made by\nFrance's Rhone-Poulenc. The\ndrug has long been used in\nFrance to treat cancer and a similar\ndrug, Ant abuse, is sold in the\nUnited States for the treatment\u00b7\nof alcoholism.\nFrench researchers said in\nOctober, 1988, that Imuthiol\ncurbed symptoms of Aids in patients\nwho carry the HIV virus\nbut have not yet developed the\ndisease.\n. But their study came under attack for using too small a\npie of patients and lasting only\nweeks. The medical community is\nnow awaiting the results of an\nextensive clinical trial of\nImuthiol recently completed in\nthe United States.\nThere are only a handful of\nvaccines being tested, and they\nonly block the virus once it enters\nthe body.\nIn December, US researchers\nreported the development of the\nfirst vaccine that actually protected\nmonkeys from getting the\nvirus.\nThe researchers said in a report:\n\"Our success is unambiguous\nproof that a vaccine for Aids is\npossible.\" Their research points\nto the direction for development\nof a human vaccine. But medical\n. experts almost universally agree\nthat such a vaccine is some 10\nyears away. (Reauters)\u2028"}
