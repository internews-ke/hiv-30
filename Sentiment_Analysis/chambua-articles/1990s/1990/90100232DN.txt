{"text": "October 2, 1990\n\nHIV-positive mothers:\u2028\n: Case for unborn child\u2028\nA University of Nairobi pediatrician recently suggested that HIV\u2028\npositive mothers be routinely aborted to save the children the agony of\u2028\nbeing born HIV-positive. In today\u2019s edition, DOROTHY MUNY\u2028\nYAKHO likens this proposal to the eugenics programme, which had so\u2028\nmany German children exterminated just because they did not conform to that day\u2019s standards of perfection.\n\n\nAt a recent medics\u2019 workshop on\u2028\nthe management of HIV/Aids, a\u2028\nUniversity of Nairobi pediatrician recommended routine testing and aborting of mothers who\u2028\nturn out to be carriers of the\u2028\nhuman immunodeficiency virus\u2028\n(HIV) that causes the killer Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome (Aids) disease.\u2028\nThe argument given for routine\u2028\ntesting and abortion of HIV-positive mothers is that the mothers\u2028\nwould die, and the orphaned baby\u2028\nwould suffer possible abandonment arising from the stigma of\u2028\nAids. And if indeed the baby does\u2028\nturn out to be HIV-positive, he\u2028\nwould, of course progress to full-\u2028\nblown Aids and die, so, why not\u2028\nopt for abortion and shorten the\u2028\nagony for both the mother and\u2028\nthe baby?\u2028\nThere is a 25 to 50 per cent\u2028\nchance that a child born to an\u2028\nHIV-positive mother will be\u2028\nHIV-positive. Although the majority of babies born to HIV-positive mothers test positive at\u2028\nbirth, a good percentage of them\u2028\nconvert to negative between\u2028\n18 and 24 months of are. The\u2028\nexplanation is that their \u2028\npositive status is a result of maternal anti-bodies floating in\u2028\ntheir bloodstream, These eventually die off resulting in the child\u2028\nconverting to HIV-negative\u2028\nstatus.\u2028\nThe implication of this is that\u2028\nthe pediatrician\u2019s recommendation to abort HIV-positive mothers is fraught with the danger of\u2028\ncondemning innocent and perfectly normal babies to death just\u2028\nbecause they happen to be in the\u2028\nwombs of HIV-positive mothers.\u2028\nToday\u2019s article is not an argument in favour of those children,\u2028\nwho though born testing positive\u2028\nfor Aids may de-convert at a later\u2028\nstage; it is a look at the whole\u2028\nabortion mentality and its relationship to euthanasia, which has\u2028\nrecently featured quite prominently in the local press.\u2028\nAbortion and euthanasia have\u2028\none thing in common: Both practices infringe upon the human\u2028\nrights to life, and introduce into\u2028\nmodern day law the principle of\u2028\ndirectly killing the innocent as a\u2028\nsolution to problems.\u2028\nAccording to Dr Peter Doherty\u2028\nin Euthanasia, License to \u2028\ngenuinely voluntary euthanasia is\u2028\nimpossible for those living in\u2028\nfamily circumstances. \u201cThrough\u2028\nthe family, human love is ex\u2028\npressed in terms of life in that\u2028\nthe parents\u2019 love is expressed\u2028\nboth for each other and to their\u2028\nchildren. It is on the basis of se\u2028\ncure love that family bonds and\u2028\nloyalty are nurtured and mutual\u2028\ndevotion is developed between\u2028\nmembers of the family. When\u2028\nmisfortune strikes, as indeed it\u2028\neventually does, there is a rallying of forces for mutual support.\u2028\nBy their support towards each\u2028\nother, the family bonds are\u2028\nstrengthened\u201d he says.\u2028\nKenyans have a long tradition\u2028\nof extended family, and a mother\u2028\nwho is dying from Aida, should\u2028\nfind among her sisters or other\u2028\nmembers of the family one who\u2028\nwill be willing to look after the\u2028\nchild that the deceased leaves\u2028\nbehind.\u2028\nBut then we are talking of a\u2028\nnew era of convenience, an era of\u2028\nsituational ethics, when there are\u2028\nno absolute evils like thou shalt\u2028\nnot kill, but rather, you may kill\u2028\nif the tile involved is not of equal\u2028\nworth to what human Life should\u2028\nbe.\u2028\nJoseph Fletcher, the father of\u2028\nsituational ethics once said in the\u2028\nAmerican Journal of Nursing\u2028\nthat it was \u201cridiculous\u201d to give\u2028\nethical approval to the ending of\u2028\na \u201csubhuman life\u201d by abortion\u2028\nwhile refusing to give approval to\u2028\nending of a \u2019subhuman\u2019 life by\u2028\npositive euthanasia.\u2028\n\u201cIf we are morally obliged to\u2028\nput an end to a pregnancy when\u2028\namniocentesis reveals a terribly\u2028\ndefective foetus, we are equally\u2028\nobliged to put an end to a patient\u2019s hopeless misery, when a\u2028\nbrain scan reveals that a patient\u2028\nwith cancer has advanced brain\u2028\nmetastases,\u201d he said.\u2028\nA fortnight ago in this column,\u2028\nwe carried an article on the\u2028\nNairobi Terminal Care Centre,\u2028\nwhose very existence is a challenge to the euthanasia mentality\u2028\nthat is slowly creeping Into Kenyans\u2019 way of thinking. A society\u2028\nis measured by the care and attention it gives to its most helpless members. Only the society\u2028\nwhich bases a man\u2019s worth on his\u2028\nusefulness will prefer to give him\u2028\na cheap death instead of \u2028\nsupport in living out his L.\u2028\ngenuine dignity.\u2028\nMost abortion is practised\u2028\nsuit the mother\u2019s convenience\u2028\nsince advances in modern medicine have relegated abortion\u2028\nsave the mother\u2019s life to \u2028\narchives.\u2028\nWhere abortion is carried\u2028\n\u201cfor the sake of the child\u201d ai\u2028\nthe Aids example under\u2028\nit is also known as pre\u2028\neuthanasia. The thinking li\u2028\nthis form of euthanasia is L...\u2028\nare asking whether this child\u2028\nan intact enough mind and L..\u2028\nto justify his continued life.\u2028\nAs Dr Jack and Mrs Barbara\u2028\nWilike, experts in human sexuality say in their book Handbook\u2028\non Abortion, \u201cthe price tag on\u2028\nthe life of this unborn child, the\u2028\njustification for allowing him to\u2028\nlive and to be born, is whether or\u2028\nnot he will prove independent,\u2028\nenough, intelligent enough, and\u2028\nuseful enough to society to allow\u2028\nhim to live.\u201d\u2028\nA opposed to maternal cautions for abortion, this ju rit\u2028\nsays that a human life should n\u2028\nbe permitted to continue to live\u2028\nit does not measure up to a certain degree of physical and mental perfection and/or is not independent and useful to those\u2028\naround him, including the state\u2028\nThe ideology is frightening\u2028\nso far it calls to mind Hitler\u2019\u2028\neugenics programme. Contrary\u2028\ncommon belief that the \u2028\ndoctors only did what \u2028\nwanted them to do, the euthanasia prograRmme to \u201cpurify\u201d the\u2028\nGerman race was a creation of\u2028\nphysicians, who implemented it\u2028\nvoluntarily. .\u2028"}
