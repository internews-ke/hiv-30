{"text": "FEBRUARY 23, 1990\n\nPopulation, debt:\n\nThe trouble spots Per cent of the country\u2019s GNP, an increase of 25 per cent on 1980.\u2028\nWhile this was less than that of 22 other sub-Saharan African countries, it was a high burden for any country to bear. Kenya stands up well in the field of education and health care compared with other African countries and has one of the best statistics of nurses per population, but there is still only one doctor per 10,100 people.\u2028\nIn 1987, the Kenyan Government spent 23.1 per cent of its expenditure on education, 6.6 per cent on health and 9.1 per cent on the military. One of the country\u2019s biggest concerns is the rapid increase in deforestation, which is now the seventh highest in sub-Saharan Africa with the loss -of 67,000 hectares of forest a year. The World Bank report praises Kenya\u2019s attempt to diversify its production away from primary products, such as coffee and tea, and in particular into horticulture. \u201cProductive land In Kenya has become scarce relative to the growing supply of Labour,\u201d the report states. \u201cIn this situation, horticultural cultivation, by making intensive use of both land arid Labour, is highly appropriate. It employed about 20 per cent of the Labour force (1.8 million people) during the harvest season and it provides small scale landholders with an additional source of incomes and improved food security. \u201cKenya, which had almost no flower exports. 15 years ago, is now the world\u2019s fourth largest exporter of flowers. Roses; orchids and carnations are the most popular.\u201d Kenya\u2019s breweries also receive praise for their efforts to move from exports to neighbouring countries to overseas markets. The World Bank says that African entrepreneurs will be able to increase their export markets the more easily they can travel and transfer their foreign exchange earnings, but whether this will happen after 1992 and the Single Market in Europe is open to doubt. One of the country\u2019s biggest success stones, the World Bank says, is in the field of small enterprises. \u201cIn the past decade, employ merit in Kenya\u2019s urban informal sector has been growing rapidly. \u201cThe growth of this sector has been the main factor holding down increases in open urban Source: World Bank data. Unemployment.\u201d In the 1970s, Kenya opened its transport sector to competition, with the result that matatus were recognized and allowed to organize an association to represent their interests. But this was banned recently when matatu drivers attempted to raise fares above the ceilings set by the Government.\u2028\nThe Government has made sustained progress in encouraging small-scale manufacturing and the repair enterprises known as Jua Kali. Simple sheds equipped with power, water, public telephones and rest rooms have been established through the support of the Government, NGOs and local banks. \u201cBy providing essential infrastructure while maintaining in-formal linkages and proximity to local markets, the Government is enabling small-scale manufacture and repair services to organize produce r or savings co-operatives to improve their access to capital and technology,\u201d the report states. The ability that Kenya has to attract hundreds of thousands of foreign tourist because of its ataxic political environment also receives praise, although the report warns that \u201cconsiderable resources should be attracted to ensure the protection of the environment\u201d. \u2028\nThe World Bank Warns that one of the biggest threats to Africa\u2019s future survival is Aids, which \ncould devastate the young educated population in sub-Saharan Africa. The World \u2018Health\nOrganization estimates that more than a million people in Africa are affected by the HIV virus and that 30 per cent of these will devolve into Aids cases in a few years.\u2018 The countries most affected are Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda and Zaire.\u2028\n\u201cThe treatment of Aids patients will increase demand on weak health-care systems in the countries to which it spreads,\u201d the report warns. \u201cTo combat Aids, resource likely to be diverted from treatment and control of other important diseases. Different models show the death rate rising from 20 to 100 per cent in between two and three decades.\u201d\nThe World Bank says that apart from increased pan-African and regional trade co-operation, African countries should do far more to investigate mineral extraction. \u201cAfrica is well endowed with minerals and so far only a fraction of this wealth has been extracted,\u201d the report states. But above all, the World Bank states that the 4-5 per cent growth rate that African countries need to develop must be sustainable and equitable.\u2028\n\u201cTo ensure Africa\u2019s future welfare, the next generation must first build solid foundations for sustainable and equitable growth: Sustainable because care must be taken to protect the reductive capacity of the environment and equitable because this condition both for politic -ability and ultimately for sustained growth.\u201d\n\nPopulation, debt: The trouble spots From PAUL REDF\u00c8RN, NATION Staff Correspondent,\nLONDON Kenya is one of the few countries to emerge with any credit from the World Bank\u2019s report of the sub- Saharan African economies, but the warning signs are there for the future. There are only nine countries in sub-Saharan Africa which have shown a percentage growth in GNP of two per cent or more since 1965. They include Kenya. But during the 1980-87 period, the Kenyan economy had a negative growth of 0.9 per cent. The decrease in growth was not unique to Kenya, with 21 other African countries showing a negative growth rate greater than one percent, but it was a bad shock to a country that had experienced considerable growth be1ore.1\u2019or Kenya, the most worrying areas are the continued population expansion and the increasing debt. The country now has the highest percentage of children under five in sub-Saharan Africa. Although the population increase is now starting to decline, the country\u2019s population is predicted to use to 37 million by the end of the decade, 15 million more than at present.\u2028"}
