{"text": "Doctors' finding deepens Aids origin mystery\nLONDON, Friday\nMedical researchers have concluded that a British sailor who died in 1959 had the Aids virus,\nindicating the disease was present in Britain more than 20 years earlier than the first thought.\nThree researchers at the medical school at the University of Manchester in northern land reported their findings in the Lancet, a London-based\nweekly medical journal. The report, made available today was based on tests on tissue preserved\nfrom the Royal Navy sailor's body. According to the report, the sailor had an immune deficiency\nthat at the time could not be explained,\nas well as pneumocystis pneumonia, one of the Opportunistic diseases associated with Aids.\nThe Times of London, in an interview with one of the team virologist Andrew S. Bailey, said it was not until 1981 that US researchers writing in the New England Journal of medicine described the first case of a then newly recognised disease that was soon to become known as Aids.\nAids, or Acquired Immune Defiency Syndrome, breaks down the body's \"immune system, leaving\nvictims susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers.\nIt is usually transmitted through sexual contact, blood transfusions or infected needles. There is\nno known cure.\nHIV, or Human Immunodeficiency Virus, is the name of the Aids virus.\nThe Times quoted Mr Bailey as saying: \"Taking into account the incubation time of several years between infection and development of the full-blown disease,\nthe seaman would have contracted the virus in the early 1950s.\" Mr Bailey said this raised questions about the early prevalence of the disease.\n\"It also demolishes the idea held by some people that the Aids virus could have been a manmade,\ngenetically engineered organism released accidentally or deliberately from the laboratory,\"\nBailey was Quoted as saying.\n\"His (the sailor's) death happened long before the technology for genetic manipulation had been developed.\"\nThe new discovery stemmed from the persistence of another of the three researchers. pathologist George Williams, who performed the original examination\nof the sailor's body.\nIn a report in the Lancet in the 1960s, Mr Williams described it as a unique case of pneumonia \naccompanied by overwhelming complications and secondary infections.\nWhen Aids became officially recognised in the .1980s, Mr Williams reminded his colleagues of\nthe similarity and asked If they could, reopen the sailor's case. By then, the sailor's only physical remains were samples of tissue\nstored in paraffin blocks. (AP)"}
