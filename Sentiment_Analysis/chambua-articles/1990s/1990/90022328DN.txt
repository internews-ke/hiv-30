{"text": "FEBRUARY 23, 1990\nPopulation, debt:\nThe trouble spots\nFrom PAUL REDFERN\u2028\nNATION Staff Correspondent,\u2028\nLONDON\u2028\nKenya is one of the few countries\u2028\nto emerge with any credit from\u2028\nthe World Bank\u2019s report of the\u2028\nsub- Saharan African economies,\u2028\nbut the warning signs are there\u2028\nfor the future.\u2028\nThere are only nine countries\u2028\nin sub-Saharan Africa which\u2028\nhave shown a percentage growth\u2028\nin GNP of two per cent or more\u2028\nsince 1965. They include Kenya.\u2028\nBut during the 1980-87 period,\u2028\nthe Kenyan economy had a negative growth of 0.9 per cent.\u2028\nThe decrease in growth was\u2028\nnot unique to Kenya, with 21\u2028\nother African countries showing\u2028\na negative growth rate greater\u2028\nthan one percent, but it was a bad\u2028\nshock to a country that had experienced considerable growth\u2028\nbefore.\u2028\nFor Kenya, the most worrying\u2028\nareas are the continued population expansion and the increasing\u2028\ndebt. The country now has the\u2028\nhighest percentage of children\u2028\nunder five in sub-Saharan Africa.\u2028\nAlthough the population increase is now starting to decline,\u2028\nthe country\u2019s population is predicted to rise to 37 million by the\u2028\nend of the decade, 15 million\u2028\nmore than at present.\u2028\nIn 1987, Kenya\u2019s debt or US $4.978 billion represented 64 per cent of the country\u2019s GNP, an\u2028\nincrease of 25 per cent on 1980.\u2028\nWhile this was less than that of\u2028\n22 other sub-Saharan African\u2028\ncountries, it was a high burden\u2028\nfor any country to bear.\u2028\nKenya stands up well in the\u2028\nfield of education and health care\u2028\ncompared with other African\u2028\ncountries and has one of the best\u2028\nstatistics of nurses per population, but there is still only one\u2028\ndoctor per 10,100 people.\u2028\nIn 1987, the Kenyan Government spent 23.1 per cent of its\u2028\nexpenditure on education, 6.6 per\u2028\ncent on health and 9.1 per cent\u2028\non the military.\u2028\nOne of the country\u2019s biggest\u2028\n-concerns is the rapid increase in\u2028\ndeforestation, which is now the\u2028\nseventh highest in sub-Saharan\u2028\nAfrica with the loss -of 67,000\u2028\nhectares of forest a year.\u2028\nThe World Bank report praises\u2028\nKenya\u2019s attempt to diversify its\u2028\nproduction away from primary\u2028\nproducts, such as coffee and tea,\u2028\nand in particular into\u2028\nhorticulture.\u2028\n\u201cProductive land In Kenya has\u2028\nbecome scarce relative to the\u2028\ngrowing supply of labour,\u201d the re\u2028\nport states. \u201cIn this situation,\u2028\nhorticultural cultivation, by making intensive use of both land arid\u2028\nlabour, is highly appropriate. It employs about 20 per cent of the\u2028\nlabour force (1.8 million people)\u2028\nduring the harvest season and it\u2028\nprovides small scale landholders\u2028\nwith an additional source of in.\u2028\ncome and improved food security.\u2028\n\u201cKenya, which had almost no\u2028\nflower exports. 15 years ago, is\u2028\nnow the world\u2019s fourth largest ex\u2028\nporter of flowers. Roses; orchids\u2028\nand carnations are the most\u2028\npopular.\u201d\u2028\nKenya\u2019s breweries also receive\u2028\npraise for their efforts to move\u2028\nfrom exports to neighbouring\u2028\ncountries to overseas markets.\u2028\nThe World Bank says that\u2028\nAfrican entrepreneurs will be able\u2028\nto increase their export markets\u2028\nthe more easily they can travel\u2028\nand transfer their foreign ex\u2028\nchange earnings, but whether this\u2028\nwill happen after 1992 and the\u2028\nSingle Market in Europe is open\u2028\nto doubt.\u2028\nOne of the country\u2019s biggest\u2028\nsuccess stones, the World Bank\u2028\nsays, is in the field of small enter\u2028\nprises. \u201cIn the past decade, employer it in Kenya\u2019s urban informal sector has been growing\u2028\nrapidly.\u2028\n\u201cThe growth of this sector has\u2028\nbeen the main factor holding\u2028\ndown increases in open urban unemployment.\u201d\u2028\nIn the 1970s, Kenya opened its\u2028\ntransport sector to competition,\u2028\nwith the result that matatus were\u2028\nrecognised and allowed to\u2028\norganise an association to represent their interests. But this was\u2028\n\u2018banned recently when matatu\u2028\ndrivers attempted to raise fares\u2028\nabove the ceilings set by the\u2028\nGovernment.\u2028\nThe Government has made\u2028\nsustained progress in encouraging small-scale manufacturing\u2028\nand the repair enterprises known\u2028\nas Jua Kali. Simple sheds\u2028\nequipped with power, water, public telephones and rest rooms\u2028\nhave been established through\u2028\nthe support of the Government,\u2028\nNGOs and local banks.\u2028\n\u201cBy providing essential infrastructure while maintaining informal linkages and proximity to\u2028\nlocal markets, the Government is\u2028\nenabling small-scale manufacture\u2028\nand repair services to organise\u2028\nproduce r or savings co-operatives\u2028\nLo improve their access to capital\u2028\nand technology,\u201d the report\u2028\nstates.\u2028\nThe ability that Kenya has to attract hundreds of thousands of\u2028\nforeign tourist because of its stable political environment also receives praise, although the report\u2028\nwarns that \u201cconsiderable re\u2028\nsources should be attracted to en\u2028\nsure the protection of the\u2028\nenvironment\u201d. -\u2028\nThe World Bank Warns that\u2028\none of the biggest threats to Africa\u2019s future survival is Aids, which\u2028\ncould devastate the young educated population in sub-Saharan\u2028\nAfrica. \u2028\nThe World \u2018 Health\u2028\nOrganisation estimates that more\u2028\nthan a million people in Africa.\u2028\nare affected by the HIV virus and\u2028\nthat 30 per cent of these will\u2028\nevolve into Aids cases in a few\u2028\nyears.\u2028\n\u2018 The countries most affected\u2028\nare Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda,\u2028\nTanzania, Uganda and Zaire.\u2028\n\u201cThe treatment of Aids patients\u2028\nwill increase demand on weak\u2028\nhealth-care systems in the countries to which it spreads,\u201d the re\u2028\nport warns.\u2028\n\u201cTo combat Aids, resources likely to be diverted from e\u2028\ntreatment and control of other\u2028\nimportant diseases. Different\u2028\nmodels show the death rate rising\u2028\nfrom 20 to 100 per cent in be\u2028\ntween two and three decades.\u201d\u2028\nThe World Bank says that\u2028\napart from increased pan-African\u2028\nand regional trade co-operation,\u2028\nAfrican countries should do far\u2028\nmore to investigate mineral ex\u2028\ntraction. \u201cAfrica is well endowed\u2028\nwith minerals and so far only a\u2028\nfraction of this wealth has been\u2028\nextracted,\u201d the report states.\u2028\nBut above all, the World Bank\u2028\nstates that the 4-5 per cent\u2028\ngrowth rate that African countries need to develop must be sustainable and equitable.\u2028\n\u201cTo ensure Africa\u2019s future welfare, the next generation must\u2028\nfirst build solid foundations for\u2028\nsustainable and equitable growth:\u2028\nSustainable because care must be\u2028\ntaken to protect the productive\u2028\ncapacity of the environment and\u2028\nequitable because this is\u2028\ncondition both for political ability and ultimately for sustained growth.\u201d\u2028"}
