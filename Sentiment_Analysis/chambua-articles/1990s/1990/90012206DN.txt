{"text": "An unnecessary Aids-cure row \nIs this hooha between Kenya's herbalists on the one hand,\nand the Kenya Medical Research Institute (Kemri) and the\nDirector of Medical Services, Prof Joseph Oliech, on the\nother, really necessary?\nThe answer to this question is simply that this brouhaha\nis absolutely unnecessary and increasingly unfortunate.\nHowever, if the truth be said, there is a lot at stake both in\nterms of prestige and, most important, money in the issue\nwhich has given rise to this sizzling controversy.\nTo understand why the men whose tools of trade include\nherbs, roots, ash and other paraphernalia and their\ncounterparts who deal with stethoscopes, microscopes,\nsyringes, blood samples, laboratory-manufactured drugs\nand scalpels are engaged in this hoopla, it is imperative to\ngo back to last December 6.\nOn that day, the soft-spoken Director of Kemri, Dr Davy\nKoech, made a most remarkable and breathtaking\nannouncement. Kemri, Dr Koech declared, had developed a\npromising drug in humankind's struggle against the dreaded\nand fatal Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (Aids).\nThis drug, he said, reverses Aids symptoms and gives Aids\nsufferers the best chance of leading a normal life.\nWhat does this kind of revelation portend? Instant fame\nfor Kemri in particular and Kenya in general and, of course,\nj he money that is guaranteed to flow in if eventually the\npromising drug is developed into a cure. Indeed, even before\nthe drug is developed into a cure it still is a money-spinner\ngiven the fact that it does, in fact, reverse the opportunistic\ndiseases that kill HIV carriers ..\nWhile Kenyans were still trying to digest the news from\nKemri, the country's herbalists were up in arms, accusing\nthe institute of stealing the KE089, the code name of the\ndrug, from one of their number and arrogating to itself the\nhonour of its discovery. Now, the herbalists, still adamant\nthat they have a cure (or Aids, are saying that they will\nnever ever\u00b7 collaborate with Kemri again.\nAbout a fortnight ago, a new angle was introduced to the\nscenario when a herbalist in Kakamega District .was\nreported to have treated and cured an Aids patient at an\nhospital in the sugarcane and historical town of Mumias.\nFoul Play! screamed Prof Oliech, who, in fact, threatened to\nhave the herbalist deported because he is not a Kenyan.\nThe DMS said that the man the Kakamega herbalist\ntreated was not suffering from Aids but tuberclosis. The\nman is adamant he is Kenyan, insists he has an Aids cure\nand is challenging the DMS and the Minister for Health,\nMr Mwai Kibaki, to allow him to treat Aids patients in\nGovernment hospitals free of charge.\nWe doubt that he will be allowed into those institutions\n.the veracity or otherwise of his claims notwithstanding. But\nthe current runs deeper than that. Should the herbalists\nand medical doctors not collaborate in the search for a cure\nfor this scourge? We say they absolutely must.\nShould all herbalists be allowed to go public with\nannouncements about their supposed cures for Ukimwi?\nOur answer here is an emphatic no. There has to be a way\nof having the herbalists liaise with Kemri for their drugs to\nbe tested before they go to rooftops to broadcast their cures.\nWe know of myriads of cases where self-styled herbalists\nhave conned Kenyans out of their cattle, sheep, goats, land\nand money. But, is Kemri conning the country's genuine\nherbalists out of KE089? That is for Dr Koech and his men\nto tell the world and we 'Would like to believe that they are\nset to do precisely that when they divulge more information\nabout KE089.\nIn the meantime, we would urge that herbalists and\nKemri work together, for theirs is not a service to Kenya's\nscientists and herbalists alone, but a service to humankind\nthreatened with decimation by Aids."}
