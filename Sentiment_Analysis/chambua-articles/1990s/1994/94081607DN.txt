{"text": "There is nothing like 'safe sex'\nThis letter is written in response\nto one by a Mr Omondi titled\n\"Show the film on Aids free of\ncharge,\" which' appeared in the\nNation, August 4.\nI am a young man and I am\ntotally against Omondi's proposal\nthat the film, More Time, should\nbe shown to the youth because I\nbelieve it is not sincere.\nYes, the film propagates the\nnecessity of checking the spread\nof Aids which is a good thing.\nHowever, the method advocated,\nsafe sex, is what I am against.\nFirst and foremost, what is safe\nsex? Is it possible to have safe sex\noutside a monogamous marriage?\nMy dear Mr Omondi, even the\norganisations you mentioned like\nKnow Aids Society, WHO, Unicef\nand, let me add, IPPF, know that\nit is not. They would even tell you\n(if they were sincere), that \"safe\nsex\" is a myth.\nYou might then ask, why don't\nthey? Let me tell you why they\ndon't. Safe sex and all that goes\nwith it is a lucrative business and\nthey are the beneficiaries.\n, When one, talks of safe sex,\nwhat comes immediately to mind\nis the condom, variously known\nas \"rubber\" or \"jacket\". '\nThe condom, as a matter of fact, has a 30per cent failure rate\nagainst Aids. We are not told this\nin More Time.\nOut of every three users of a\ncondom one will definitely be an\nHIV carrier. Who knows, you or I\ncould be that unfortunate person.\nEver heard of Human Papilloma\nVirus (HPV)?\nThis is an incurable STD that\ncannot be prevented by wearing a\ncondom, unless you were to wear\nboxer short type.\nHPV culminates in cancer of\nthe genitals and death is\ninevitable.\nThe movie does not warn\nyouth about the disease. And\nwhat about cancer of the cervix?\nThe movie does not tell us that\ncondoms do not prevent teenage\ngirls getting cancer of the cervix.\nSo then, is safe sex really safe?\nYes, sex is safe when it is saved\n- for a monogamous marriage.\nNo worries, no sweat.\nNow, why doesn't More Time\ntell us about saved sex -which in\nactual fact is the safest sex?\nThe movie, More Time, is a\nsad disgrace and will only mislead\nand destroy the lives of otherwise\ninnocent youth.\nDavid F.
