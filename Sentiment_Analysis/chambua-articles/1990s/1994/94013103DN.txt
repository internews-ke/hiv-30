{"text": "THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 30, 1995\n\nLegal aspects of Aids \u2018vital\u2019\n\n\nBy KIPIKOECH TANUI\u2028\nAttorney-General Amos Wako yesterday\u2028\nwarned that Aids prevention efforts will be\u2028\nfutile if legal and ethical issues are not\u2028\naddressed.\u2028\nHe urged a balance between the rights of\u2028\nthe individual and those of the public.\u2028\nThe AG also questioned the legality of\u2028\nsuggestions by some clergymen, politicians\u2028\nand the public on mandatory testing for HIV.\u2028\nUnlike some countries, he said, Kenya did not\u2028\nhave any legislation that provided for mandatory testing for H IV.\u2028\nMr Wako said the protection of the human\u2028\nrights and dignity of HIV-Aids infected\u2028\npeople was an effective means through which\u2028\nthe war against the spread of the scourge\u2028\ncould be fought.\u2028\nStatistics showed that the rate of HIV infection in Kenya could rise from the current\u2028\n1.3 million to nearly 2 million by the year\u2028\n2005.\u2028\nHe warned that discrimination through denial of employment and the isolation from the community of those infected with Aids, could\u2028\ndrive them underground \u201cwhere they will operate freely in spreading the disease\u201d\u2028\nMr Wako was speaking during the opening\u2028\nof a one-day workshop on Aids at Kenyatta\u2028\nInternational Conference Centre, Nairobi.\u2028\nThe workshop was organized by the United\u2028\nNation\u2019s Development Programmed and the\u2028\nKenya Legal and Ethical Issues Network.\u2028\nHe urged the participants to explore whether\n\nThe penalties in the country\u2019s legislation needed strengthening, and if offences such as rape in the era of Aids epidemic required review.\u2028\n\u201cA wilful act, whatever form it takes, where it results in injury to someone, and in the case of Aids, to fatal injury, is indefensible in any society and the punishment should\u2028be commensurate with the gravity of the offence.\u201d\u2028\nThe AG also said the stigmatisation of the\u2028\ndisease and discrimination of the infected\u2028\nwould seriously exacerbate the difficulty of\u2028\npreventing innocent people from HIV infection.\u2028\n\u201cThe stemming of the spread of HIV depends 0n the winning of the con1idente and prevention infected persons in order to provide them with information, education and\u2028\nsupport, and to promote positive change of in behaviour. \u201cKenya had no legislation dealing with\u2028\nAids. The spread of the disease, he said, had brought about fear of people treading on the legal rights of the victims.\u2028\nMr Wako said Aids threatened to upset\u2028\nmedical ethics and questioned whether it was necessary for a doctor to maintain confidentiality of a patient\u2019s condition to the spouse,\u2028\nwhich result in infection of the other party.\u2028\nThere was need for research aimed at a\u2028\ncure for Aids. However, he warned that the\u2028\npublic must be protected from \u201cquacks selling snake oil as cures\u201d."}
