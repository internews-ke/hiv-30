{"text": "Kenya ranks fourth in Aids - UN official\nBy GEORGE OWUOR\nKenya is among the top five countries in Africa with the highest incidence of Aids; a Unicef official said yesterday.\nMs Caroline Blair, a United Nations Children's Fund officer in charge of Aids prevention, said Kenya was fourth after Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe in that order in Aids cases.\nThe main reason for this, she said, was mobility in workforce.\nShe said half the country's hospital beds would be occupied by Aids patients by the year 2,000 and higher child mortality was expected in the future because of the high rate of female infection.\nMs Blair called for more access to condoms to help curb the spread of the HIV virus. \"The current infection figure is estimated at 728,000.\"\nShe was presenting a paper during a seminar for Unicef workers at a Naivasha hotel.\nIt was chaired by the country representative, Mr Vincent O'Reilly. '\nThe seminar, which ended yesterday, reviewed the\norganisation's activities in the country in the past one year."}
