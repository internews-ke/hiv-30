{"text": "Advertisers should give all facts\nThe article entitled \u201cAdverts not\ntruthful\" by Cyprian Nkondi\n(Daily Nation, July 19) on the\nvalue of condoms and the need to\nwarn users of the risks involved\ncannot go unsupported.\nThe failure of condoms and\nother birth control methods is\ndue to their damage through slipshod\nand negligent shipping and\nwarehousing for long periods. These materials are stored in\nhot warehouses for long periods\nand stored unsuitably in trucks,\nand containers.\nThe condoms are manufactured\nin Western countries like\nAmerica. where temperatures\ndrop to freezing point, then are\nunloaded at Mombasa which\nrecords high temperatures. Remember that resistance\ntests are carried out by the manufacturer\nand that by the time\nthey arrive in the country, they\nare at the \"point of purchase\".\nCondoms and laboratory gloves\nare made of latex, the milky sap\nof a rubber tree and a combination\nof several chemicals. When\nthese chemicals are exposed to\ntemperatures below room temperature,\nthe chemicals\ncrystallise and when exposed to\ntemperatures above room temperature,\noxidation takes place.\nThese extreme temperatures\ncause latex condoms to crack and\ndry out and lose tension.\nThe question is: Suppose\ncondoms were of good shape would they be \"safe\" in the Aids\ncontext?\nThe HIV virus is three times\nsmaller' than herpes, 60 times\nsmaller than the spirochete, that\ncauses syphillis, and 450 times\nsmaller than a single sperm.\nSmall particles such as the\nHIV virus can pass through the\n\"pores\" of a good condom as well\nas a \"cracked and dried out\" one.\nWhy then are teenagers and\nadults urged through the mass\nmedia to use condoms as a \"safe\nsex warranty\", and not made\naware of the size of the HIV\nvirus? Why are we not told of the 10-\n20 per cent failure bracket?\nIf condoms have failed thus,\nand in fact have failed in preventing\npregnancy, how far will the\nHIV virus be prevented from\ntransmission by the same?\nSurgeons can prove me wrong\nwhen I say that defective surgical\nand examination latex gloves allow\nblood to pass through due to\nthe above mentioned causes.\nHence condoms are no exception. Therefore safe sex will only be\nguaranteed by a change of morals,\na change that will come from\nwithin individuals, not from\nwithout; abstinence and upholding\nmoral teaching which the society\nhas always advocated,\ncrowned by the teaching of\nChrist.\nGeorge S.
