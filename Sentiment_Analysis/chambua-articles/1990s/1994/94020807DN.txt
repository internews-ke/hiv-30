{"text": "The horrifying statistics of Aids\nOne in every 18 adults in Kenya is infected\nwith the HIV virus that causes Aids. In the\nurban areas, the rate stands at one in nine\nadults, or 11 per cent.\nThese gruesome figures were given in a lecture\ndelivered at the Kenya Institute of Education\n(KIE) by Prof Edward Mburugu of the\nDepartment of Sociology at the University of\nNairobi.\nThe professor was using 1993 figures released\nby the National Council for Population\nand Development.\nSince 1983 when the first HIV cases were\nreported, 130,000 recorded people have died\nof Aids in Kenya. Many other deaths from the\nvirus may have gone unreported, especially\ndue to the social stigma associated with Aids.\nEarly in 1993, it was estimated that 728,000\ncases of HIV positive persons existed. These\nare people who are carriers of the deadly virus\nthough possibly not aware of it.\nAccording to the figures obtained from Sentinel\nSurveillance Sites established in various\nparts of the country, the HIV positive prevalence\nis 20 to 30 per cent in Kisumu, Busia\nand Kitale, 10 to 20 per cent in Mombasa,\nNairobi, Nakuru and Kakamega and 2 to 10\nper cent in Kisii, Nyeri, Kitui and Garissa.\n. No clear explanation can be found to fit the\nlow rates reported in some of the areas.\nIn delivering his lecture at the KIE to members\nof a UNICEF -funded Aids Awareness\nProject, Prof Mburugu said the commonest\nHIV strain in eastern and southern Africa\nwas HIV-1 which, he said, was more deadly\nthan HIV-2.\nIn Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Zambia, Malawi,\nZimbabwe and Botswana, more than 10\nper cent of all adult urban populations are infected with the virus.\nCommenting on the methods of transmission,\nProf Mburugu said sexual contact accounted\nfor 75 per cent of all cases while perinatal\n(baby infected by mother) accounted for\n20 per cent. Blood transfusion took 5 per cent.\nSo far, it has been found that 30 - 40per cent\nof all babies born of infected mothers have\ntested HIV positive.\nThis proportion accounts for about 30,000\ninfants up to the age of five years who are\ninfected with the HIV in Kenya today.\nIt has been shown that 50 per cent of all\nthose infected with the HI\" develop full blown\nAids within eight years and 95 per cent\nwithin 15 years.\nCases of full-blown Aids developing in the\nfirst five years account for 80 per cent of\nthose who have tested HIV positive.\nAmong infants, more than 95 per cent of\ninfected cases develop Aids within four years.\nMost Aids sufferers die within one year.\nProjections to the year 2005 reveal that 9.1\nper cent of the total population will be HIV\npositive. This proportion would mean about 2\nmillion persons in Kenya.\nAt the same time, there will be one million\nAids orphans. Instead of a projected population\nof 36 million people, Kenya will have\nonly 34 million persons by the year 2005.\nIn 1992, Aids cases occupied 15 per cent of\nall hospital beds in the country and this will\nincrease to 50 per cent by the year 2000 which\nis only six years away.\nThis, coupled with the fact that of all the\nAids cases 75 per cent are to be, found in the\n20-45 year age group, is likely, to result in\nheavy economic losses to the country.\nThere have been no reported cases in age groups between 6 and 14 years. The KIE/UNICEF project is targeted at educating this age group (6-14 years) in ways of avoiding\nHIV infection.\nThe professor listed various interventions\nin the fight against AIDs.\nTo avoid transfusions of contaminated\nblood, the donor should be screened and his/\nher blood tested.\nFamily planning and counselling for infected\npersons should be encouraged and people\nshould avoid multiple sex partners:\nDelaying the onset of sexual activity among\nyouth, use of condoms and control of Sexually\nTransmitted Diseases (STDs) will also reduce\nthe rate of HIV infection.\nIt is estimated that if all these interventions\nare used widely, only 6.6 per cent of the .\npopulation will be infected by the year 2005.\nIf condoms are not used, the rate of-infection\nmay rise to 13 per cent of the total Kenyan\npopulation. Should all the methods be\nignored, there will be about 15 persons with\nHIV out of every 100 by the year 2005.\nAsked why the rate of infection was higher\nin urban than in rural areas, the professor\nattributed this to the sex ratio in urban areas\n'where more men are likely to be 'living with:\nout their spouses, thus predisposing them to\ncasual sex.\nUrban women tend to have multiple sexual\npartners as a result of this sex ratio. Unlike\nother African countries, Kenya has more infected\nwomen than men..\nS. Mutea Irea,\nNairobi."}
