{"text": "June 1, 94\n\nRole of nutrition in the control of Aids\nBy SHAMS POONAWALA-DHARAMSHI\nAcquired immuno deficiency syndrome\n(AIDS) is a disease that\naffects the immune system\nwhich is caused by the human\nimmune deficiency virus (HIV).\nSince it is a progressive disease,\nit is important to take good care\nof one's self from the earliest diagnosis\nof HIV. HIV alters the\nimmune system, hence, nutrition\nplays a crucial part in the long\nterm care of a patient with HIV/\nAIDS.\nKenyan statistics indicate that\nHIV cases are on an increase. The\ncurrent number of those infected\nwith HIV is approximated to be\nin the 720,000s,as there are still a\nlot of unreported cases. As these,\nnumbers continue to rise, and the\nincreasing problem of availability\nof hospital beds for Aids patients\ncontinues, home-based care will\nbecome more important and families\nand health workers will have\nto maximise from what is available\nfor patient.\nWeight-loss, diarrhoea, malnutrition,\nother forms of infection,\ne.g. tuberculosis, pneumonia, are\nconsequences of Aids. Hence,\nthere are increased nutrient\nneeds as the normal intake is decreased,\ndigestion and absorption\nof nutrients are altered and nutritional\ndeficiencies occur.\nThe nutritional state of an individual\ncan and may affect the\nrate of progress of the' disease\nand impacting the number of infections\ncontracted.\nThe disease will continue to\nprogress even with the best nutritional\ncare, but it can make individuals\nfeel better, and the nutrition\nbalance can limit, hospital\ndays by decreasing the susceptibility\nfor infections.\nNutrients that are associated\nwith the immune function are: vitamins,\nA, C, E, B6, folic acid,\nB12, zinc, iron, copper and selenium. \nMost of these foods are\nfound by eating a wide variety of\nfresh fruits, vegetables, whole\ngrains and cereals. '\nVitamin A: is present in all fruits\nand vegetables with a red-orange\ncolour e.g. paw paw, mango,\ncarrots.\nVitamin C: all citrus fruits, oranges,\ntangerines, tomatoes.\nVitamin E: eggs, yolk, milk fat,\nbutter, meat (especially liver),\nmaize, soybean.\nVitamin B6: pork, glandular meat\n(especially, liver), legumes/l .\npotatoes, bananas, porridge.' ,\nFolic acid: All dark green leafy\nvegetables, cabbage, spinach,\nkale, broccoli.\nVitamin B12: found in animal\nprotein, liver, kidney, milk, eggs,\nfish, cheese.\nZinc: milk, liver, shellfish, wheat\nbran.\nIron: liver, meat, egg york, legumes/\nlentils.\nCopper: liver, shellfish, whole\ngram, kidney, chicken, nuts,\nSelenium: grains, onions, meat,\nmilk\nA multi vitamin supplementation\ncan be started early in the\ndisease state, to maximise the nutrient\nstores and levels present in\nthe body for as long as possible.\nDuring confinement days: frequent small meals are advised\nwhen nausea and vomiting\npresent, the patient is the best\njudge of what is palatable and accommodate\nhis/her needs, at the\nsame time ensuring that his/her\nintake is balanced throughout the\nday.\nBy keeping a watchful eye on\none's nutritional state during early\ndiagnosis of HIV, can help provide\na better quality of life for\nany individual.\nIt will also help prevent the onset\nof infections during the first\nstages.\nLots of fresh juices are also advisable\nto obtain concentrated\nquantities of nutrients."}
