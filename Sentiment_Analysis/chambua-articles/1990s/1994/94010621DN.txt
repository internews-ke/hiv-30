{"text": "Date: DAILY NATION, TUESDAY, JANUARY 6, 1994\n\nHIV viruses classified\nA virologist, Gerald Myers, the\ndirector of HIV Sequencing Project at Los Alamos National\nLaboratory in USA, has found\nthat strains of HIV seem to cluster in at least five - and possibly\nmore - distinct families and not\njust the broad western and African\ngroupings that researchers\nhave accepted for nearly a\ndecade.\nMyers and his team of Los\nAlamos researchers began collecting\nsequences of HIV genes in\ngenebank computers in the mid 1980s when the sequences first\nbecame available and they\nworked out a genetic family tree\nwith multiple branches of the\npredominant form of the AIDS\nvirus, HIV.\nThe computer analysis traces\ngenetic changes showing which of\nthe strains are most closely related\nand likely to have emerged\nfrom common ancestors.\nThe AIDS virus mutates very rapidly and that has made most\nresearchers to abandon the hope\nof developing a single vaccine\nwhich is effective against all the\nresultant strains.\nMyers project is aimed at determining whether\nit is possible\nto concoct multiple - strain cocktail\nvaccines like those used in\nFlu. Flu comes in three major\nfamilies and Myers took a cue\nfrom Flu vaccine'research, and he\nhas now spent years cataloguing\nknown strains of HIV.\nLast year , his research team\nrealised'that HIV viruses cluster\ninto recognisable \"Families\".\nStrains from the United States\nand Europe fall into the first\ngroup; Brazilian and Zairean\nstrains in the second; Zambia and\nSomaIia strains in the third; Taiwanese\nstrains in the fourth; and\nstrains from Uganda, the Ivory\nCoast and Kenya fall in the fifth.\nThese findings should be important\ncontribution to vaccine\nresearch, say many virologists."}
