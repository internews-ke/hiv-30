{"text": "Kisumu's artistic fires are all\nkindled, thanks to Chamberlain\nBy OKUMBA MIRUKA\nSince Roger Chamberlain went to Kisumu about\na month ago, he has been groping in the dark\nlooking for the flicker that would kindle the fire.\nAt times it has appeared like the kindle had\ncome and he has been wondering: Should I work\nwith established artists or upstarts? Should the\ngroup develop an original script or go for one of\nthe favourite oldies?\nWith time keeping its race against him, he has\nbeen doing rounds visiting existing groups and\nestablishing rapport with as many artists as possible.\nIf he were in politics, someone would call\nhim a door to door campaigner. And just now\nthe results are beginning to show. Thirty five\nartists calling themselves the Umbrella Group\nhave enlisted and sunk their teeth into the theatrical\npie early this week when they did human\nsculptures of the Kenyan past ..\nNeither the group nor Roger have abdicated\nfrom theatre and gone for fine art as the idea of\nsculptures might imply. It is only that the kindle\nhe was waiting for came through fine art:, in fact\nthrough the cinema. As he was watching this\nvideo of Zimbabwean Shona sculptures, he got\nthe inspiration he needed to get going. With\nJohn Obaso Diang'a, a sculptor, giving him company and sharing not only theoretical but practical\nideas as well, this just had to be it: Exploring\nthe talent available in the group by sculpturing\nthe Kenyan past dramatically. The future then\nwill take care of itself.\nNot quite. The group will take care of the\nfuture. Yes, Care International in Kenya, the\nKisumu office, is already taking care by entering\ninto a co-operation with the British Council so that Roger can direct the group Kamikaze in\nCare's HIV/Aids community-oriented theatre\nproject.\nLike Roger was doing immediately .on teaching\nKisumu, Care has also been groping m the\ndark with its drama activities looking for someone\nto give professional direction to the group\nand hopefully impart sustainable skills to the\nartists. The groping looks like it is doing the last\nlap. ' ..\nAs it were, Roger went down to Kisumu with\nthe prime aim of working in the formal education\nsector and undertaking theatre in education\ntasks. So far, he has contacted three reliable\nteachers who will form the core of a group of six\nwith whom he hopes to start working next\nmonth to develop pieces for a tour.\nIn his own words, the product is meant to be\n\"with for and by the teachers\" to address educational'\nagenda. In the wings are possibilities of\nworking with the staff and students of Maseno\nUniversity College and the possibility, now looking\nquite real, of video taping the processes he\nand the groups he works With go through to\ncapture the ephemeral highlights that would not\nbe replicable without that kind of aid.\nA festival in November is still in Roger's\nmind. Right now, the idea is concretising around\nmaking it a collage of a festival including theatre\npieces and rap music from the Cookie Crew, an\nensemble of British Carribbeans who will be\ntouring Uganda and whom the British Council is\nintending to invite for a concert towards the end\nof the year ..\nRoger is still hoping that some more artists\ncan link up with him through the British Council\noffices in Kisumu."}
