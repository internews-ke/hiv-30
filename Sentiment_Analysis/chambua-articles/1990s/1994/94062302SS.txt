{"text": "THURSDAY, JULY 21, 1994\n\nBook on Aids\" courses produced\n\nBy DAVID ADUDA\u2028\nDissemination of information on\u2028\nAids should start in school and\u2028\nfrom there spread to all sections\u2028\nof the society. This view 18 advocated by authorities in Zimbabwe\u2028\nwhere the school curriculum pro\u2028\nvides for courses on Aids.\u2028\nThe Ministry of Education and\u2028\nCulture in that country has published the book, Let\u2019s Talk; an\u2028\nAids Action Programme for Schools.\u2028\nThe publication is meant to facilitate the teaching of this subject in schools.\u2028\nIt is intended to develop\u2028\nknowledge, attitudes and to\u2028\nmaximise individual\u2019s and community\u2019s commitment to the safest and protective behaviourpossible.\u2028\nThe programme aims at helping pupils to, develop acceptable\u2028\nmodes of behaviour which would\u2028\nalso end up benefiting their families, villages and whole\u2028\ncommunities.\u2028\nEqually, the programme would\u2028\ninculcate in pupils values and life\u2028\nskills, \u2014 problem solving, analysis, evaluation and prediction \u2014\u2028\nthat are conducive to positive, responsible and healthy lifestyles.\u2028\nFurther, the programme would help pupils to understand and\u2028\ndeal with their own health problems, fears, puberty, sexuality\u2028\nand relationships.\u2028\nThe various relationships dis\u2028\ncussed include peer groups, gen-\u2028\neral friends,family members and\u2028\nmembers of the wider society.\u2028\nThe textbook also talks about\u2028\nhuman growth and development\u2028\nwith the aim of making the pupils\u2028\nunderstand physical changes at\u2028\npuberty and concomitant psycho\u2028\nlogical and emotional development, and the challenges that\u2028\nthese present to the adolescent8\u2028\nwho must adopt responsible and\u2028\nhealthy lifestyles.\u2028\nHealthy lifestyles, the text\u2028\nsays, promote the development of\u2028\na positive self-image and avoidance of diseases, especially HIV\u2028\nand Aids infection.\u2028\nFor the success of the programme, the texts say, teachers must be equipped with the essential knowledge, skills and attitudes about Aids.\n\nInformation\u2028\nFirstly the teacher must have\u2028\na comprehensive and accurate information on HIV and Aids if he\u2028\nis to give reliable information to\u2028\nthe pupils.\u2028\nThe teacher, adds the text,\u2028\nmust be able to confront his fears\u2028\nand feelings about HIV and Aids.\u2028\nHe must be comfortable with the\u2028\nissues raised in the course, particularly those related to human\u2028\nsexuality and sexual behaviour.\u2028\nHe should be sensitive to the\u2028\npupils\u2019 feelings about sexual affairs. It is important for the\u2028\nteacher to recognise that the pupils may bave different ideas\u2028\nabout sex and that while some\u2028\nmay have had sexual experiences,\u2028\nthere are many who know nothing about it.\u2028\nEssentially a behavioural subject, the Aids education\u2028\nprogramme must ensure Chat\u2028\nlearners actively participate in\u2028\nthe learning process. In this connection, the text says that learn-\u2028\n\u00a1ng experience should encourage\u2028\nthe pupils to evaluate their own\u2028\nand other\u2019s current patterns of\u2028\nbehaviour and to adopt and\u2028\nmaintain positive lifestyles.\u2028\nThe methodological approaches recommended include group\u2028\ndiscussions in class, role acting,\u2028\nverse recitals, songs, videos, cassette tapes, charts, photographs\u2028\nand diagrams.\u2028\nThe text says that teachers\u2028\nmust be ready to offer guidance\u2028\nand counselling to pupils and\u2028\nparents about the disease."}
