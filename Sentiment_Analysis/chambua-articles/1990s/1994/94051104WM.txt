In\u2028\n comparison, rates of HIV infer-\u2028\n lion in neighbouring Sweden\u2028\n alone are seven times higher. And\u2028\n legal cases similar to Thomas\u2019s\u2028\n are cropping ap in developing\u2028\n countries like Zimbabwe and\u2028\n Cyptus.\u2028\n The British goveenmenl recent\u2028\n ly said il is considering making it\u2028\n a criminal offence to intentionally\u2028\n infect another person with a dis\u2028\n ease such as HIV/Aidu. The an.\u2028\n noancement cane after the con\u2028\n viction of a man in Cyprus for\u2028\n intentionally infecting a British\u2028\n woman tourist with 111V.\u2028\n The move has been widely de\u2028\n noimced by Aids charity workers\u2028\n like Derek BoitaIt, Director offre\u2028\n National Aids Trust. \u201cCases will\u2028\n be difficult lo prove, the law could\u2028\n be misused for vengeance.,., and\u2028\n it may discourage peuple from\u2028\n fmding out the resulte of a 111V di\u2028\n agnosis as then they could always\u2028\n plead ignorance,\u201d he said.\u2028\n lise case in Finland has also led\u2028\n to charges of racism. Thomas is a\u2028\n black would-be musician who\u2028\n played in night dabs. Married\u2028\n with two children, his wife tested\u2028\n positive in 1993 and, shortly after,\u2028\n he did too, tu January he was re\u2028\n manded to a Helsinki prison and\u2028\n held without hail during his trial\u2028\n which ended ois July lO,\u2028\n Mutuas Fredman, u Helsinki\u2028\n lawyer who represented sis of the\u2028\n women plaintiffs, wax first altered\u2028\n by a wor.san who believed she was\u2028\n infected by Thomas, Fredman in\u2028\n formed the police and withiu\u2028\n weeks, Thomas photograph ap\u2028\n peared in the newspaper.\u2028\n Amo Arvela, Thomas\u2019s lawyer\u2028\n believes that the picture would\u2028\n never have bees published if\u2028\n Thonias were white. The storm of\u2028\n publicity, in a coanny where\u2028\n blacks accounl fee only one it. a\u2028\n thousand residents, most of them\u2028\n African refugees, Itas not helped\u2028\n Thomas\u2019s case.\u2028\n \u201cThere was a lot of publicity\u2028\n about the case because he was\u2028\n black. I think the publicity inflar\u2028\n enced the judgement, I.e was real\u2028\n ly judged beforehand,\u201d says\u2028\n Bengl Lendblom of the Helsinki\u2028\n Aids Council.\u2028\n Thomas sow intends to appeal.\u2028\n Unusually foe a prosecution law\u2028\n yer, even Fredman thinks that\u2028\n Thomas\u2019s sentence was too Isaiah\u2028\n by Finnish standards. \u201cI think the\u2028\n court may have mode a mistake,\u201d\u2028\n says Fresiman. \u201cThe appeals court\u2028\n will probably take around three\u2028\n years away.\u201d\u2028\n Because this is his firsl offence,\u2028\n Thomas will serve only half his\u2028\n sentence in jail, he cati expect to\u2028\n be paroled in 2004.\u2028\n Thomas\u2019s lawyer Ararla ad\u2028\n mite that his client is guilty, bat\u2028\n not of attempted manslaughter, an\u2028\n act which necessarily implies in\u2028\n tention to kill. Arvela says people\u2028\n with 111V very rarely intend to\u2028\n harm others.\u2028\n \u201cIn many situations 111V posi\u2028\n live people try togo on living as\u2028\n they were before, nod it is very\u2028\n human lo just keep il out of your\u2028\n mrcordingto Arveln, there\u2028\n few resources for HIV\u2019posilive\u2028\n people in Finland.\u2028\n \u2018The health care system mast\u2028\n take butler care of these people\u2028\n than it does today, not jaat people\u2028\n and send them away. They need\u2028\n support and counselling. That\u2019s\u2028\n the only way we can hurdle this\u2028\n disease.\u201d\u2028\n Worldwide, u small number of\u2028\n court cases have involved deliber.\u2028\n ate HIV transmission since the\u2028\n early l980s. But despite their rar\u2028\n ity, these cases received enormous\u2028\n publicity.\u2028\n Most involved some form of vi\u2019\u2028\n olence, such as tape, forced or\u2028\n threatened esposare to infected\u2028\n bodily fluids nr, in a very small\u2028\n number of cases, biting. flojsting\u2028\n laws against rape st assault have\u2028\n been considered adequate to deal\u2028\n with mont of the cases.(IFS)\u2028\n Conviction on\u2028\n Aids infection\u2028\n stirs fears of\u2028\n stigmatisation"}
