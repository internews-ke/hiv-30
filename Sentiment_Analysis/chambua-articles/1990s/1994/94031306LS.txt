{"text": "Drug that might lock HIV out of the womb \nJust a year ago, AZT seemed to\nbetray its promise as an Aids\nwonder drug, when European\nresearchers showed that infected\npeople gain little by taking it\nwhen they are still healthy.\nThat's still true, but research\nunveiled by US health officials\nrecently suggests that HIV\npositive women who take the\ndrug during pregnancy can\nreduce - by two thirds - the risk\nof infecting their babies. The\ndazzling implication of the study\nis that most childhood Aids could\nbe prevented with a tool already\nin hand.\nAmerican and French\nresearchers identified 477\npregnant women who were HIV positive\nbut still healthy; half .\ntook AZT during pregnancy,\nlabour and delivery - the rest\ntook a placebo. Their newborns\nwere then given six weeks of the\ntreatment their mothers\nreceived. Preliminary results for\n364 of the babies show only 8 percent of the AZT babies .\ncontracted HIV (With mild anemia as the only apparent\nside effect) versus 25 per cent in\nthe placebo group. The\nresearchers are now offering\nAZT to those still on a placebo\nwhile alerting doctors to the\nfindings.\n\u00b7 . It would appear that\nworldwide, AZT could save\n, many of the 200,000 babies born\nwith HIV each year. However,\nit's one thing to treat patients in\n\u00b7a research lab, another to get\nAZT to all those who need it.\nSince pregnant women are not\nroutinely tested for HIV, many\nwho are infected wont be\nidentified. And at a cost of $50\n\u00b7(About Sh3,500) a week, the drug\n\u00b7is beyond the means of the\nworld's poor. So even if AZT is a\nwonder drug, it wont yield\ninstant miracles"}
