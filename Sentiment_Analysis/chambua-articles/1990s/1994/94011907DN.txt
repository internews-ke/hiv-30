{"text": "Open letter to\nmedical body\nAllow me to air my grievances, on\nbehalf of the general public, to\nthe Medical Practitioners and\nDentists Board.\nAll medical practitioners in\nKenya are aware of the existence\nof a circular issued by the board\n(MPDB No. 3/79) on the code of\nprofessional conduct and\ndiscipline.\nThe booklet outlines the legal\nprovisions and registration requirements,\ndoctors' and dentists'\nrelationships with various\ngroups of members of the public\nand the manner of conduct that\nmay raise disciplinary issues.\nAccording to the code of conduct\nthe board has a duty to protect\nthe public against, say attempts\nto profit through\nadvertising and canvassing.\nYet, every so often, in the leisure\nand entertainment pages of\none local daily, one \"professor\ndoctor\" advertises of his 30'lears'\nexperience as a doctor an purports\nto cure, among others, diseases\nsuch as asthma, rheumatism,\nAids, hypertension and\nheart disease ..\nWhereas I have not seen this\nkind of advertising from Kenyan\ndoctors, why should this foreigner\nbe allowed to deceive the sick\nfor tin6Ilcial gain when it is obvious\nhe cannot deliver all he\nclaims?\nI believe if he were in a position\nto convert a HIV positive\npatient to negative in 200 days as\nhe claims, then Kenyans would\nnot be talking of the 800,000 or so\nAids cases and the strain they\nhave ,on our health-care system!\nCanvassing, especially where a\npatient is to undergo some sort of\noperation is quite rampant. Because\nof the current financial '\nstate of public health institutions,\npatients are being\ntransferred to private clinics for\nnot just surgical operations but\nalso for medical follow-up. This\nmalignancy has penetrated into\nprivate hospitals where, if a patient\nhappens to be admitted under the hospitals' care and not under a specific doctor, he may\ndie out of sheer neglect \u2022.\n, \"Medical Officer \nNairobi"}
