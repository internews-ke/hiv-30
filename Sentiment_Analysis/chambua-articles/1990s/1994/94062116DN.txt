{"text": "Bank set to finance Aids project\nBy PAUL REDFERN,\nNATION Correspondent, London\nThe World Bank is set to finance a major HIV/Aids credit for Kenya according to the latest issue of Aids Analysis, a London based newsletter from the same\npublishers as Africa Analysis.\nFollowing the recent $73.5 million project in Uganda ($50 million from the World Bank and another $23.5 million from Germany, Sweden and the UK as well as the Ugandan Government), another major credit is said to be in the pipeline for Kenya \"soon,\" although no figures are given.\nThe World Bank says it is now taking Aids-related work in Africa \"very seriously\" and the report in Aids Analysis says the new Ugandan credit (which ill on a no-interest basis) represents \"a quantum leap\" in the financing of HIV IAids-related activities in Africa. The report says there are now more than 130,000 Kenyans with full-blown Aids and around\n730,000 infected with the HIV virus, including 30,000 children. It quotes the National Aids Control Programme of Kenya as saying that by the year 2005, there could be as many as 1.9 million Kenyans who are HIV positive and almost one million orphans.\nIn Uganda, where there are estimated to be around 1.5 million people infected with the HIV virus, the new funds will go towards widespread activities aimed not only at trying to prevent the spread of HIV infection but also involving community participation. The project will also involve \"quantifiable goals\" on such issues as educational awareness. The Ugandan project includes the promotion of safer sexual behaviour and the provision of condoms as well as \"STD care seeking \nbehaviour\" meaning encouraging people to get treatment for sexually transmitted diseases. The money will also go towards community-based and home based health care support \u2013 and not towards the overburdened hospital sector - as well as ensuring that local clinics have the facilities to deal with STDs.\n\nMuslim faithful donate blood\nNurse Brigid Mbatha Kakenyi tends to Dr N. Moledina, the medical superintendent of Pumwani Matermty Hospital in Nairobi after he donated blood yesterday. D.r Moledina led members of the\nShia Muslim Community to donate blood in commemoration of the martyrdom of their founder,\nImam Husain, the grandson of the prophet Muhammed. More than 100 pints of blood was donated.\nHe said the donations would boost the hospital's blood bank. Dr Moledina said the shortage had been worsened by people's fear that they would contract the Aids virus through sharing of needles. He assured all the donors that the hospital staff used disposable needles which could not be recycled. (Picture by PAUL WAWERU)"}
