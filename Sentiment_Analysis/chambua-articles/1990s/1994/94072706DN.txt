{"text": "Macabre reaction we should act on\nWhat anger drives a mother to kill her four sons and then\ndrown herself in a dam? What anger drives a wife to set\nupon the husband and hack him to death? Why are fathers\nkilling their children, their wives and then turning the\nweapons of murder on themselves?\nThe fact is that these cases are on the increase and\nusually the first casualties of misunderstandings between\nparents or a depressed father or mother, are children,\ninnocent and defenceless children who, in fact, look upon\nthe parents for protection and succour.\nChildren in any country, like a previous Unicef report\nsaid, should be the first to benefit in times of plenty and the\nlast to suffer in times of adversity. But, right in the home,\nthis noble aim is being defeated because children are the\nfirst to suffer, usually caught in the crossfire between their\nparents.\nIt may be true that as our society develops so also do such\nbizarre cases crop up or increase, but is it not time Kenyans\nstopped and asked themselves what should be done to stop\nor minimise them? If this is not done, the next thing we\nknow, people will be murdering their neighbours for no\napparent reason.\nYesterday, the Molo housewife who was reported to have\nhacked her four sons to death was thought to have done so\nbecause her husband was having an extra-marital affair.\nThe husband was reported to have retorted that the affair\nwas a matter that was well known to the wife.\nThe woman's father, for his part, was reported to have\nsaid that she had complained about lack of food. Should\nthese be reasons for her to have killed the four children,\nbattered the two who survived, set fire to her cattle and\nhouse or dived in the dam? .\nThe two children who survived her morbid anger are\ntraumatised. They may live with this throughout their lives\nand the way they will react to society may have been\ndecided for 1i1em by the way their mother killed their\nbrothers and the fact that they missed death by a whisker.\nIs there something that should have been done before it\nwas too late? We think so. Unless she kept her feelings\nstrictly to herself until the very last minute, there must be\nsomebody, a neighbour perhaps or a relative who must have\nsuspected she was up to something or she needed help.\nShe actually needed help. Are there not Kenyans who she\ncould have turned to and confided in? There are social\nworkers in this country, there are counsellors and there are\npsychiatrists. They are people Kenyans should learn to turn\nto when they are beset with such problems.\nBut do Kenyans know that these people exist? Perhaps,\nthey should advertise themselves and let Kenyans know\nwho they are, what they do and how they can be reached. In fact, many Kenyans should come up with agencies which\nprovide help and advice in such matters and set up \"hot\nlines\" on which to be reached.\nSuch professional services exist, but for a fee and many\nordinary folk may not afford, but the Government then\nshould move in and think about how such people can be\nhelped at a minimal fee or free of charge. Indeed, Kenyans\nshould think more about ways and means of helping their\nbrethren who are in trouble.\nWhen the fear of Aids was spreading faster than the\ndisease itself and parents and relatives were forsaking their\nown who were infected with the Aids-causing HIV virus,\nsome quick thinking Kenyans set up bodies which have\nproved successful in helping victims cope with the disease.\nKenyans who are distressed or depressed because of\nmarital, financial problems, among others, or inability to\nfulfill one or other functions - like the victims of Aids -\nneed to be counselled and the Government, and men and\nwomen of goodwill should take up this challenge.\nThe children who survive such traumatic moments also\nneed counselling because such events can affect the way\nthey relate to society throughout their lives. They are\naffected psychologically and it is important that they are\nattended to immediately. But, it is apparent that this has\nnot been happening.\nIt is not too late, but if we wait a bit longer it will be; This\nmatter deserves the immediate attention of all Kenyans and\nthe Government not just because children are the future,\nbut also because every life is precious and everything\npossible should be done to save it.\nIncidentally, Molo happens to have been the epicentre of\nthe ethnic clashes and one would like to ask whether\nenough has been done to heal the wounds this violence\ncaused, especially to children.\nKenyans might wish to ponder this question, are we\ngrowing increasingly violent? Why are we turning more and more to violence to \"solve\" our problems? Diagnosis of the problem will lead to a solution."}
