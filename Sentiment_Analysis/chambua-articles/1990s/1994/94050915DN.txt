{"text": "Aids, immunisation\nput under spotlight\nBy LILIAN NDUTA\nToday marks the beginning\nof the annual International\nNurses' Week to commemorate\nthe birth of\nFlorence Nightgale, who\npioneered the nursing profession\nas we know it today.\nWith time, nurses have become\nan indispensable part of medical\nprofession through their invaluable\ncontributions towards the\nimprovement and delivery of\nhealth services since Florence\nNightgale, the Lady with the\nLamp, first moved into the hospital wards in the Crimea to take\ncare of war victims.\nThis year's theme Healthy\nFamilies For Healthy Nations\nwas chosen because within the\nfamily unit, the members' health\naffected the well being of the rest.\nThis year, the National Nurses\nAssociation of Kenya chose to\nplace emphasis on Aids and\nimmunisation programmes because\nthis are the two most pressing\nhealth issues facing the country\nnow.\nAids is at the moment the\ngreatest threat that has ever\nhumankind.\nAccording to the Director of\nthe World Health Global\nProgramme on Aids, Michael H.\nMerson, 2.5 million people,\nworldwide, had developed Aids by\nearly last year.\nThis figure is projected to rise\nto about 8 million in the next six\nyears.\nAt the same time, WHO\nprojects that by the year 2000,\nabout 30 to 40 million people\nwould have become HIV positive.\nThe impact of Aids on the family\nunit has been devastating.\nMrs Susan Musuva of NNAK\nsays that although Kenyans\nknow that Aids is a reality, many\nstill engaged in casual sexual\nrelations especially with the high\nrisk groups like prostitutes.\n\"Some people still act as if\nAids was not a reality. Such are\nyet to be convinced that Aids is a\nfact and not a myth,\" she says.\nShe says that nurses in Kenya\nwill carry out various tasks aimed\nraising Aids awareness so that\npeople could make a decision\na out their sexual behaviour.\n\"It is sad, she says, that people\nhave not yet learnt to treat each\nindividual as a potential suspect\nand will only use protective measures\nin casual sex relations instead\nof protecting their loved\nones..\n\"Members of our association\nwill reinforce the services given\nby different non-governmental\norganisations and the Government\non Aids,\" she said.\nThe association will also impress\non the people the need for\ncommunity participation in\ncaring for Aids victims.\nMrs Musuva says most people\nstill isolated their relatives once\nthey were infected with the virus.\nMost feared sharing things like\neating utensils or even sharing\ntheir hands as they thought that\nthey would contract the disease.\nShe says that currently, Aids is\na major economic burden all over\nthe world adding that developing\ncountries had taken the brunt of\nthe epidemic due to their fragile\neconomies.\n- .\"When an income earner becomes\nill, the entire economic\nstructure of the family is placed\nin jeopardy by the reduced income\nand costs of caring for the\npatient,\" Mrs Musuva said.\n\"The family unit is most\nthreatened by this epidemic because\none family member could\npass it on to another - husbands\nand wives expose their partners\n, to the virus: a mother may pass it\non to her child and older children\nmay then be forced to leave\nschool so that they can fulfill in\nfor their ailing parents,\" she said Aids has also led to the increased\nnumber of street children\nin Kenya. Most of these minors come\nfrom single parent families, especially\nthe women-headed households,\nwhose children take to the\nstreets to beg after the bread\nearner became bed-ridden.\nIn 1990,UNICEF said that every\nwoman dying of Aids, left an\naverage of two children.\nDuring the week, the nurses\nwill go out of their way to impress ,\nupon wananchi that Aids victims\nshould be given love.\nAccording to UNICEF, by the\nyear 2,000, nearly 10 million children\nand adolescents will have\nbeen orphaned through Aids.\nMost of these children will become\na responsibility of their\ngrandparents or relatives.\nAids has destroyed the demographic\nbalance between the\nbread-winners and their dependants\nto the extent that grandparents who expected to be cared\nfor were now assuming the responsibility of taking care of the\nminors left by their offspring.\n.Mrs Musuva says\nimmunisation is another area\nthat will be emphasised as the\ncountry continued to lose lives\nthrough preventable diseases.\nShe said that if children were\n.not given a solid base during\nchildhood, then they were likely\nto have poor health throughout\ntheir lives.\nThis, she said, would be part of\nthe nurses' contribution in child\nhealth which was one of the areas\nidentified as a priority by the International\nCouncil of Nurses.\nUNICEF estimates that about\n80 per cent of the world's children\nare immunised.\nThis is lower in some parts of\nthe developing countries as the\ntarget is 90 per cent within the\nnext six year.\nLast month, the Kenya Expanded\nProgramme on\nImmunisation services was nearly\ndisrupted by lack of vaccines\nwhich placed the lives of 1.4 million\nchildren and their mothers at\nrisk.\nThe programme needs Sh330\nmillion to keep running. Only\nSh96 million had been set aside\nfor it and all of it had been used.\nKEPI has improved the\nimmunisation coverage from 30\nper cent to 77 per cent.\nNurses have been urged to redouble\ntheir efforts to pass on\nimportant health information\nduring the immunisation campaign\nin areas like oral rehydration,\nsafe water and sanitation\nand respiratory infections.\nThe child health theme embraces\nmany aspects which include\nbreast-feeding. The council\nsays in the past, many hospitals\ndiscouraged breast-feeding and\nseparated mothers and infants\nbut this had now changed and\nbreast-feeding accepted as the\nbest source of nutrients for newborn\nbabies.\nThe council also urges nurses\nto educate women on the need to\nbreast-feed because a child who\nhad sufficient breast milk was\nless likely to suffer diseases\ncaused by insufficient micro-nutrients\nlike iron deficiency, anaemia,\ngoitre from lack of iodine\nand xerophthalmia from lack of\nVitamin A.\nThe nurses have also been\nasked to educate the public on\nthe negative effects of preferential\nfeeding habits in favour of'\nmale children.\nOther areas\" touched included\nsafe pregnancy, safe motherhood,\nadolescent health, family planning,\nelderly health, diet, stress,\nprevention of injuries and tobacco\nrelated diseases.\nThe theme also touches on\nwork practices: supporting the integrity\nof the family.\nThe nursing profession has experienced\nmany changes in keeping\nwith the technological advancement\nmade in medicine as\nwell as the doctor/patient demands\nin modem times. Currently, there are clinical\nnurse who are specialist in patient\ncare as well as teaching and\nfamily nurse practitioners who\nwork within the community.\nThe Nairobi branch of the\nnurses association will hold a\nseminar on Wednesday at the\nMasaba Hospital. This workshop\nwill discuss sexuality and it's impact\non the family and domestic\nviolence and its impact on the\nfamily. They will also hold a service\nat the Holy Family Basilica\ntoday.\nThe celebrations in Kenya will\nculminate at Njoro Health\nCentre on Thursday.\nA nurse gives a baby an immunisation jab: The campaign to cut down on preventable deaths\nthrough immunisation is being intensified throughout the country.
