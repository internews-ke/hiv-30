{"text": "Lack of essential drugs' list badly affects the poor\nMost of health woes in the developing\nworld are the result of\ntoo many projects being\nundertaken at the\nsame time, the World\nBank has said.\n\"As a result, the organisation\nhas said, nothing ever gets done\nthe way it should.\"\nHowever, the Third world is\nnot alone in this as the developed\nnations make the same mistakes.\nThe reason is not hard to fathom\nas there is a growing discrepancy\nbetween health needs and\nhealth wants.\nThe health wants of the upper\nand middle class have changed\nconsiderably and have been extended\nto what is called \"frontiers of medicine\".\nPeople have always wanted to be \"healthy\" and remain young\n\"forever\" if not immortal.\nWhat is new is that some of\nthese elusive dreams have come\ntrue and are available through\nthe inventiveness and skills of\nmedical science.\nSo, those who need kidneys,\nheart valves, artificial joints and\nlife long medication line up with\nthose who cannot get children\nwho in turn are joined by those\nwho want a straight nose and\nothers who want medical science\nto predetermine that their unborn\nchildren are of the right sex\nand that they will be brilliant at\nschool.\nAll this is called health care as\nare all the desperate measures to\nprolong the life of people who entirely depend on support systems.\nKenyan health planners have\ntried everything from upgrading\ntraditional birth attendants to\nopen heart surgery; allowing\nherbalists to advertise their trade\nto radiotherapy for incurable\ncancer; primary health care to\nthe establishment of a' sophisticated\npharmaceutical' industry;\nfree medical care to an expensive\ncommercial medical care sector.\nPlanners give the lion's share\nof the health budget to medical\nschools and teaching hospitals.\nOurs are no exception.\nLocal medical schools, just like\nthe rest of the world over,\nconcentrate on disease rather\nthan health, on treatment rather\nthan prevention, on prolonging\nlife rather than promoting health.\nThese schools lay emphasis on\nspecialists who can only deal with\na few specifics rather than personnel\nwho have a large scope.\nLocal medical schools also\nteach dependency on equipment,\nfacilities and a network of\nspecialists.\nThis has led to the assumption\nthat good medical care means\nmuch machinery.\nWhile this is certainly the case\nwith some diseases, it still holds true that the majority of diagnosis\nis made on history, confirmed\non examination. and documented\nby imaging or laboratory tests.\n. The majority of medical school\ngraduates only function in environments\nin which they are\ntrained.\nThat is why doctors in the\nThird World refuse to work in\ndistrict hospitals as they have not\nbeen trained to work in environments\nin which there are no facilities\nand in which there are no\nspecialists to give opinions,\nIn Kenya, as far as clinical\nmedicine is concerned, the majority\nof the population turns to the\ncommercial sector and missionary\ninstitutions.\nAs a result of the progressive\nfailure of Government hospitals,\nmany commercial health outlets\nhave come into existence. Some\nare good while others are a sham.\nAt the top, one finds medical\ncare as good and as sophisticated\nas anywhere in the Western\nworld.\nHowever, it is over specialised,\nhighly dependent on gadgetry\nand addicted to drugs. This makes. it expensive and\nonly available to the top income\ngroup though insurance schemes\nand fund-drives extend it to a\nlimited few in the lower income\nbracket.\nTop medical care is also expensive\nfor a number of other\nreasons.\nIn the first place, degenerative\ndiseases are incurable and represent\na life-long financial burden.\nDoctors are expensive too.\n. The training of doctors does\nnot make them cost-conscious as\nthey are taught to always give the\nmost complete and up to date\nservice,\nThe lack of a national drug policy\ndoes not improve things in\nKenya.\nThe enforcement of a comprehensive\nWorld Health Organisation's essential drug list\nis yet to be done although such a\nlist is required.\nThe irony of it all is that most\nof the drugs produced by the\npharmaceutical industry are not\nessential.\nWhat these firms do is to exploit\n.gullible people who think\nthey are unwell or actually sick.\nMost governments are not\nstrict the manufacture of unessential\ndrugs as none has proscribed\ntheir production and\ndispensing.\nUntil now, even the most thorough\nregulatory agencies have\nlimited their efforts to ensuring\nthat drugs were not harmful.\nHowever, in the United States,\nthe proof of their efficacy is now\nrequired.\nIn Kenya, the licensing procedure is not transparent as it allowed\nsome brand name drugs\nwhile it disallowed the generic\nequivalents.\nAdvertising directed at laymen\nis also allowed.\nPharmaceutical firms are also\naccused of not developing drugs\nfor tropical diseases for there is no money in such drugs market their drugs in the Third World in\na manner that would never be allowed\nin the developed world find\nsuppress information that would\nhurt the sale of their products.\nIn Kenya, the matter is complicated\nby the Government's desire \nto encourage local manufacture\nof drugs and attempts to protect\nthe industry.\nThis results in exorbitant prices and lack of essential drugs\nin the Government hospitals.\nDespite all this, health services\nin Kenya are far much better\nthan in any other country in the\nregion.\nThe scope and variety is great.\nIn Nairobi, we have a hospital\nwhere open heart surgery as well\nas kidney transplants is available.\nThere are also a good number of mission hospitals.\nNGOs also provide special clinics\nand contraceptive advise.\nAmong the herbalists and traditional\nhealers are also some dedicated\nand talented people who\nrecognise their limitations and\nrefer patients to doctors whenever\nthe need arises.\nNevertheless, too much money\nis spent on tertiary care and on\nspecialists and too little on cheap\nremedies and prevention.\nPrevention of disease depends\non health education and control\nof the environment: air, water,\nfood, housing, lifestyle etc.\nThe country has made great\nstrides in health education except \nsex education and family planning mainly due to resistance from the Church.:\nThis has made the control of \nsexually transmitted diseases -\nSTD - and HIV poor.\nThe victims of these diseases\nare mainly women who are more\nvulnerable to STD and HIV than\nmen.\nMost women who contract\nAids die in their late twenties and\nearly thirties.\nThe impact of this selective dying\ncan be noticed in some\nneighbouring countries.\nIndustrial, agricultural and domestic\npollution is rampant. The\nincreasing amount of toxic substances\nbeing released into the\nair, soil and water is enormous.\nSome of this toxic stuff end up\nin our 'food and no attempt.\nbeen made to monitor\ncontamination.\nHealth education does not pay\nmuch attention to the new diseases\nacquired through changed\nlifestyles.\nTobacco and miraa growing is\nencouraged as the Treasury gets\nmuch from this industry in taxes.\nNo attempt is also made to dissuade\npeople from taking huge\nquantities of sugar, fat and refined\nstarch and lip service is\npaid to accident prevention and\ndrunken driving.\nSociety is also increasingly becoming\nmore violent and the\npeople entrusted to maintain law\nand order are among the most\nviolent.\nThe health of the nation is on\nthe decline with the poor being\nthe most badly affected.\nThus, maternal and child mortality\nis on the increase while the\nnutritional status is deteriorating.\nThe other group of least\nhealthy Kenyans are the rich most of whom are over\nweight and suffering from all\nmanner of lifestyle ailments\ncaused by stress, little sleep, lack\nof exercise, consumption of too\nmuch meat, alcohol and a loose\nsex life.\n\nDoctors operating on a patient in one of the local hospitals: In Nairobi, we have a hospital where open heart surgery as well as kidney transplants is available, (File picture)\n\nThis is the third part of a four-part series by IMRE\nLOEFFLER focusing on health and health services in the country.
