{"text": "Allow me to congratulate the officials of the\nAids Orphan Support Organization of Kenya\n(AOSOK) for their bright idea to moot the\ntimely organization. The need for such a support\norganization can hardly be over emphasised.\nRecent reports have indicated\nthat there are about 300,000 orphans whose\nparents have died of Aids.\nIt is not hard to foresee a situation where\nthese children will be too many to handle. It is\nmuch like the number of street children which\nhas now reached almost explosive levels. \nThe gravity of the plight of these children is\nsuch that at the time of the death of their\nparents, they had already' depleted all their\nresources on treatment. Most leave behind\nnothing for their children.\nAs if...that is not enough, some of the orphans\nare themselves HIV positive having\ncontracted the virus from their mothers prior\nto birth or after. Such children, along with\nbeing without parents to support them, need\nspecialised care.\nBut ours is a society wallowing deep in\napathy. The common maxim seems to be \"everybody\nfor himself and God for us all.\"\nIn the midst of all this, it is challenging to\nsee that we still have among us people like the\nconvenors of AOSOK, who are ready to sacrifice\na lot to see that these children whom\nsociety cares little about are well supported.\nPresently this organisation caters for at\nleast 500 orphans. The needs of these children\nare colossal. They need food, clothing, shelter,\nschool fees, not to mention love and tender\ncare ..\nNeedless to stress, this new organization\ndeserves the support, materially. morally and\notherwise, or the government, N'GO's, private\ncompanies and all people of goodwill.\nPeter K. Muriuki,\nNairobi."}
