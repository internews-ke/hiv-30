{"text": "Another body joins fight against disease\nMore support to combat Aids\nThe recent launching of Family Health International (FHI) regional headquarters for Africa\nis another indicator that there\nis an urgent need for Kenya\nand ether poor nations to continue\npaying close attention to\nthe prevention of Aids and\npopulation boom.\nThe Minister for Health,' Mr\nJoshua Angatia, made it clear\nthat population boom and Aids\nare issues with roots and ramifications\nthat extend beyond the health sector.\nMr Angatia, who was particularly\nconcerned about Aids,\nsaid: \"We welcome FHI and\npledge our support because\nAids \u00b7threatens to destroy the\nvery foundation of our nation\nand Africa as whole by afflicting\nyouthful generation which\nis the source of labour, skills\nand future leadership.\"\nAlthough the impact of Aids\nis becoming more devastating,\nthe country is doing well in its\nfamily planning programmes.\nKenya's population growth rate\nof 3.8 per cent per annum,\nwhich was among the highest\nin the world, is now approaching\n3 per cent, according to the\nMinister.\nHowever, the health problems\nfacing Africa are unlimited\nand the situation has been\nworsened by Aids, drought and\neconomic decline.\nEven in a nation like Kenya,\nwhich for decades boasted of\nincreasing life expectancy -\nfrom around 42 years three decades\nago to 59 years now -\nboth curative and preventive\nhealth services face major\nproblems, including shortage of\nessential medicine and\nequipment.\nHowever, Kenya is still lucky\nbecause it still attracts various\ninternational health and\nhuman development\norganisations like FHI, a leading\ninternational non-profit\nbiomedical research and technical\nassistance organisation.\nIts activities basically aim at\npromoting health, prevention\nof diseases, reduction of poverty and related environmental problems caused by population\nboom.\nThe organisation is specifically\ninvolved in reproductive\nhealth, contraceptive development,\nsexually transmitted diseases\n(STDs) and Aids prevention,\nmaternal and child health.\nThe activities and impact of\nFHI go beyond mere promotion\nof family planning.\nWith the Aids virus threatening\nthe survival and socioeconomic\nwell-being of millions\nof people, especially in the development\nnations,. FHI\nlaunched its Aids Control and\nPrevention Project\n(AIDSCAP) to help cope with\nthe unfolding disaster.\nThe AIDSCAP gained immediate\nwidespread support and\nin August 1991 the United\nStates Agency for International\nDevelopment (USAid) offered a\nfive-year grant of Shll.4 billion\n($168 million).\nThe AIDSCAP's activities\ninclude improving the treatment\nof sexually transmitted\ndiseases, curbing of high risk\nbehaviour, better access and\nuse of condoms.\nIn Kenya, the work includes\nimproved prevention and treatment\nof STDs, increasing\ncollaboration among related'\nagencies, encouraging policy\nmakers to exercise leadership\nroles in the prevention of Aids\nand other STDs.\nThere is also a major element\nof communication to reduce\nhigh risk behaviour.\nTime, money, manpower and\nother resources can be effectively\nused if Aids and STD\nprevention services are integrated\ninto family planning in\nclinics and AIDSCAP is offering\nthe appropriate support.\nHowever, according to information\nfrom AIDSCAP, the\ndanger posed by Aids to Africa\nis reflected in the fact that a\nnation like Ethiopia, which had\nits first Aids case in 1986, will\nthis year have at least 536,000\npeople infected with the Aids\nvirus while Nigeria, which last\nyear had 917 Aids cases, is estimated to have 530,000 carriers\nof the lethal virus.\n. In Senegal, the Aids epidemic\nis at an explosive stage and it\nwill soon join nations like\nKenya and many others where\nthere is no more talk of Aids\nbeing confined to certain areas\nor groups.\nSenegal has the two types of\nthe virus - HIV-1 and HIV-2 -\namong the general population.\nHowever, one of the most appropriate aspects\nof AIDSCAP\nin Africa is that it is not run by\noutsiders.\nIndeed, the international director\nof the five-year USAID\nfunded project is Dr Peter Lamptey from Ghana, one of the\ncontinent's leading experts in\nmatters related to Aids prevention,\nfamily planning, nutrition\nand other public health issues\nhaunting developing nations.\nThe director of the new\nAIDSCAP Africa regional office\nin Nairobi is Dr Godfrey\u00b7\nSikipa, who has been a Permanent\nSecretary in the Ministry\nof Health in Zimbabwe, while'\nhis deputy, Dr Debrework\nZewdie, 'has worked as the head\n.of Ethiopia's Aids and STDs\nprevention and control\nprogramme before she came to\nNairobi.\nKenyans stand a unique chance of directly and indirectly\ngaining from such important\nagencies and already AIDSCAP\nis offering technical support to\nthe National Aids Control\nProgramme.\nDr Lamptey, accompanied\nby Ms Joann Lewis, who heads\npopulation service of FHI,\ntravelled from the US to\nNairobi to attend the launching\nof Africa regional office.\nHe said that the Aids epidemic\nhad forced the society to\nlook at issues that had previously\nnot been addressed such\nas the role of women in sexual\nnegotiation, .modification of\nsexual behaviour and control of\nSTDs.\nThere is need for better and\nappropriate programmes designed\nto prevent the spread of\nHIV among populations, the\ndoctor said.\n\"Programmes that involve\nbehaviour modification are always\ndifficult. Aids involves\nsexual behaviour and is a highly\npoliticised and emotional\nhealth and social problem.\nTherefore its prevention will be\nslow,\" he added.\nThe head of AIDSCAP said:\n\"We may not stop the Aids epidemic\nbut we may be able to\nslow down its spread although\ninadequacy of resources is also\nthe most important limitation\nfor effective control of HIV\nvirus.\nDr Lamptey said that Africans\nshould begin taking the\nAids scourge seriously and be\nwilling to acquire loans to help\ncontrol the disease which is already\na major development\nissue ..\nZaire and Brazil are two examples\nof nations that acquired\nloans from the World Bank to\nhelp deal with Aids, and other\nAfrican nations may have to\ncopy the example to curb full\ndependency on donors.\nDr Lamptey said there was\nincreasing acceptability in the\nuse of condoms in many countries,\nand cited Tanzania where\n. the use of condoms went up\nfrom 50 per cent to 91 per cent\nfor women by 1989. Indeed, the effort to prevent\nthe spread of Aids in Africa is\nreflected in the increase of condom sales which jumped from\nbelow one million in 1988 to 64\nmillion in 1992.\nThe doctor said that there\nare still nations that have policies\nthat hinder effort in the\nwar against Aids which\nmay have no proven cure even\nby the end of the decade.\nHe recommended removal of\nfees associated with Aids education\nand also public service\npromotion in the media, while\nimport duties and taxes on\ncondoms and drugs used to\ntreat sexually transmitted diseases should also be eliminated.\nThe use of condoms is one of\nhe preventive measures which\nhas not been associated with a increased immorality as some people seem to suggest, Dr Lamptey .said.\nHe said that treatment of\nSTDs, including genital ulcers,\nis important in the war against\nAids and there is also an urgent .\nneed to remove restrictions on\npromotion condoms and condom\nuse in the mass media.\nMs \u00b7Joann, who is in charge\nof population services, said that\nalthough condoms were initially\nintended for family planning,\nthe use has extended to the\nprevention of sexually transmitted\ndiseases and it is the only\navailable protection\nagainst the Aids virus if used\nproperly.\nShe said that the population\nprogramme is actually concerned about all aspects of reproductive health, including\nsafety and effectiveness in family planning products.\n\"However, we are also now in the position to help in the testing of any new 'anti-Aids vaccines\nafter an agreement with the US\nNational Institute of Health,\"\nshe added.\nThe new FHI Africa headquarters\nis at the Chancery, off\nValley Road. Those present\nduring the opening included Mr\nJohn Westley, who is the mission director of USAid."}
