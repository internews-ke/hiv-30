{"text": "Is God wiping\nout generation?\nAn article in the Daily Nation of\nJune 23,has prompted me to ask\nwhether God is wiping out a\nwhole generation through Aids.\nThe article quoted Dr Tamar\nJehvda's remark during a recent\nlecture at the University of\nNairobi that a person testing\nHIV negative under the Elisa test\nmay paradoxically be infected\nwith the HIV virus.\nThe question which cropped up\nand which must be taken seriously\nis: How can one be infected by\nthe Aids virus and yet test\nnegative?\nIt is alarming that the percentage\nof pregnant women infected\nwith the Aids virus is very high.\nThe high rate of infection among\npregnant women is a strong indicator\nthat the virus is already\nwreaking havoc here and all over\nthe world and everything should\nbe done to curb its spread, especially\namong the young people.\nTo curb the Aids menace, the\nchorus about the use of condoms\nor adhering to moral ethics is not\nenough and seems to have lost\nmeaning.\nTo make things worse. the\nquestion of the use of condoms\ncannot apply to those who are\nnewly married since they will argue\nthey want to have children.\nThe best solution for young\nmen and women may be to forget\nabout marriage altogether.\nOne might ask: What shall we\nthen do about sex? Some claim\nthat they cannot do without sex.\nOne solution is to have male babies\nand all young men turned\ninto \"eunuchs\".\nIn the case of females, one may\nremove erogenous hormones.\nThere is no other way of dealing\nwith this dreaded disease. Research\ninto this mysterious disease\nshows that it is not a\nblessing but a curse to this\ngeneration.\nEven testing before marriage is\nnot a sure precaution, considering\nDr Tamar's presentation.\nI may be wrong, but since it\nseems that this generation has\nflouted the law that God gave\nconcerning sex, God may have\ndecided to wipe it out.\nWhat young men and women\ncan do now to show remorse is to\nforget sex and marriage.\n\u2022\u2022\u2022 Otieno Obonyo,\nKisumu"}
