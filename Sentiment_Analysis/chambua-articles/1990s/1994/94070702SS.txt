{"text": "Unknown virus kills forty lions\nBy ZEPHANIA UBWANI\nScientists are still divided on the\ncause of death of at least 40 lions\nin the Serengeti National Park,\nnorthern Tanzania since the beginning\nof this year.\nThe chief veterinary officer\nwith the Tanzania National\nParks (Tanapa), Dr Melody\nRoelke, was quoted by the press\nlast week linking the deaths to\ncanon distemper virus (CDV)\nwhich in dogs and cats attack\nthe nervous system. '\nAccording to her, the preliminary\ntests by researchers in the\narea indicated signs that the lions\ncould have been infected by the\nfeline immunodeficiency virus\n(FlY), a viral group with characteristics\nsimilar to human immunodeficiency\nvirus (HIV) which\ntriggers aids in human beings.\nAt least 40 lions have died in\nSerengeti, one of the largest\nmammal parka in the world, since\nearly February, in what has been\ndescribed as viral infection. Moet.\nof the deaths occurred in the\nsouth eastern put of park.\nIt is feared that the mysterious\ndisease could spread to other.\nparts of the park and infect other\nanimals like hyenas and jackals.\nA research conducted on 200 lions\nfound that blood samples of\n60 of them showed CDV\ninfection.\nAbout 3,000 lions still roam the\nSerengeti park which borders the Maasai-Mara Park in southwestern\nKenya: But, according to\nthe \"New Scientist,\" some of the\nlargest prides have been wiped\nout by the epidemic.\nQuoting Dr Craig Packer of the\nUniversity of Minnesota who directs\na project to monitor lions in\nthe park, the weekly magazine\nsays about 80 per cent of the animals\nwere dying.\nResearches observing the\ndeaths say the animals stagger as\nif drunk, often wandering away\nfrom their pride before falling\nwith massive convulsions.\nThe scientists are now closely\nobserving lions which show neurological\nsymptoms, including a\ntwitching sneer on one half of the\nface and paws that flail when\nthey lie on their backs.\n\"They are unsure whether lions\nwith these symptoms have\nsurvived the disease with some\nneurogical damage or whether\nthey are still in early stage\" the\nmagazine said.\nAlready the Tanzanian park\nauthorities are concerned by the\nmysterious deaths. Posters\nthroughout the park instruct\ntourists to report any lion exhibiting\nstrange behaviour.\nSo far, pathologists have ruled\nout rabies and feline leukaemia\nvirus. However, the agents that\ncause the disease usually have a\nvery long incubation period, making\nrabies unlikely diagnosis.\n\nFree treatment\nBy OCHIENG' SINO\nThe Maasai in Nyonyori, Kajiado\nDistrict, are today enjoying free\nmedical services offered by the\nInternational Community for the\nRelief of Starvation and Suffering\n(lCROSS).\nICROSS is a non governmental\norganisation providing community-\nbased health care and tries to\nimprove; economic well being of\npeople living in the hardship regions\nof Africa.\nIts activities include control of\ninfectious diseases, income generation\nprojects, general primary\nhealth care and water development\nfor 'the desert and semi\ndesert communities of sub Sahara\nAfrica.\nThe provincial administration\nofficials are doing their best to\nmobilise the people to visit the health centre.\nThere are three community\nhealth workers and 30 traditional\nbirth attendants taking care of\nabout 60 patients who visit\nNyonyori ICROSS Health Centre\neach day.\nMr Lawrence Owaya, one of\ntbe community nurses at the\ncentre, says since the facility was\nestablished in 1985, more and\nmore people are embracing the\nidea of a healthy and improved\nenvironment.\nMalaria is the most prevalent\ndisease here, but there are also\ncases of trachoma, pneumonia,\nseIually transmitted diseases and\ndiarrhea reported at the centre.\nA programme on family planning\nservices is being run alongside\nawareness campaign on Aids\nalready affecting the Maasai."}
