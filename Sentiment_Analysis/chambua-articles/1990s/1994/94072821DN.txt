{"text": "Date: DAILY NATION, THURSDAY, JULY 28, 1994\n\nAn Aids epidemic looms\non Indian sub-continent\nNew Delhi India\nAids is racing through India just\neight years after the first case\nwas detected.\nProstitutes, drug addicts and\nuntested blood supplies are the\nconduits.\nMore than half of the prostitutes\nin cities such as Bombay\nhave HIV, the virus that causes\nAids. The lorry drivers and itinerant\nworkers they serve carry it\nto their villages.\nIn north-eastern India, 70 per\ncent of the estimated 30,000 intravenous\ndrug users have become\nHIV -positive.\nHundreds of private blood\nbanks rely heavily on professional\ndonors, poor people who survive\nby selling their blood. Seldom\nare the donations properly\ntested for Aids.\nThe HIV virus has been reported\nin all 25 states. Although\nthe Aids pandemic came later to\nIndia than to most large countries,\nthe National Aids Control\nOrganisation estimates there\nwere 1.62 million cases in the\npopulation of 880 million, up 60\nper cent from 1993.\nIf India follows the path of\nsub-Saharan Africa, the Aids epicenter,\nthat number could grow\nto 10 million by the decade's end,\naccording to 'World Health Organisation\nauthorities.\n\"Aids is no longer just a problem\nof high-risk groups. It has\nspread to every area of India,\" Dr\nP.R. Das Gupta of the National\nAids Agency said in an interview.\n\"So many people are migrating\nfrom their villages in search of\njobs that this epidemic is spreading\nvery fast.\"\nFew countries face as many obstacles\nin combating Aids.\nMedical facilities are so inadequate\nin rural areas that hundreds\nof thousands of Indians die\neach year of cholera, measles, tuberculosis\nand other easily curable\ndiseases.\nMalnutrition leaves millions\nwith weak immune systems. In a\nnation where 43 million cases of\nSexually Transmitted Diseases\n(STDs) are reported each year,\neven faithful married women\nhave untreated infections of the\nreproductive tract that make\nthem susceptible to Aids.\nIndian doctors often refuse to\ntreat patients with Aids for fear\nof catching it. Many people still\nbelieve wrongly that the HIV virus\ncan be spread through a\nhandshake, that it is unsafe to\nride on a bus or work beside an\ninfected person.\nSex has traditionally been a taboo\nsubject in India and homosexuality\nis still illegal. There is\nlittle research on sexual\nbehaviour to help direct the fight\nagainst Aids.\nThat means no one knows\nwhether commonly accepted assumptions\nare true: that India is\nless vulnerable than the promiscuous\nWest because sex before\nmarriage is uncommon, and that\nonly the poor and uneducated\nbuy sex.\nFew politicians are willing to\ndiscuss Aids publicly because the \nofficial number of reported\ndeaths - 713 - reinforces the\npopular notion that there is no\ncrisis.\nMost experts on Aids dismiss\nthe official figure as absurdly low,\nbut none has a reliable estimate.\nThe World Bank, which gave\nIndia US$ 84 million loan in 1992\nto finance anti-Aids programmes,\nrecently complained to the government\nthat some states had not\nyet put the money to use.\nNearly half of all Indians are\nilliterate, so educating them\nabout any complicated subject is\ndifficult. State-run television carries\nfew warnings or programmes\nabout Aids.\nEffective education is vital in a\nmale-dominated society where\nfew men use condoms and few\nwomen - wives as well as prostitutes\n- would dare ask them to.\nAn investigation of unusually\nhigh demand for government supplied\ncondoms among long distance\ntruck drivers in southern\nIndia revealed that they were\nbeing used to plug radiator leaks. -\nBirth-control programmes\nhave had uneven success in India,\nwhich is expected to surpass China\nas the world's most populous\nnation early in the next century.\nThe government is trying to\nmake sure all men will have access\nto reliable condoms.\nBombay is one of several large\ncities where poor, illiterate girls\nare kidnapped or sold by their families\nto work as prostitutes.\nAt least 100,000 women work\nin Bombay's 25 red\u00b7 light districts.\nActivists trying to help\nthem say the women cannot afford\nto turn away customers who\nrefuse to use condoms.\nMany of those customers are\nlorry drivers or migrant day labourers\nwho use prostitutes in\nthe city, then return to their\n. wives in the villages ..\nThe situation is even worse in\nthe north-eastern states of Manipur,\nNagaland and Mizoram,\nwhich border Burma and southeast\nAsia's infamous Golden Triangle\ndrug-producing region. _~\nThere, heroin is as popular as cigarettes\nand often cheaper than\nalcohol.\nI Many addicts belong to tribes\nin which sharing is a tradition.\nThat now includes sharing needles,\nwhich spreads the Aids\nvirus.\nState governments in the\nnortheast, faced with tribal uprisings\nfor autonomy or independence,\nhave given low priority to\nAids.
