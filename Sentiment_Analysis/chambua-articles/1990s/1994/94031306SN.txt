{"text": "A good fight that\nCatholics can't win\nWriting in a London magazine recently of Aids in Uganda\nand the attitude of the churches, a reporter concluded with\nthis biting sting in the tail: \"The World Health\nOrganisation estimates there will be 5.5 million orphans in central and east Africa by the year 2000. Will the Vatican please promise to care for them all?\"\nLet us say right off, this column is not intended as a\ncondemnation of the Catholic Church, whose efforts for the people of Africa are unrivalled - Witness the graves off thousands of priests and nuns who gave their lives for the spiritual and temporal welfare of the continent.\nWhat we wish to do is to focus thinking anew on attitudes\ntowards morality and sex in the face of changing behavior by young people and the overwhelming threat of sexually\ntransmitted diseases, Aids in particular.\nA recent seminar of 300 Nairobi adolescents argued\nstrongly for the traditional cause: No sex before marriage,\nno sex education in schools, no contraceptives, no abortion, no pornography, increased religious education.\nThey referred to 'teenage moral decadence\" and\n\"increased immorality\" and accused some teachers of\nhaving \"the morality of alley cats.\"\nIt is difficult to know how representative air these views,\ncouched in the language of 19th Century fire-and-brimstone revivalism, of the youth of Kenya generally, but we suspect not very.\nSurveys which show that the average young person\nbecomes sexually active at 14 and that some 10,000 Kenyan girls drop out of school each year because they are pregnant would suggest the views set out above have made little impression on the totality of young folks.\nThis is not to say the traditionalist view should be\ndisregarded. Indeed there is a strong argument that by and\nlarge it should prevail, so powerful are its moral precepts\nand so valid have they proved for the good of family and\n- society down the years.\nBut in areas where four out of five young adult deaths are due to Aids, as in some parts of East Africa, the question\nmust be asked whether traditional ideology is any longer\nsufficient in the face of changing attitudes and the HIV\npandemic.\nEvidence indicates that two-thirds of Aids infections are\nincurred before the age of 25. To deny these young people\naccess to condoms, as some moralistic heavyweights would\ndo, is to condemn them to flirt with death.\nEqually, to refuse to tell children in school of the dangers\nthat face them when their bodies mature and their\nprocreational instincts quicken is to place them in appalling danger .\u2022\nContrary to views usually held by this school of thought,\nsex education does not lead to orgiastic experimentation.\nIndeed, as a Unicef official wrote in the Daily Nation\nyesterday, surveys have shown that it neither increases the\nfrequency of sexual activity nor lowers the age at which sex first takes place. Actually, the opposite is usually the case.\nThere is no doubt that the first and most successful line\nof defense against HIV infection would be to follow the\ntraditional teaching of the church and persons of heroic\nvirtue: Abstinence before marriage and strict monogamy\nafterwards. Certainly as prophylactics go, you cannot do\nbetter than that.\nBut setting aside the inability of some human beings to\nadhere to such conditions, there are also complications that are peculiar to Africa. Inquiring about past sexual habits before marriage is something, for instance, that most Africans would have problems handling. Women frequently do not have the authority or cultural backing to ensure their own protection.\n.As for the chastity-before-marriage/fidelity-after rule\nmany people, both religious and non-religious, will echo\nthose words in the Bible: \"This is a hard saying and who\ncan believe it?\"\nIdealistic as the preaching is, reaching for the finest\npeaks of human behaviour, many young people, especially\nthe not-yet-marrieds, will seek a less stony path. Where\nwould be the morality in denying them access to .condoms in the knowledge that infection, cross-infection, endless illness, death and the orphaning of babies could be the result? .\nThere\u00b7 is no doubt that in an ideal world, the\ntraditionalist's is the ideal solution. But people have to deal with the world the way they find it. It's no secret that in the real world of Aids-stricken Africa, some Catholic Church workers inform parents\u00b7 of the advantages of the condom and ensure they know where they are available.\nThey probably believe that a hugely over-populated\ncontinent would be happier with one less baby, whatever\nmoral theology says, than with a whole family of sick and\ndying people, babies included. Who is to say they are\nwrong?"}
