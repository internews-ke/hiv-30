{"text": "Kenyans misinformed on debate\nI wish to refer to the letters entitled \"Vital\nmeeting denied publicity\" (Nation, July 11)\nby Miriam Mutebi and Laila Malik and a\nrejoinder entitled \"Population conference\nprofane\" (Nation, July 29) by Cleophas\nWanyonyi.\nI concur that this vitally important international\nconference has not been given the publicity\nit deserves in the Kenyan media. Likewise,\nthe population and development debates.\nthat have been raging elsewhere in the world\nare almost unheard of on the Kenyan scene.\nLittle wonder the public seems to be ill informed\nabout the conference.\nFor a start, I do hope that the three writers\nare familiar' with the Draft Programme of\nAction for the Cairo Conference.\nThe \u00b7conference is not an isolated event but\na logical follow-up to the 1974 World Population\nConference and the 1984 International\nConference on Population in Mexico City.\nThe overall theme of the conference is population,\nsustained economic growth and sustainable\ndevelopment.\nThe original UN Draft Document has been\nreviewed over and over again by as many\ngovernment delegations and other non-governmental\nand women-related NGOs as\npossible.\nI wish to draw to the attention of Mutebi,\nMalik and Wanyonyi to the Draft Final Document\nof the conference. The Draft\n.Programme of Action is an important document worthy of serious thought and reflection.\nIt builds upon the considerable international\nconsensus which has developed since\n1984.\nAdditionally, the 1994 conference was explicitly\ngiven a broader mandate than the earlier\npopulation conferences, reflecting the\ngrowing global awareness that population\nchange, poverty, inequality in resources allocation,\npatterns of consumption and threats\nto the environment are closely\ninterconnected.\nThe conference calls for far greater investment\nin people as the most imp6rtant factor\nfor bringing about sustainable development\nand for a new action agenda to make women\nfull partners with men in the social, economic\nand political lives of their communities:\nTo this effect women and women-related\n. non-governmental organisations the world\nover have added their voices to the population\nand development debates and most of the\nconcerns and perspectives have been incorporated\nin the document.\nAdmittedly, controversial issues such as\nsexual and reproductive healths, family planning,\nadolescent health, condom distributional\nuse, safe motherhood, safe abortion, safe sex,\nsexual orientation and marital status, sexual\neducation and reproductive health services\nand contraception, etc., for which consensus\nwere not achieved are still bracketed.\nI must, however, point out that the revised\nProgramme of Action to be released at the Cairo conference makes no direct mention of\nthe following issues:\nReduction of the population level of\nThird World..\nCoercive family planning policies by\ngovernment.\nRemoval of all barriers to abortion.\nAlienation of men/fathers or male responsibility\nand participation.\nPromoting abortion as a means of family\nplanning.\nDirect reference to lesbians and\nhomosexuals.\nAdvocating artificial fertilisation for\nthose who are sterile and lesbians.\nAdvocating the use of contraceptives I\ncondoms from age of 10 years, etc.\nThe conference document does not set itself\nto prescribe promiscuity judging by its\nSTDs and HIV/Aids control and prevention.\nOne of its objectives is to \"address adolescent\nreproductive health issues, including unplanned\npregnancy, unsafe abortion, HIV infections\nand Aids and other sexually\ntransmitted diseases, through the promotion\nof healthy reproductive and sexual behaviour\nand to substantially reduce adolescent pregnancies\nwithin as well as outside marriage.\"\nIn no way does the conference promote antisocial\nbehaviour by children and youth, as\nWanyonyi claims.\nDr Catherine A.
