{"text": "SATURDAY FEBRUARY 12 1994\n\nEducate athletes on the dangers of Aids\u2028\n The term \"HIV disease\" describes\nall manifestations of infection\nprior to the development\nof Aids, whereas Aids is the fatal\ne of HIV infection.\ne majority of people infected\nwith HIV appear healthy, lead\nnormal lives and are unaware\nthat they are infected. Most authorities\nbelieve all patients infected\nwith HIV will eventually\ndevelop Aids and that HIV infection\nis ultimately fatal 100 per\ncent. The response to the disease\ndiffers from one individual to another;\napproximately 50 per cent\nof HIV infected patients develop\nAids within eight years of infection.\nHowever, more recently one,\ntwo and five year survival rates\nfor Aids are 50 per cent 30 per\ncent and 15 per cent respectively.\nAgain, recent promising new\nmedications and treatments can\nprolong the asymptomatic state\nof HIV disease and life span of\nAids patients.\nAthletes need to be told the\nkind of persons who are more at\nrisk thus should be cautious in\ntheir dealings with such persons.\n\u2022 The homosexuals or bisexual males.\n\u2022 Intravenous drug abusers -\nthis group is responsible for a significant\nportion of the heterosexual\nspread of HIV.\n\u2022 Prostitutes and those who frequent\nthem.\n\u2022 Blood transfusion recipients.\n\u2022 Unprotected sexual contacts of\nany member of the above listed\nfirst four groups.\nWhereas activities like body\nmassage, hugging, petting, dry kissing\nand mutual masturbation\nmay be regarded as safe, others\nlike wet-kissing, urine contact\nwith skin, penile-vaginal contact\nwith condom before ejaculation\nare just probably considered safe.\nOther activities which are considered\njust possibly safe are orovaginal\ncontact, penile-vaginal contact with condom and ejaculation\nand ano-genital contact with\ncondom among others.\nHowever, ano-manual contact,\noral or anal contact with urine\nand both ano-genial and penile vaginal\ncontact without condoms\nare definitely unsafe.\nBasically, as has been said time\nand again, HIV transmission occurs\nwhen body fluids of an infected\nindividual are exchanged\nwith those of an uninfected individual.\nThe most common primary\nvectors include blood and\nblood products, semen, vaginal\nsecretions, breast milk and amniotic\nfluid found in a pregnant\nuterus.\nThough HIV has been cultured\nin saliva and tears, there is not\nany documented evidence indicating\nthese are a cause for\ninfection.\nThe highest risk are individuals\nwithout condoms engaging\nin receptive and insertive\nanogenital sex and women engaging\nin penile-vaginal contact\nwithout condoms.\nAthletes involved in unsporting\nactivities like the use of anabolic\n\nsteroids risk transmission when\nthey share needles. Tatoo application\nat parlours that do not use\ndisposable needles or adequately\nsterilize needless between clients\nalso presents a needle transmission\nrisk.\nThough be risk of infection is\nthere on the field, the major risk\nif off the field. It is more or less\nan established fact that professional\nand high profile athletes at\n. all levels often have abundant\nsexual opportunities. It has been\nquoted recently in an Aids bulletin\nthat a woman who had admitted\nhaving had sexual relations\nwith about 50 national hockey\nleague placers in Canada had\ndied of Aids.\nDue to the fatality of this disease\nand the rate at which it is .\nspreading, It is imperative that\nemphasis be placed on prevention.\nIt is important to tell athletes\nthat Abstinence is the only\nfool proof method to prevent\nHIV transmit ion However,\nsince the majority of high school\nstudents and most adults are sexually\nactive and thus unlikely to\nabstain from sex, information on -practicing safe, sex may have\nmore impact.\nAvoiding promiscuity and\nchoosing non-promiscuous sexual\npartners greatly decreases the\nrisk of HIV transmission.\nCondoms offer the best protection\nfrom HIV transmission during\nvaginal or anal intercourse,\nand it is estimated that the risk is\nreduced from 1:500 to 1:5,000.\nIt is worth noting that natural\nmembrane condoms may provide\na more natural feel than latex\ncondoms, but they do not provide\na barrier to some sexually transmitted\ndiseases including Hepatitis\n'B' and HIV disease.\nSome other condoms are lubricated\nto prevent tearing during\nfriction. However, some are prelubricated\nwith a spermicidalliquid,\nand this adds an additional\nprotection as an HIV barrier\nsince nonoxynol-9 inactivates\nHIV thus may provide some protection\nin case the condom\nruptures.\nAthletes who have engaged in\nhigh risk behaviour should be\nasked to voluntarily be te8ted as\nthis will eventually benefit them\nin the sense that if they test\npositive;\n\u2022 They may get access to the numerous\nmedication now available\nto prolong their lives.\n\u2022 They will exercise control of\nHIV transmission to their sex\npartners.\n\u2022 They will enrol in a one-on-one\ncounselling for more specific patient\neducation.\n\u2022 They may get peace of mind as\na result of being more knowledgeable\nabout HIV status.\nIt should be emphasized that\nthe HIV -infected athletes should\navoid putting others at risk. It is\nimportant that physicians keep\nan open forum regarding educating\nand counselling athletes \"-\nabout Aids, this should be a con- ..\u2022 __\ntinuous process. Caution should\nbe of paramount importance in\nsituations where bloody injuries\nOcelli'as in boxing or wrestling\namong'\u00b7 others.\nFresh bleach Solution muat be\nused to clean bloody equipment ..-.,\nand surfaces like wrestling~mats\nbefore play is resumed. All exposed\nwounds should be well\ncovered ."}
