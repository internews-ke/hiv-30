{"text": "Our hope lies reformist change\nSometimes it seems that we Africans are so mesmerised by\nfigures and acronyms - SAPs, GDPs, GNPs, economic/\ninflation/interest/currency/growth rates and the rest - that\nwe lose sight of farther-reaching policies and priorities.\nWhatever is the sacred cow of the moment (liberalisation\nperhaps, economic reform or structural adjustment)\nbecomes the be-all and end-all of public life; a state of\nNirvana will be achieved, the fashionable belief goes, if only\nKenyans worship. long and humbly enough before the\ncurrent economic dogma.\nWe are not, in adopting this sardonic vein, suggesting\nthat economic reform is not the way ahead for Kenya - God\nforbid; our nation has lacked discipline and vision in its\neconomic and financial policies for far too long and now\nthat most of our managers and planners appear committed\nto the path of integrity and self-restraint, we pray as\ndevoutly as the rest that this will lead us to the promised\nland.\nIn passing, we might just ponder the irony that it is, as\never, the poor who pay the price, tightening their belts\nunder the demands of SAPs made necessary because of\nlaxity; greed and mismanagement by Kenyans who do not\nknow what it is to go hungry - and, in fairness, by some\npainful recessionary conditions around the globe.\nWe trust that the Government will have the strength of\nwill, whatever socio-political problems accrue, to sustain\nthe painful measures it has already accepted are necessary\nto cure our economic ills. It. is essential, in Kenya, as in\nother sub-Saharan countries, to break out of the cycle of\ndwindling growth and rising inflation and population.\nFinger-in-the-dyke policies must be a thing of the past;\nwell-managed economies and poverty-reducing strategies\nmust take priority in our thinking.\nThe alternative is becoming too ghastly to contemplate.\nRecent Swedish research suggests that the poor in sub-\nSaharan Africa will increase by almost 50 per cent to 265\nmillion in the year 2000. This will be a third of all the\ndeveloping world's poor.\nThe continent cannot sustain this sort of degradation and\nthe risks of conflagration, indeed revolution, are selfevident.\nAfrica's planners must start looking closely at\u00b7\nwhere resources are being used and whether they are best\nemployed in those areas.\nRecent data indicate that 27 out of 37 African countries\nspend more money on the military than on agriculture.\nThere are also outrageous imbalances between funds voted\nto ceremonial occasions, flying the flag and government PR\nand those set aside for social welfare programmes.\n.With so many unsolved problems ahead, now is the time\nto .debate whether more funds should not be put into\nimportant areas of research, particularly scientific\ninvestigation, perhaps also \"think-tanks\" - no matter how\nextravagant such an idea may seem to the tight-lipped\nfinancial controller.\nSuch demands are usually far down the priority lists of\nAfrican governments because research is slow, academic,\nhard to understand difficult to communicate to the cash providers\nand rarely; achieves swift, spectacular or visible\nresults. If you want to impress, it is much easier to tarmack\na road or build a clinic.\nThe argument of the researchers is that the road might be\nprovided quicker, the clinic not even needed if they were\nallowed to pursue their studies whilst generously funded\nand free of political interference. Look at the possibilities:\nInsect- and plant-related research are crucial to the\nfuture of agriculture while farmers are waiting for cost\neffective and home grown technologies.\nThere is a whole field of animal diseases and behaviour\ncrucial to African agriculture demanding serious\nexploration from home-grown scientists ..\nWhen it comes to diseases in humans, the continent need\nlook no further than Aids. Horrifying figures are released\nalmost daily about the effects of the HIV epidemic, one\nbeing that it is reducing Africa's Gross Domestic Product by\nsomewhere between 15 and 25 per cent.\n. All the world's researchers seem to be working frantically\nfor an Aids cure. It can do no harm if Africa's brightest\nminds join in the quest to end a scourge which seems to.\nhave attacked Africa with particular Virulence ..\nThe brain drain problem could be ameliorated by the\ngrowth of indigenous research institutions to offer\nconditions and challenges equal to those being met by\nyoung Africans in greener pastures overseas.\nResearch institutions will have to sustain constructive\ndialogue with the scientific establishments and the policy\nmakers and there is no reason why this should not be\nachieved. Given idealism, sensible financial control and\ncommitment from government, Africa could take a major\nstep forward in confronting its own multifarious problems."}
