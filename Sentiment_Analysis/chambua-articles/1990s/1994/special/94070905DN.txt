{"text": "Aids: Voi tops in district\nBy EMMANUEL MWERO\nVoi town leads in the number of\nAids cases reported in Taita-\nTaveta District, a Government\nreport says.\nThis, according to the report, is\ndue to the high population and\nbecause of its position on the\nmain Mombasa-Nairobi highway\nwhich makes' it a convenient\nstopover for heavy commercial vehicle drivers and tourists. The\ndistrict development plan (1994-\n1996) says that until recently,\nmost cases of HIV/Aids were\nconfined to major urban centres,\nbut the trend has changed and\nsmaller town centres are also\naffected,\nThe first case was diagnosed in\n1988. Since then, the rise hi the\nnumber of cases has been steady."}
