{"text": "AIDS UPDA IE\nWill this new 'discovery' bring hope for Africans?\nBy OTULA OWUOR,\nScience Editor\nNews from Africa about \"discoveries\"\nof various substances or strategies which can be used to treat or curb the killer disease\nAids, get minimal attention.\nThe continent's medical researchers\nhave \"burnt\" their fingers over the last eight years.\nThus news from Malawi to the\neffect that transmission of the\nAids virus from mother to child\ncould be drastically\u00b7 -reduced by\nincreased intake\u00b7 of vitamin A has\nbeen accorded a rather low key\nreception.\nThe news item was carried in\nThe Lancet, a leading weekly\nmedical journal from Britain.\nIndeed, a few local researchers\nhave made it clear that they may\nnot rush to conduct similar research\nthough vitamin A is easily\nobtained from carrots, green vegetables,\nliver and milk ..\nHowever, the June 25 issue of .\nThe Lancet, says a two-year\nstudy of 567 pregnant women\ninfected with the Aids virus\nshowed that only seven per cent\nof those with a high concentration\nof vitamin A in their blood,\ntransmitted it to their babies\ncompared to 32 per cent of those\nwith a minimum amount of the\n. vitamin.\nThe research which was conducted at Queen Elizabeth Hospital\nin Blantyre, Malawi, was\nheaded by Dr R.D. Semba from\nMalawi Medical College and five\nother experts from Johns Hopkins\nUniversity in the US.\nThere is no doubt that the inclusion\nof the team from the leading\nAmerican medical school\ngives the research results some of\nthe much needed \"international\ncredibility\" .\nHowever, when it comes to\nAids all top medical researchers\nseem to have made blunders and,\ntherefore, no group is exempt\nfrom skepticism.\nFor some analysts, the results\nof the Malawi study are too good\nto be true. Indeed, in Africa,\nwhere Aids is already a catastrophe,\nthe lives of millions of children\ncould finally be saved by\nsimply increasing the intake of\nvitamin A which is abundant.\nApart from being' found\nin common foodstuffs the vitamin is also available in tablet\nform. The vitamin is, in fact, already being used by most local\nand international health authorities\nwhich are aiming at curbing\ncertain forms of blindness.\nOne of the major health targets\nin Africa, according to mid-decade\ngoals of governments and\n. the United Nations Children's\nFund (Unicef)'::\" is the elimination of vitamin A deficiency and related health problems including blindness , especially in children.\nThose who closely monitor the\nworld of medicine know that\nJohns Hopkins University is also\na leading propagator of the benefits\nof vitamin A intake and the\nresults should be treated with\ncaution and could be due to overly\nenthusiastic researchers.\nHowever, Aids remains a leading\nkiller, causing misery and\npoverty\u00b7 \u00b7among families in both\nrural and urban areas.\nTherefore, any research, with\nresults indicating that there is a\nsubstance or method which can\nbe used to curb its spread, should\nbe encouraged and given close\nattention.\nThe results of the research remain\nimpressive especially when\nit shows that a deficiency of Vitamin\nA was associated with a\nthree to four-fold increased risk\nof mother-to-child transmission\nof the Aids virus which occurs\nduring pregnancy, delivery and\nbreast-feeding.\nHow does the vitamin reduce\ntransmission of the Aids virus\nfrom infected mother to the offspring.\nResearchers speculate\nthat the vitamin could be playing\na role in boosting immunity and\nmaintenance of mucosal surfaces\nor linings of various body organs\nand systems ..\nIt could thus be linked to reduction\nin the quantity of the virus\nescaping from the mother to\nthe baby. However, there is still\nan urgent need to examine certain\nbasic facts while others also\ntry similar experiments.\nPaediatric\nVitamin A could help in the\nfight against paediatric Aids epidemic\nespecially in Africa and\nnow Asia where between 20 to 40\nper cent of babies whose mothers\ncarry the Aids virus get infected\ncompared to developed nations,\nlike the US, with 10 to 20 per\ncent infection of such children.\nResearchers say that the levels\nof Vitamin A is higher in the\n. mothers living in the developed\nnations and this might be one of\nthe factors contributing to this\ndifference in percentages of\ninfections.\nThe results from Malawi follow\nthose of Kemron and, indeed, the\nvery first one from Zaire which\nwas code named MMI.\nThe people who discovered\nMMI made limited headway unlike\nKemron which is still being\ntested in the developed world.\nHowever, it is now clear that\nalthough Kemron could be having\nother positive effects, especially\nfor some people who say\nthat it helps improve the quality of their life, it is not a cure and\ncritics have tended to focus on\nthis deficiency of it.\nHowever, the war against Aids\nseems to be making limited headway.\nRecently, the World Health\nOrganization (WHO) said new\nvarieties of the lethal virus referred\nto as HIV-1 subtype O\nhave emerged in Cameroun, Gabon\nand France ..\nThus, authorities\u00b7 in areas\nwhere the subtype has been\nfound should urgently evaluate\ntheir diagnostic tests and strategies\nfor HIV blood tests.\nAids still generates much heat\nand there has been plenty during\nthe last month. First, the pro-\nThird World Boabab Press in\nWashington DC, recently said\nAids will soon depopulate Africa\nand that data is being manipulated\nto hide the potential trend towards\nthis alleged extinction.\nThe special report says \"although\nthe population of Cote d'\nIvoire is expected to reach 19 million\nby the year 2005,half of children\nunder 15years would also be\ninfected with the lethal virus and\nthe increase in population would\nbe quickly reversed as the next\ngeneration attains reproductive\nage. Many epidemiologists quietly\nsay that if 40 per cent of the sexually\nactive population are infected\nwith the Aids virus as in some\ncentral African cities, the population\nwill definitely decline\nsharply ..\nQuoting a Pentagon study, the\nBaobab Press says that up to 100\nmillion people could have been\ninfected with the Aids virus by\n1991 and 50 million will die in the\n1990s. Above all, the number\ncould double several times and\nwipe out some countries in 20\nyears.\nIn the tiny African island\nnation of Sao Tome and Principe,\ncases of Aids jumped from\n300 to 12,000 within a year and\nthe implications are grim.\nIn short, the Baobab Press is\nsaying the trend is clearly towards\na point of no return. The\nreport adds that those using data\nto show Aids will cause population\ndecline, ignore the fact there\nare also other major natural and\nman-made disasters which are\nkilling people in Africa.\nHowever, according to Prof\nLobe Monekosso,the WHO director for the Africa region, their\ndoomsday prediction should be\ntreated with caution.\n\"Such predictions are based\non extreme assumption that\npeople will do nothing to avoid\nbeing killed by the lethal virus\nand it cannot be true that we are\njust sitting watching helplessly,\nProf Monekosso said. \"Aids can be prevented _\ntaking certain measures that require individual, family, communal,\nnational, regional and international\neffort. With appropriate\ninformation, people can avoid\nhigh risk behaviour,\" Prof\nMonekosso, who had stopped in\nNairobi enroute to Rwanda, said.\nThe Baobab Press report is\nnothing compared to last week's\nstatements by the fire-spitting Dr <'\nJack Fielder, an American who\naccuses his country's germ warfare\nexperts, of genetically engineering\nthe Aids virus to kill or\ncontrol the population of certain\ncommunities, especially Africans.\nDr Fielder said that African researchers\nshould not wait for\ntheir Western counterparts to~\nsolve the problem.\n\"If we don't stop the Aids epidemic,\nwe will all die because all\nthe evidence clearly indicates\nthat the lethal virus was specifically\ndesigned to eliminate or\ncontrol the population of certain\u00b7\nhuman communities especially\nblacks,\" Dr Fielder said at a ..\ncent press conference in Nairobi.\nDr Fielder. has published a\nbook titled Aids, United States\nGerm Warfare At Its Best: With\nDocuments And Proof. History\nDr Fielder, who mixes science\nand history, warned Africans\nagainst taking things for granted\nbecause their tragic history - of\nslavery, colonisation, exploitation\nand other forms of misery -\ncould easily repeat itself by the\nturn of the century.\nThe American, who is visiting\nseveral African nations said an\nincreasing number of scientists\nagree that the Aids virus was genetically\nengineered by first combining viruses that infect sheep's\nbrain and those that cause leukemia\nin .livestock then \"growing\"\nthem m a mixture containing\nhuman white blood cells.\nLastly, finally, American and\nFrench scientists, who have been\nfighting over monetary gains resulting\nfrom patents given to\nthose who \"discovered\" the Aids\nvirus last week, agreed on how to\nshare what some critics call their\n\"blood stained loot\".\nThe US National Institute of\nHealth has earned $20 million\n(Sh1.2 billion) since 1987 while\nFrance's Pasteur Institute got\n$14 million (Sh770 million). The\nFrench are now expected to earn\n60 per cent of the patent money\nbefore its expiry in the year 2002.\nHowever, America's Robert\nGallo has given up as was expected.\nIt was quietly agreed that Luc Montagnier is the' real discoverer\" of the virus."}
