{"text": "MARCH 20, 1997\n\nHomosexuality and the spread of killer Aids\n\nHomosexuality has been the main\u2028\nmode of spread of Aids in America and Europe.\u2028\nHowever, although male-female sex has been the main mode\u2028\nof spread in Africa. it is worth not-\u2028\n\u00a1ng that homosexuality has existed in Kenya and has steadily\u2028\ngrown in recent times.\u2028\nFor example, about 27 years\u2028\nago, there was a young school\u2028\nteacher who was the receiving homosexual partner in a relationship\u2028\nwith a married man.\u2028\nThe young receiving partner\u2028\nwas so committed to his role that\u2028\nhe wanted to get married to his\u2028\npartner.\nHe then became impatient and\u2028\nasked to be referred lo a surgeon\u2028\nwho could carry out a sex-change\u2028\noperation. This is an operation\u2028\nwhich gets rid of the male sex organs and constructs with the\u2028\navi1ab1e skin, a semblance of female genitals.\u2028\nWith this in mind, the young\u2028\nman then left Kenya for Europe\u2028\nfrom where he underwent the sex-\u2028\nchange and then wrote to say that\u2028\nhe did not see any reason why society should try to stop him form\u2028\nliving the way he loved to do.\u2028\nThere is also the case on a published cross-cultural marriage of\u2028\ntwo male homosexuals which\u2028\ntook place in an African country\u2028\non December30, 1995.\u2028\nAlthough both men were re-\nen and women. In both the male\u2028\nand female types of homosexuality. one of the partners plays the\u2028\ndominant and active role while the\u2028\nother one plays the passive and receptive role.\u2028\nIn the course of playing these\u2028\nroles, the personate of the affected persons may change to such an\u2028\nextent that he or she behaves as if\u2028\nhe or she were the real person\u2028\nwhose role he or she is playing.\u2028\nThis means for example that in\u2028\nthe case of the male homosexual\u2028\nplaying the role of the passive recipient partners. there may be\u2028\nsuch change in his personality, as\u2028\nin the above case, that his main\u2028\ndesire may be to be married like\u2028\nany woman to whoever has been\u2028\nhis dominant homosexual partner.\u2028\nIn such a case, he will seek to have\u2028\nhis male sexual organs removed\u2028\nsurgically so that slimed appearance of female genitals can be\u2028\nconstructed.\u2028\nOur aids against Aids are in\u2028\nmaking appropriate adjustments to our African cultural\u2028\nbeliefs and practices so as to\u2028\ndeal with these kinds of the\u2028\nrealities. This will prevent the\u2028\nuse of the same cultures by\u2028\nthe AidS virus to kill the very\u2028\npeople that they are supposed\u2028\nto protect.\u2028\nHomosexuals practice anal sex,\u2028\nnamely sex through the lower end\u2028\nof the gut, with another male in\u2028\nstead of the vagina of a female.\u2028\nWe must however remember that\u2028\nthe anus, and the gut inside, are\u2028\nnot suited to the thrusting movements of the penis. Because of this\u2028\nthey get cut, torn and bruised.\u2028\nThese incomes in turn lead to infections around die anus. If the\u2028\nmale inserting his penis ejaculates\nsemen loaded with the Aids virus.\u2028\nthe injuries provide the entry\u2028\npoints for the virus to invade the\u2028\nbody.\u2028\nIn homosexuality. there are also\u2028\nrecipient male prostitutes who\u2028\nhave sexual encounters with man\u2028\nmale clients and who are there fore\u2028\nparticularly prone Lo Aids.\u2028\nThere arc also cases where\u2028\nmales demand to have anal sex\u2028\nwith prostitutes. Such a prostitutes will therefore suffer additional injuries apart from STD.\u2028\nOur aids against Aids are inconstantly remarking our\u2028\nselves that the anus and the\u2028\ngut inside are not suited to\u2028\nthe thrusting\nmovements\u2028\nof an organ\u2028\nlike the penis\u2028\nin the way\u2028\nthat the vagina is.\u2028\nWith regard\u2028\nto female homosexuals or\u2028\nlesbians, the\u2028\nquestion has\nbeen asked as to whether they\u2028\nspread Aids the way male homosexuals do. The answer is that\u2028\nthey do not nominally spreads Aids\u2028\nbecause they stimulate one another\u2019s genitals by hands or tongues.\u2028\nHowever, when they do that,\u2028\nthey leave to ensure that they do\u2028\nnot have Cuts or sores which form\u2028\nentry points for the Aids virus\u2028\nfrom the fluids of an infected\u2028\npartner.\u2028\nHomosexuals and intravenous\ndrug users have thus been the the\u2028\nmain made of spread of Aids in\u2028\nthe western world. Although there\u2028\nis a higher rate of partner change\u2028\nin male-male sex than in male-female sex, homosexuals generally\u2028\ninteract with one another sexually\u2028\nwith )it or no interaction with\u2028\nthe rest of the population.\u2028\nThis k the main reason why\u2028\nwomen in the developed countries\u2028\nhave been protected against Aids.\u2028\nHowever, with married men who\u2028\nare also homosexuals and intravenous drug users, there is an in\u2028\ncreased incidence of infection of\u2028\nwives from such bisexual\u2028\nhusbands.\u2028\nAlthough homosexuality has\u2028\nexisted in Kenya only in a small\nway. it has grown steadily with\u2028\nthe growth of sex tourism where\u2028\nby homosexuals arrange sexual\u2028\nholidays in many countries of the\u2028\nworld. These practices have thus\u2028\nfound their way to Africa, including Kenya.\u2028\nOur aids against Aids are in\u2028\nthe ways and means we have\u2028\nfor protecting the young men\u2028\nroaming international hotels\u2028\nlooking for rich tourists as\u2028\nthey are prone to becoming\u2028\nhomosexual prostitutes and\u2028\nto acquiring Aids though international prostitution and\u2028\nsex tourism.\u2028\nAn Aids Education\u2028\nProgramme, P.O.
