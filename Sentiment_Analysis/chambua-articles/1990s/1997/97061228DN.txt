{"text": "JUNE 12, 1997\n\nDelivery fraught with danger \u2028\nThe majority of babies of mothers \u2028\nwith Aids get infected during \u2028\nlabour and delivery. This is a process which involves the passing \u2028\nout of the fluid in which the baby \u2028\nhas been floating in the womb. \u2028\nThe process also involves some \u2028\nblood. These fluids may be infected with the Aids virus which Will \u2028\nthen infect some of babies during \u2028\nlabour and delivery. \u2028\nAfter delivery. some of the babies who have been infected develop Aids in the first six months \u2028\nto one year While the majority develop it later during childhood. \u2028\nBirth is the process by which \u2028\nthe baby gets out Of the mother\u2019s \u2028\nwomb. \u2028\nOur against AIDS are in \u2028\nensuring that pregnant mothers deliver their babies under \u2028\nadequate medical care, especially those mothers who are \u2028\n\u2028\nA series b Prof. Maina \u2028\nI f many babies are born at short \u2028\nintervals Of one year, the health \u2028\nand welfare of the whole family is \u2028\nbadly affected, \u2028\nAids complicates this situation \u2028\nand causes the person to be infected by several Other diseases. \u2028\nHuman milk is definitely more \u2028\neffective than any other type of \u2028\nmilk for the nutrition and protection of the baby against illness. \u2028\nHowever, breastfeeding by women who are HIV positive may \u2028\nlead to infection Of the babies. \u2028\nNormally, infants who have \u2028\nbeen breast-feeding do not suffer \u2028\nfrom infections such as diarrhoea \u2028\nto the extent as those who \u2028\nire artificially fed. \u2028\nThe babies who have been artificially fed also surfer more frequently and for longer periods \u2028\nfrom diarrhoea than those Who \u2028\nhave been breastfed. \u2028\nThis protection against diarrhoea appears to be due to sub- \u2028\nStances which are in the breast \u2028\nmilk, \u2028\nIn the first two or three years after birth, thin yellow milk called \u2028\ncolostrum seems to offer protection. In general however. it is due \u2028\nto the fact that milk is the ideal \u2028\nfor the baby \u2028\nHowever. since one Of the complications Of Aids is diarrhoea. \u2028\nboth the infected mother and baby \u2028\nWill inevitably suffer from it, \u2028\nthereby adding to the general illness of the family. \u2028\nOur aids against Aids are in \u2028\nknowing that breastfeeding by a \u2028\nmother with Aids may infect the \u2028\nbaby and that it is necessary to \u2028\nseek medical advice. \u2028\nAids Education \u2028\nAn \u2028\nProgramme, P.O.
