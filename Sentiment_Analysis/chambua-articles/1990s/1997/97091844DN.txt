{"text": "SEPTEMBER 18, 1997\nNew Aids drug\n'being tested'\nBy GICHIJRU NJIHIA\u2028\nA team of Kenyan doctors claim\u2028\nto have discovered a new drug for\u2028\nthe management of HIV/Aids,\u2028\nThe team, composed of prominent physicians, immunologists.\u2028\ndermatologists and virologists,\u2028\nsaid they had reported dramatic improvement in HIV/Aids patients treated with the drug code-\u2028\nnamed Cheetan.\u2028\nAmong the team was the late\u2028\nProf Hillary Ojiambo. Behind the\u2028\nresearch is Dr Joseph Chege who\u2028\nhas researched on African herbal\u2028\nmedicine and the prevalence of\u2028\nhypertensive retinopathy.\u2028\nA patent application for the\u2028\ndrug has been filed with the World\u2028\nintellectual Property Organisation.\u2028\nThe compound is being applied\u2028\nas a second user. It has previously\u2028\nbeen used for the treatment of\u2028\nother retroviral diseases and complications from senility such as\u2028\nthe thickening of the arteries, cataracts, kidney failure, and stroke.\u2028\nTwo of the investigators pre\u2028\nsent data on 13 patients treated\nwith Cheetan for one month in the\u2028\nlatest issue of the East African\u2028\nMedical Journal\u2028\nThe drug is administered orally\u2028\nat a 3mg/kg of body weight dose\u2028\nthree times a day. Weight, T-cell\u2028\ncount (CD4s), arid hemoglobin\u2028\nwere monitored before and after\u2028\nthe administration of the drug.\u2028\nin addition, polymerase chain\u2028\nreaction (PCR) and HIV culture\u2028\nwere performed in two patients.\u2028\nFrom the results, all except one\u2028\ndiabetic patient gained weight.\u2028\nThe average weight gain over one\u2028\nmonth was four kilogrammes. All\u2028\nthe patients who completed the\u2028\ndose also showed a marked in\u2028\ncrease in their CD4 counts.\u2028\nAfter a month of treatment with\u2028\nCheetan, patients had an average\u2028\nincrease of (58 cells per cubic\u2028\nmillimetre in their CD4 counts.\u2028\nAccording lo 1996 figures from\u2028\nthe Johns Hopkins University, a\u2028\ncocktail of a protease inhibitor, a\u2028\nreverse transcriptase inhibitor,\u2028\nand a nucleoside analogue in\u2028\ncreases the CD4 count by an aver-age of lO0 cells at an annual cost\u2028\nof S 125,000.\u2028\nWithout treatment, the natural\u2028\ndecrease in CD4 count is 30-50\u2028\nper year. This means that treatment with Cheetan can restore\u2028\nCD4 counts back to normal if given over a sufficient period.\u2028\nIn the two patients on whom\u2028\nPCR and HIV culture were performed, there was reduction in viral loads to levels that were undetectable by both methods.\u2028\nThe only side effect reported \u00a1n\u2028\npatients on Cheetan was nausea\u2028\nand vomiting in 20 per cent of the\u2028\npatients. This, however, only lasts\u2028\nabout 30 minutes after initial ingestion of the drug.\u2028\nApart from its use in diabetes\u2028\nmellitus. the compound 3-amino-\u2028\n4-hydroxybenzoic acid has also\u2028\nbeen used as an active ingredient\u2028\nin vaginal Contraceptive formulations.\u2028\nThe studies are only preliminary and a broader study is under\u2028\nway. The proposal! is already with\u2028\nthe director of medical services."}
