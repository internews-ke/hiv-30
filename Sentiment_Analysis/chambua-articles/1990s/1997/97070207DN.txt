{"text": "Encourage abstinence\nIt is good that Capital FM is concerned\nabout the Aids scourge. Its\n\"red ribbon\" campaign was quite\n\" 'interesting. However, the station\n, .should inform its listeners that using condoms is like throwing a die:\nand hoping not to get an odd\nnumber.\nCapital FM should tell listeners\nthat the HIV virus is much smaller\nthan a pore on a condom. ,\nWhen one has sex, there is a lot\nof contact. Unless one wears a full\nbody condom, complete with a\nheadgear, there is no protection\nagainst STDs or even Aids.\nWould it hurt if Capital FM ran\na vigorous abstinence or \"true\nlove waits\" campaign?\nDavid F.
