{"text": "Medics worry over gay prostitution\nBy OSCAR OBONYO\nMonte's entry to a Nairobi twilight\nspot is greeted with clicks\nand jeers from female patrons,\nmostly prostitutes. He is a threat\nto their business.\n\"Monte usipochunga, siku\nmoja utapata mimba! (Monte,\nyou better watch out or else you\nwill end up pregnant!),\" one of\nthe girls sarcastically remarked in\nKiswahili causing deafening\nlaughter in the club ..\nMonte, who won't give his real\nname, is a homosexual. His unpopularity\nwith female commercial\nsex workers stems from the\nfact that he competes with them\nfor male clients.\n\"He is real nuisance!\" laments\n\"Madiaba\" (real name withheld)\na regular hooker at M-Gee, the pet\nname of this night club downtown\nNairobi. \"Imagine yeye hujiteteapia\nkwa wanaume (He even\nmakes advances at fellow men),\"\ncomments the podgy girl, also\nnicknamed Big Mama by M-Gee\npatrons.\nMonte is not alone. He is one of\nthe youths engaged in homosexuality,\na peculiar trait where one is\nsexually attracted only to people\nof the same sex as oneself.\nAnd as more men take this\ntrend, medics are sounding an\nalarm that the move is akin to\njumping from the frying pan into\nthe fire. \"The act causes bruises and\ncreates open skins thereby exposing\nthose involved to Aids infection,\"\nsays Dr Godfrey Baltazar,\nan epidemiologist at the\nNational Aids and Sexually\nTransmitted Diseases Control\nProgramme (Nascop).\n\"As a passageway, the anus is\nmeant for things to come out of it\nand not for things to be fixed into\nit,\" Dr Baltazar quips. And intercourse,\nhe explains, ruptures\nsphincters and the glans.\nThis kind of contact, Baltazar\nwarns, is the surest way of contracting\nAids from an infected\npartner given that the HIV virus is\nlargely spread through blood\ncontact.\nThis danger notwithstanding, a\ngrowing number of young people\nconsider homosexuality a romantic\nand high class trait. \"You are\nconsidered a villager if you cannot\nengage in it,\" says George (not\nreal name) an employee of Kenyatta\nNational Hospital.\nGeorge narrates about a former\ngirl friend who went to the United\nStates for studies and who on returning\nasked him to make love to\nher through the anus. \"I was perplexed\nand asked her what the hell\nhad become of her!\"\nThe girl was equally perplexed\nthat an educated man like him\nwould find anything wrong with\nsuch a \"common\" and \"acceptable\"\nway of expressing love. According to A Global Report:\nAids In The World, a Harvard\n1992 University publication,\nhomosexual men in the US were\nthe first focus of attention when\nthe HIV/Aids pandemic began\nand their communities were the\nfirst to develop prevention programmes.\nThe publication notes\nthat while the identified American\ngay man has over the. years learnt\nto practice safe intercourse, his\nAfrican counterpart is still lost in a\nfad of aping alien trends.\nInterviews carried out by IRIS\nin Nairobi unearth shocking revelations.\n\"We offer ourselves to\nfellow men because of poverty. It\nis safer to than pick-pocketing\nwhere one risks getting lynched,\"\nsays Peter (second name\nwithheld).\nThe perpetrators have even\nmore startling reasons, \"Female\nprostitutes are too expensive yet\none has to fulfill some of these\nurges,\" a homosexual who preys\non revellers in a popular discotheque\non Koinange street told\nthis writer.\n\"Men are cheap. Sometimes\nyou only have to buy a drink, a\ncigarette and give him some little\nmoney.\" Some of the men say\nthey prefer fellow men because\nfemale prostitutes are HIV carriers.\n\"This is a very wrong assumption!\nBoth male and female prostitutes are in the HIV high risk\ngroups,\" says Dr David Ndirangu\nof the Obstetrics and Gynaecology\nclinic, at the Kenyatta\nNational Hospital.\nAlthough medics concede that\nanal contact is contributing to escalating\nAids cases, no known\nstudies have been carried out on\nhomosexuality and Aids in\nKenya.\n\"It is not even easy to keep records\nsince this is a new phenomenon\nhere, and many homosexuals\nare operating under cover,\" says\nDr Baltazar.\nDr Ndirangu adds that a physician's\nprimary concern is the patient's\nhealth condition. \"It is not\npractical to bother about the\nsource of infection since its humiliates\nthe patients and doesn't\nreverse the situation anyway.\"\nAccording to a Nairobi psychologist,\nDr Maxwell Okonji,\nhomosexuals are victims of psychological\ndisorders and hormonal\ndiseases. Okonji notes that such\ndisorders have a direct bearing to\none's sexual orientation as he/she\ngrows up.\n\"There are people who feel as\nif they are in the wrong body and\ncrave to change their sexes. This\nkind of obsession begets peculiar\ntendencies among victims, \" notes\nthe psychologist.\nDr Okonji says anal intercourse\naffects all across the social spectrum \u2013 the poor and the rich. Currently, former Zimbabwe president Canaan Banana, is faced with\ncharges of homosexual rape.\nBoth Dr Baltazar and Dr Ndirangu believe that it is imperative to discourage anal contact to curb the spread of Aids.\nOne way of treating it, Dr Okonji says, is to show gay men photographs of nude men fondling and while they are engrossed in them, you subject them to a mild electric shock.\n- An Iris Feature\n\nThe homosexual prostitutes also make advances to men clients to the chagrin of their female counterparts .."}
