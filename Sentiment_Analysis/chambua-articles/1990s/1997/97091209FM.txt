{"text": "Rib-tickling comedies\nwith sombre message\nBy NATION CORRESPONDENT\nSince the advent of Aids in the\nmid-1980s, Kenyans have been\nbombarded with information on\nthe malady from all quarters,\nalerting them on the different\nways in which it is transmitted.\nThere is no denying that this\nhas been effective, with 80 percent\nof the population being aware\nof Aids/HIV.\nYet, the campaign in combating\nAids is not over: People continue\nto die from the Aids-related\nailments, Nyanza Province being\none of the worst hit.\nApparently, people have refused;\nto take charge of their lives\nat a personal level and have stuck\nto their wayward behaviour, even\nin the full knowledge that they're\nrisking their lives.\nIt is with this in mind that Artnet\nWaves Communications, in\nconjunction with Belgium Administration\nfor Development Cooperation\n(B.A.D.C), plan to stage\nan extravaganza at Kisumu Sports\nGround next weekend, in which a\nnew concept in fighting Aids/HIV\nwill be launched.\nKisumu will rock to the' vibrant\nsounds of Okatch Biggy's Super\nHekaheka Band, Ochieng Kabaselleh,\nD.O. Misiani, George Ramogi\nand Them Mushrooms,\namong others; while comedians\nNyengese and Darubini and many\nothers will present rib-tickling\ncomedies.\nThe music extravaganza will be\nthe climax of the two-day fete,\nwhich starts on Friday with plays\nfocusing on Aids.\nThe new campaign is called Jisimamie\n(Stand Up Against\nAIDS), and calls on people to\nchange their errant sexual\nbehaviour and be responsible for\ntheir own lives ..\nThe programmes include\nYouth Drama competitions in\nwhich messages on Aids will be\ntransmitted.\nThis is a follow-up to the\nnational Aids Day' drama festival,\nwhich Artnet organised last year\nat the Kenya Polytechnic in conjunction\nwith Family Health International.\nIt attracted 60 groups\nfrom all over the country.\nJisimamie extravaganza has a\nnumber of objectives chief,\namong them to sustain a high level of HIV/Aids awareness among\nthe youth and the general public;\nand to support national efforts in\nAids awareness campaign.\nIt calls on people to accept that\nAids is a reality and to remember\nthose who have died of Aids.\nSince its inception in 1987, the\nNational Aids Control\nProgramme, (NASCOP) in collaboration\nwith the NGO sector\nand private organisations, has carried\nout different activities to increase\nawareness in the province.\nToday, everybody has heard of\nAids and half of the people in\nNyanza have a close relative,\nneighbour or friend who is suffering\nfrom Aids, or has already died.\nAttitudes also have shifted;\nfrom rejection and stigmatisation\nto overt discrimination, people are\nmore tolerant and handle victims\nwith care and understanding.\nThis is a major achievement but\npeople are yet to change their\nbehaviour though condom use has\nincreased.\nArguably, what has contributed\nto the spread of Aids in Nyanza\nare the age-old traditional practices\nsuch as wife-inheritance, that\ndemand that if a man dies his wife\nshould be inherited by his younger\nbrother. This jeopardises the future\nof both man and woman, especially\nif the deceased had contracted\nAids.\nExperts say men's attitudes\nhave changed and after drinking\nsprees retreat to their homes\nalone, unlike in the past when they\nwould disappear into brothels after\npainting the town red.\nEven the power of theatre also'\nneeds to be re-assessed. Besides\nsynthesising complicated terms\ninto simple and ordinary terminologies\nthat people can easily understand,\nit has the potential of being\nabused or misused, especially\nwhen people tend to enjoy drama\nand the good music that accompanies\nit more.\nDrama is meant for enjoyment,\nbut if it tends to be more titillating\nwith every episode, there is the\nrisk of making the play laughable,\nand the aesthetic value of the play\nis lost.\nIf people get hooked on the\ngood vibes and the gyrations of\nthe nearly-naked dancers, there is\nthe fear that they will get the\nwrong message."}
