{"text": "Tanzania reaps in bid\nagainst malnutrition\nAlthough Tanzania is one of the\npoorest countries in the world it\nhas achieved a dramatic improvement in alleviating malnutrition amongst its children, according to\nUnicef's annual' report to be released today.\nThe 1998 State of the World's Children's report,\nWhich concentrates on the issue of\nmalnutrition amongst children in\nthe world today, stresses that\n\"while economic growth must be understood as a frequent contributor\nto nutrition improvement it is\nnot a necessary condition for it.\"\nUnicef says that Tanzania, in\nparticular, has achieved \"widespread\nnutrition improvement\nwithout significant overall economic growth.\"\nAt the same time malnutrition\nrates in' most other sub-Saharan\nAfrican countries, including\nKenya, have risen.\nThe reason for the dramatic improvement\nin the levels of nutrition\nin large areas of Tanzania has\nbeen attributed to Unicef's own\nChild Survival and Development\nProgramme which began in only\nFive districts in the Iringa region in\nthe early 1980sbut which has now\nreached more than half of the entire\nnational population.\nUnicef's strategy is known as\nthe \"Triple A\" approach by\nwhich nutrition. is improved\nthrough first assessing a problem,\nthen analyzing its causes and finaly taking action based on the outcome of\nthis analysis..\n\"The result was the virtual disappearance of\nsevere malnutrition\nand striking reduction in mild and\nmoderate malnutrition,\" the report\nsays..\n\u2022'The lives of thousands of children were\nsaved. Of crucial importance\nwas the' Government's\ncontinued commitment to polices\nworked out with the full participation of communities and families,\"\nit adds.\nA critical factor in the success\nof the programme, according to\nUnicef, was regular monitoring of\nchildren's weight and growth\nwhich involved the whole community.\nChildren who were under\u00b7\nweight became the subject of debate amongst villagers, which led\ngradually to a greater understanding of the cases of malnutrition and measures which could be taken to prevent it in future. The report. However stresses that the Tanzanian programme did not increase the production of availability of basic food. \nCommunities\nThe findings show that while\nfood is essential for good nutrition,\nthe overall lack of food at the\nhousehold level was not the major\ncause of malnutrition in young\nchildren.\"\u00b7.\u00b7\n\"Less tangible; but singularly\nImportant was the transformation\nthat many communities' Underwent,\"\nUnicef says..\n\"From passively enduring economic deline and marginalisation  villagers became active participants for change, formulating and carrying out policies that led to better lives for their children and themselves.\nHowever, the project did involve donor support for building local health facilities, improving clean water supplies and promoting household hygiene.\n\nNevertheless,' the statistics show the success of the project which is now said to be self-sustaining.\nModerate malnutrition has fallen from 33 per cent in\n1992 to 22 per cent in 1995 and\nsevere malnutrition is down from\n3.3 per cent to 0.4 per cent.\nUnicef says that at present malnutrition is. implicated in more\nthan half of all child deaths\n\nworldwide, more than 200 children\nsuffer from malnutrition and\nan estimated226 million children\nsuffer stunted growth as a result\nof malnutrition.\nThe report adds that malnutrition\ngoes far beyond child survival\nand maternal morbidity and\nmortality.\n\"Malnourished children unlike\ntheir well-nourished peers, not\nonly have lifetime disabilities and\nweakened immune systems but\nthey also lack the capacity for\nlearning...In young children malnutrition\ndulls motivation and curiosity\nreduces play and explore activities.'\nalso stresses the vital\nImportance of adequate vitamin\nconsumption .as well as proper\nsanitary conditions in its report.\nOf particular importance is the\npower of Vitamin A which is\nfound in such foods as eggs, butter,\nwhole milk and liver.\nStudies show that deaths from\ndiarrhea can be reduced by 35 to\n40 per cent if children are given\nVitamin A supplements. Other research\nshows that Vitamin A\ncould halve the number of deaths\namong children from measles.\nMoreover, while research on\nthe subject is still incomplete,\nUnicef says it is now believed that\nsufficient Vitamin A intake may\neven be effective in reducing the\nspread of HIV/Aids in countries\nwhere malnutrition is common.\nThis follows a study of HIV infected\nwomen in Malawi which\nconcluded that Vitamin A deficient\nwomen were four-and-a half times\nmore likely to pass the\nvirus onto their children than\nthose with adequate Vitamin A\nlevels in their blood.\nUnicef says that \"many simple\nmeasure are already saving and\nimproving lives.\" It gives as an\nexample the fact that 60 per cent\nof all salt in the world is now iodised,\nwhich has helped dramatically\nreduce the level of mental\nretardation. But the report says\nthat much more needs to be done\nto address the problem.\n\"The persistence of malnutrition\nhas profound and frightening\nimplications for children society\nand mankind says Unicef executive director, Ms Carol Bellamy.\n\nAt a time when malnutrition rates in Kenya and other sub-Saharan\nMrican countries are rising, Tanzania has achieved \"widespread\nnutrition improvement without a significant overall economic\ngrowth,\" writes PAUL REDFERN, NATIONCorrespondent, London.\nA Somali child is immunised arid given a Vitamin A capsule:\nProtecting children's health is a vital corollary to goodnutrition."}
