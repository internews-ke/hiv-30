{"text": "Condom not\nthe solution\nI am appealing to the advertisers\nof Trust Condom to mention its\nshortcomings as well. These\nshould be written out in the same\nsize of letters as those calling for\nits use. For example they should\ninclude the words that the \"condom\nis not absolutely safe and one\ncould contract the HIV virus even\nif using it.\"\nIf they do not want to do this,\nthen they should not advertise at\nall. On the other hand, the advertisement\ncould read, \"Let's talk.\nabout chastity until we get\nmarried!\" Why not! J.F. Apiyo,\nNairobi."}
