{"text": "MAY 22,1997\nYouth prostitution worsens spread\nOne of the most tragic aspects of\u2028\nthe spread of Aids in Africa is the\u2028\nway it is affecting adolescents and\u2028\nyoung adults. It is a matter of great\u2028\nconcern that today, mature men\u2028\nare having sex with younger\u2028\nwomen due to the belief that the\u2028\nyoung girls are free of the Aids virus. This means that more young\u2028\nwomen get infected by HIV than\u2028\ntheir male counterparts.\u2028\nThe increase in child prostitution is thus largely due to the fear\u2028\nused by the rapid spread of Aids\u2028\nan sexually transmitted\u2028\ndiseases in the adult population.\u2028\nThis is what has led to the increase in youth prostitution, especially in those countries which\u2028\nhave large numbers of tourists\u2028\nand/or foreign soldiers.\u2028\n\u2022 Unemployment and poverty are\u2028\n.certainly some of the social condition\u2028\nLions .which bring about juvenile\ndelinquency and youth prostitution. .\u2028\nThis trend is likely to grow in\u2028\ndeveloping countries where some\u2028\n70-90 per cent of adolescents terminate their education at the end\u2028\nof primary school.\u2028\nOur aids against Aids are in\u2028\nknowing that youth prostitution is a growing trade and\u2028\nthat it is increasing the\u2028\nspread of Aids in the general\u2028\npublic.\u2028\n...\u2028\nThese girls start sexual activities\u2028\nat an early age and are often not\u2028\naware that they are practising\u2028\nprostitution.\u2028\nThey \u00a1live in cramped conditions where they see their mothers, aunts and other relatives enganging in sex and soon discover\u2028\nthat it is a way of earning a living.\nThe mothers themselves go to\u2028\nthe streets to look for men. Furthermore, in order to maximise\u2028\ntheir .earnings they have se with\u2028\nmany men. . .\u2028\nPromiscuity, therefore, becomes a way of life at an early\u2028\nage. This in turn is likely to become a major venue for the spread\u2028\nof Aids and other sexually transmitted diseases.\u2028\nThe men who have sex with\u2028\nthese young prostitutes will continue to return to their wives and\u2028\nthereby expose them to Aids and\u2028\nother sexually transmitted\u2028\ndiseases. ,\u2028\nIt is estimated that as many as\u2028\n40,000 of the prostitutes in one\u2028\ndeveloping country are under the\u2028\nage of 14 years with most of them\u2028\ncoming from poor homes and arc\u2028\nuneducated. .\u2028\nWe have to pay special attention to adolescents and young\u2028\nadults. In particular, we have to\neducate young persons, especially\u2028\ngirls, on the modes of transmission of HIV so as to demystify this\u2028\ndisease.\u2028\nWe have to enable the youth.\u2028\nespecially girls, to articulate all\u2028\nthe risks of transmission and make\u2028\nwell informed decisions to avoid\u2028\nrisks, exposing themselves to HIV\u2028\nrisks, bearing in mind that traditionally sexual relationships have\u2028\nbeen dominated by the male.\u2028\nas *\u2028\nOur  against Aids are in\u2028\npaying much more attention\u2028\nto this population of young\u2028\nprostitutes. -\u2028\nWe must also remember that the\u2028\nsugar daddy phenomenon has\u2028\nbeen growing . in secondary\u2028\nschools, where girls get school\u2028\nfees and clothes from older men in\u2028\nreturn for sex.\nThe unfortunate girl who gets\u2028\npregnant is expelled- from school\u2028\nand loses both her educational opportunity and future employment.\u2028\nSome of- these sugar daddies\u2028\nhave chains, of businesses and\u2028\nin various parts of the\u2028\ncountry. . :\u2028\nAs they visit these places, \u2028\ntake with them, or they find waiting them, chains of young girl\u2028\nprostitutes drawn from schools.\u2028\nOur aids against Aids are in\u2028\ngetting parents-teachers associations in schools to discuss these issues and undertake serious counselling\u2028\nwork for adolescents in\u2028\nschools. -\u2028\nO An Aids Education\u2028\nProgramme, P.O.
