{"text": "SA scientists claim\nAids breakthrough\nBy CHRIS ERASMUS\nNATION Correspondent\nCAPE TOWN, Wednesday\nA group of South African scientists\nsay they have come up with\nthe first low-cost treatment for\nAids which not only kills the\nHuman Immunodeficiency Virus\n(HIV) that causes the killer disease,\nbut also increases the numbers\nof immune system cells destroyed\nby HIV.\nClinical trials of the anti-retro\nvirus formula, patented as Virodene\nP058, have promised a cheap\nand effective treatment even for\npatients with advanced Aids\nsymptoms which kills HIV anywhere\nin the body and returns\nthem to health while vastly increasing\ntheir life expectancy.\nAlthough the studies must still\nrun at least six more months to see\nwhether the dozen Aids patients\nwho have received the breakthrough\ntreatment relapse, there is\na real prospect that the discovery\nof Virodene P058 has heralded the\nlong sought for cure for Aids.\nThe SA Press Association reports\nthat the team which made\nthe breakthrough received a\nstanding ovation from President\nNelson Mandela's full Cabinet\nearlier today after making a presentation\non their findings in support\nof an appeal for more research\nfunding.\nSumming up their findings so\nfar, the SA scientists said their\nshort term prognosis is that Virodene - a synthesised biochemical\nsubstance which is similar to a\nmetabolic waste product of the\nhuman body and whose composition\nis still secret - kills HIV in the\nbody and allows people infected\nwith it to live long and normal\nlives after a six to eight week\ntreatment programme.\nOne of the most dramatic trial\nresults has been the recovery of\nfull-blown Aids sufferers on the\nbrink of death after just a few\ntreatments with the drug.\nIn these cases, the patients have\nreverted to HIV-positive status\nand are no longer as susceptible to\nthe opportunist diseases which\nkill Aids sufferers.\nA major factor in Virodene's\nfavour is its relatively low cost,\nputting Aids treatments within\nreach of developing nation patients\nand health systems for the\nfirst time.\nCurrent multi-drug treatments\ncost about $30,000 for an 18-\nmonth course, or $1,667 a month,\ncompared with Virodene's likely\nretail cost of $17.50 to $35 a\nmonth over just six to eight\nweeks.\nAnother apparent advantage of\nthe new treatment is that Virodene\ninduces only minor side effects,\ncompared to the extreme toxicity\nof current multi-drug treatment\nregimes. Prof Du Plessis says the\nminimal side effects caused by\nVirodene - nausea and poor digestion\n- have been eliminated."}
