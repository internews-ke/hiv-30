{"text": "JUNE 5, 1997\n\nCare treatment of HIV, Aids patients\u2028\nAs long as there is no cure for\nAids, one of the most important\nlines of dealing with the epidemic\nis through an effective Aids education.\nAwareness has so far been\ncreated on the activities that increase\nrisk and transmission.\nHowever, it is now necessary to\nbe much more effective in promoting\nprevention of STDs and\nAids through structured education\nwhich the people can internalise.\nThis is necessary because, in\nspite of the awareness, the expected\nand effective behaviour change\nin sexual lifestyle has not taken\nplace.\nThere are still many people\nwho do not understand that it is\nnecessary to be more careful than\nthey have been regarding their\nsexual activities, especially the\npersons with whom they have sex.\nEffective Aids education is expected\nto intensify the effort of\ngiving factual information which\nwill help people to make informed\ndecisions about their sexual activities\nand the circumstances under\nwhich one is at risk of being infected\nand infecting other people.\nThrough effective Aids education,\nit is possible to continually\nremind people that there is nothing\nthat can be used to kill the\nAids virus or cure the disease.\nPeople who are living without\nthe virus and the disease have\nmanaged to do so mainly because\nof their sexual lifestyles by which\nthey avoid exposing themselves to\nsexual partners who have the virus,\nwith or without the disease.\nOur aids against Aids are in\nbeing willing and be able to\nmake informed decisions regarding\nthe likelihood of being\ninfected if we have sex\nwith someone whose sexual\nactivities we do not know.\nThe whole population has to be\nreached with effective Aids education\ncontaining a clear message\nthat Aids is a real threat to their\nsurvival.\nThis approach can be made effective\nbecause, on the whole,\ncommunities are aware of their\nneed to survive. The people need\nto understand the necessity of promotion\nof sexual health and prevention of Aids which combines\nwith the other killer diseases to\nthreaten survival.\nPeople must be enabled to understand\nthat their survival against\nAids depends on changing their\nsexual lifestyles. Those who are\ninfected also need to be educated\nso that they avoid infecting others.\nThose with full blown Aids are\neducated on how to manage and\nlive with the disease.\nIt is vital to treat those with the\nvirus or the disease with all the\nknowledge and health care at our\ndisposal.\nCreation of confidence in the\npatient with HIV is necessary in\norder to remove the sense of despair\nand social rejection.\nIt is also vital to improve the\nunderstanding of the patient regarding\nthe symptoms to expect as\nmanifestations or complications\nof the disease.\nThis will also enable the patient\nto comply with other forms of\ntreatment and improve the quality\nof life (adding life to the person's\ndays) as well as longevity.\nOur aids against AIDS are in\ntreating the disease as Ii public\nhealth crisis which is a\nreal threat to survival and\navoiding any activities which\nthreaten our survival.\nThere are measures which persons\nwho are at risk of transmission of\nHIV must take such as avoiding\nexchange of body fluids, especially\nsemen, during sexual activities.\nThose who are sexually active\nmust use whatever method is culturally\nand religiously acceptable\nto avoid a change of fluids. They\nmust also reduce the number of\nsexual partners. Drug users must\navoid exchanging needles.\nRelatives and health workers\nare also educated on how to develop favorable attitudes towards\npeople with HIV/Aids so as cope\nwith them.\nThey need new knowledge and\nskills on the disease and on their\nown safety against infection.\nOpportunistic infection such as\ndiarrhea, pneumonia and tuberculosis\nhave to be dealt with when\n\nthese occur.\nIn this regard, it is important to\nensure that persons with HIV are\nnot exposed to people suffering\nfrom these other infections because\nof their lowered immunity.\nFurthermore, when HIV positive\npatients get these other infections\nthey need to be treated\nquickly and effectively to avoid\nprogressing to full blown Aids.\nIn general, and because of the\nopportunistic diseases, people\nwho are HIV positive are prescribed\nmore drugs against infections\nby bacteria and fungi, including\ndiarrhea, than HIV negative\npatients.\nThis is what makes Aids such\nan expensive disease to deal with.\nTile use of drugs which reduce the\nvirus load and reduce the severity\nof the symptoms helps to add life\nto the patient's days.\nIn all these forms of treatment,\nit is vital to give the patient high\nprotein and calorie foods with vitamins\nbecause they \u201chelp in maintaining\nthe production of the immune\nsubstances (antibodies)\nwhich are themselves proteins.\n\nOur aids against Aids are in\navoiding infecting other\npeople, or getting infected\nwith the Aids virus, and in appreciating\nthe risk of spread\nof the disease in the general\npopulation . and undertaking\neffective Aids education."}
