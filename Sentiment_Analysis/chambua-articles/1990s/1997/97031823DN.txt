{"text": "Aids appears to stabilise in EU states\nBy EDUARDO ORTEGA\nin BRUSSELS\nThe incidence of Acquired Immune\nDeficiency Syndrome\n(Aids) appears to have stabilised\nfor the first time within the European\nUnion (EU), except in Spain,\nItaly and Portugal, the European\nCommission has announced.\nDuring the first nine months of\n1996, 17,778 new cases were diagnosed,\nwhile 134 transnational\nAids prevention projects received\nthe support of the European Union\nin the 1994-1995 period.\nAccording to a report adopted\nby the European Commission (the\nEU executive body) on the\n\"Europe against Aids\" plan put\ninto action in 1994-95, the incidence\nof the disease appears to\nhave centered a more contained\nphase. However, the general stability\nis marked by profound differences\nbetween the 15 EU members, for\nthe epidemic has not retreated in\nSpain, Italy and Portugal, where\nthe incidence of Aids is especially\nhigh in association with intravenous\ndrug abuse.\nIn the 1993-1995 period, the\naccumulated total of cases in\nSpain reached 39,170, in Italy\n33,70 I and in Portugal 3,341\ncompared with 514 in Ireland, 105\nin Luxembourg and 230 in Finland,\naccording to official figures.\n\"To a certain extent, this is a\nhopeful sign even if future projections\ncannot be made and we must\nlimit ourselves to the data available,\"\nsaid Nico Wegter, Commission\nrepresentative.\nThe 17,778 new Aids cases reported\nto the European Commission were recorded between\nJanuary and September 1996,\nwhich increased the total of Aids\nsufferers in the EU to 167,021\nsince the illness first struck.\nThroughout the EU ambit, the\nincidence of Aids - or the new\ncases detected each year per million\ninhabitants - does not seem be\nan increasing tendency, said\nWegter.\n\"In my opinion, we can talk of\na stabilisation in relative terms,\"\nadded Andre Stroobart, a specialist\nfrom the Belgian Epidemiological\nInstitute.\n\"In the declared Aids cases, the tendency would indicate that this\nis so, but we do not yet know if in\nreality this is true or if it is due to\nnew drugs which act on the HIV\ninfected cells,\" he added.\nHe explained that while in the\nmajority of countries there are official\nregisters for the diagnosed\nAids cases, the same is not true of\nHIV positive people, \"which\nmakes it very difficult to compare\none country with another.\"\nHe added that in a recent conference\non epidemiology in Paris,\n,the French doctors had also said\nthe problem of HIV positive\npeople not. submitting themselves to laboratory tests \"impeded\ncomparative statistics\" from being\ndrawn up.\nAnd while the epidemic was\noriginally found among homosexual\nor bisexual men, since 1990,\nintravenous drug abusers have\ntaken the lead in the number of\ncases diagnosed each year in\nEurope.\nAccording to the European\nCommission report, in 1995, 43\nper cent of the new cases diagnosed\nwere linked to injecting\ndrugs, while 28 per cent were homosexual\nor bisexual men and 19 per cent from heterosexual\ncontact .\nMr Padraig Flynn, the European\nCommissioner responsible\nfor public health, said Aids sufferers\nmust be supported, condemning\nany form of discrimination\nagainst declared Aids sufferers or\nhealthy HIV carriers. ,.\nHe added that until an effective\nvaccine is developed \"the only\ntrue defence against this terrible\ndisease is prevention via information\nand education, and also. by\npromoting sexual responsibility\nand reducing the risks caused by\ndrug ac diets.\" (IPS)"}
