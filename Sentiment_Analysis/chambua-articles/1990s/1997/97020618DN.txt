{"text": "HIV's guerrilla warfare against a victim's body\nThe way in which the Aids viruses\nreproduce themselves inside the\nlymphocyte cells and make the\ngenetic material of the cells produce\nmore viruses is one of the\nmost mysterious aspects of the\ndisease.\nIn other infections, the lymphocytes\nwould respond by fighting\nthe invading viruses. But in the\ncase of Aids, the viruses not only\nneutralise the lymphocytes but\nalso make them reproduce more\nviruses. Having achieved that\nvery mysterious change, the viruses\nthen go into quiet hiding in the\nlymphocytes.\nHowever, if the person suffers\nfrom any other infection and the\nlymphocytes respond by trying to\nresist the infection, the viruses\nwill also become active and start\nattacking, making the lymphocytes\nless effective.\nThis is what happens in the tropics, where people suffer from\nmany more infections more frequently\nthan people in the developed\ncountries.\nTheir lymphocyte cells are under\nconstant harassment by frequent\ninfections, thereby making\nthem vulnerable to attack by the\nAids virus.\nThe changed viruses remain inactive\nin the immune-producing\ncells (lymphocytes) for six to\neight years in the case of Africa or\n10-12 years in the developed\ncountries.\nThis is the incubation period,\nwhen germs remain inactive in the\nbody before they cause disease.\nThere are two points to Dote\nabout these figures. Firstly, in\ncontrast to the incubation periods\nof other diseases, these periods\nduring which the Aids virus is incubating\nin the body are unusually\nlong. This is one of the mysteries of\nthe Aids virus. Unlike other diseases,\nthe HIV, namely Aids, develop\nfully. It is as if the viruses\nare taking their time to prepare\nfully for the final battle and\nvictory.\nThis long incubation period\nalso makes Aids a very dangerous\ndisease because it creates a false\nsense of security.\nThe person affected looks and\nfeels healthy. As a result, when\nthe disease does eventually set in,\nthe infected persons and their sexual\npartners are suddenly caught\nunawares as the virus is rapidly\nspread.\nThe viruses are thus spread rapidly\nto other people who may have\nsex with those who are carrying it. .\nThe second point is that, in\nAfrica, people who are infected with tbc viruses are taking a much\nshorter time to progress to the fullblown\ndisease than those in the\ndeveloped countries.\nWhen the viruses have completely\nchanged the immune-producing\ncells (lymphocytes) so that\nthey behave like the viruses themselves,\nthe time has come for the\nfinal destruction.\nOur aids against Aids are in\nknowing how the Aids virus\nstays in the body without symptoms\nand then other diseases appear. This knowledge will aid us\nin understanding the long incubation\nperiod of Aids and also\nthe reason why Aids sufferers\nsuffer and die from other diseases\nwhich are normally\ncurable.\n\nAids Education Programme.

Nairobi\n\nClaims against condoms refuted\nBy NATION Reporter\nThe Family Planning Association\nof Kenya (FPAK) and the Centres\nfor Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC) have dismissed as\nbaseless and totally unfounded\nclaims that condoms are ineffective\nanti-Aids devices.\nThe Atlanta-based CDC says\nthere continues to be misinformation\nand misunderstanding about\nthe effectiveness of condoms impacting\nnegatively on their usage.\nIn a recent statement titled\n\"Condoms and their Use in Preventing\nHIV Infection and Other\nSexually Transmitted Diseases\",\nCDC listed the three most common\nmyths about condoms as\nfollows: \nCondoms do not work because of their high failure rate to prevent contraception. Have holes/pores through which the Aids virus, HIV, can pass. Rupture easily and therefore do not give any protection.\nThe CDC said recent studies had provided evidence that condoms were \u201dhighly effective in protecting users against HIV infection when used properly for every act of intercourse\u201d\nOf some 123 discordant couples (couples where one partner is healthy while the other is HIV positive) who used condoms consistently in the studies, none of the health partners got infected the CDC added.
