{"text": "Fela Kuti's death \\exposes AIDS spread\nBy Mathew Tostevin \nLAGOS, Thursday\n\nThe death of popular Nigerian musician Fela Anikulapo-Kuti through  AIDS, disease he refused to believe in, has exposed the risk of an exploding death toll in Africa's most populous country.\n\nOther countries on the world's worst hit continent are making serious efforts to stop the disease spreading.\n\nBut in Nigeria the attitude has it been one of at best' complacency and at worst denial.\n\nDoctors now hope that Fela's death will make Nigerians take the danger seriously.\n\n\"AIDS is spreading rapidly in our country ...and when you start dying you will get the ,shock of your lives. Don't leave this place sniggering about Fela,\" the singer\u2019s doctor brother, Professor Olikoye Ransome-Kuti, told a gathering of his fans. \n\nAnikulapo-Kuti, who created the Afro-beat sound and helped popularise African music around the globe, was 58 when he died.\n\nHe refused to acknowledge the existence of AIDS, which many of his fans called a \u201cwhite man sickness\" and reputedly slept with hundreds of women, refusing to use condoms.\n\nNow he has become the best-known Nigerian to die of the disease.\n\nOfficial figures on how many of Nigeria's more than 100 million people are infected with the HIV virus which causes AIDS are hard to come by. Based on small samples, their accuracy is doubtful and they are usually out of date.\n\"The last figure we had in 1996 for HIV infection was 3.8 per cent of the sexually active population, that may be half or a quarter of the real level, \".haemotologist Professor Ibironke Akinsete told Reuters.\n'These days we have an average of 10.to 20 patients a week in one hospital. Two years ago there were maybe two patients a week,\" she added.\n\nIn Africa, where homosexuality is frequently considered repulsive, AIDS is spread mostly through heterosexual contact.\n\nHushed silence among hundreds of fans, including many very frightened former girlfriends, greeted news of Fela's diagnosis. By the next day the news, and the fear, had crept onto the streets and into the workplace.\n\n\"I will definitely get an AIDS test now, this disease has really arrived here,\" said airport protocol officer Mr Simon Okon.\n\nFear and crisis are not new to military-ruled Nigeria, which has been in political and economic turmoil since the army annulled the 1993 election.\n\nDespite its crude oil output, Nigeria's economy is deep in recession. Millions live below the poverty line in a struggle for daily life that leaves little time to think about AIDS, or even more visible killer diseases like malaria and diarrhoea.\n\nThe government has other priorities, and doctors say that only $300,000 per year is budgeted for\nAIDS prevention. \n\nA senior naval officer suggested last year that infected women be sent to spread HIV among soldiers in neighbouring Cameroon, with which Nigeria has a border dispute.\n\n\"My information is that the government's efforts to prevent AIDS are abysmally inadequate, believe the government is letting the people down, \" said Ransome- Kuti.\n\nDoctors hope that the shock of  Fela's death will make Nigerians change their behavior. Many doctors hope that Fela\u2019s death will serve as a new lever against AIDS as the death yet another great African musician, Franco Luambo Luanzo Makiadi in 1989 brought home the reality of the disease to the former Zaire.\n(Reuter)"}
