{"text": "After years of solitude, I'm desperate for someone to love\nDear Amani,\nI am a lonely 32-year-old man. I haven't been in love at all, nor have I made love since my teenage years, when I thought and felt a \"real\" man has to have sex.\nHowever, now I feel emotionally empty and desperate for someone to love.\n\nDear Lonely,\nToday, many young people are lonely and desperate to find someone to love. Many are scared to be hurt; some are scared of relationships because many people feel relationships should always end up in bed. This, however, is not true.\nOne needs to define the kind of relationship they want. In this day and age, one needs to be careful about who they sleep with. I am talking about HIV/Aids. \nSome people say to themselves, I can decide to sleep with her or him - it would not 'mean a thing. But it does. It could mean a difference between life and death. You don't mention why you haven't had sex in a while, but I guess this could be the reason: Fear of contracting HIV/Aids could lead one to avoid relationships. I am not saying that you should engage in sex. But you can have a satisfying and fulfilling relationship without sex, if you concentrate on knowing the person.\nIf you have never been in a relationship, you never know what to expect.\nThe lonely act of reaching out to another person can end up in a complicated and hurtful relationship.\nYou could get HIV or make her pregnant. You may just want someone to talk to, or go to the movies or theatre with, and not' a genital relationship. If you begin a relationship out of loneliness or -desperation, you many end up getting married to the wrong person for the wrong reasons.\nThis could result in an unhappy marriage when you realise that you are not in love with your wife.\nRemember, you are a valuable, lovable person who deserves to be happy. Take your time and get out and meet people and clarify your value system.\n\nThe following are short courses at Amani. \nOctober 16 - Parenting\n(8 sessions)\nThursday, 5.30pm -7.00 pm\nOctober 18 - Become your own\ntherapist (6 sessions)\nSaturday, 9.30am - 11.00am.
