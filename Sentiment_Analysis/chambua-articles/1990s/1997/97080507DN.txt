{"text": "Highlight risk in use of Pill\nOnce again population control\nagents and advocates of sex education\nin schools have come up\nwith a sessional paper (No.1\n1997) that proposes provision of\nfamily planning services to the\nyouth and Family Life Education.\nIt is timely to highlight some of\nthe risks associated with the Pill\n(one of the common and easily'\navailable family planning methods) and consequent indiscriminate\n\"safe sex\" among teenagers. o Sexually transmitted diseases\nincluding HIV/Aids. o Pelvic inflammatory disease\nwhich may lead to infertility. o Cancer of the cervix. o Ectopic pregnancy. o Abortion o Cramps and pains in the legs\nor arms, blood clots especially\nfollowing emergency surgery.\n(The risk of blood clots can start\nwithin a month of starting the\npills). o Depression\nchanges. o Migraine-type headaches. o Liver tumour; gall bladder\ndisease.\nThe pills a potent steroid drug\nthat carries serious risks. Usually\nthe family planning service providers\neither have no time to explain\nthe risk to the teenagers or\ndare not for fear of losing their\njobs and the market for the contraceptives.\nThe Community Based Distributors\nof contraceptives (CBD's)\nwho are normally used to provide\nthese services have limited\nknowledge of human physiology\nand pharmacology. They also lack\nthe relevant counselling skills,\ntherefore they are unable to explain\nthe mechanism of the pills,\ntheir contra indications and side\neffects.\nI suggest that parents and teenagers\nbe properly educated on the\nbasic facts including the risks associated\nwill pills before they are\ncoerced into taking them.\no Margaret C.W.
