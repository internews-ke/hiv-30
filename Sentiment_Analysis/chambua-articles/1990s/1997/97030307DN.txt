{"text": "Condoms can curb Aids spread\nThe people campaigning against\nthe use of contraceptives such as\ncondoms are living behind the\ntimes.\nThe spread of HIV/Aids is a\ngrave-threat that calls for serious\nprevention measures.\nSome clerics have advocated\nabstinence and fidelity as the only\nprevention against Aids. These\nmen of the cloth overlook obvious\nfacts. Abstinence is difficult to enforce\nas most people easily give in\nto temptation and could engage in\nunsafe sex. Condoms will protect\nthem against infection.\nTo prostitutes, sex is a source of\nlivelihood. Therefore, it does not\nmake sense to advocate abstinence\namong such people. The\nonly way out for them is to educate\nthem on the need to use\ncondoms every time they have intercourse.\nThe other alternative is to close\nall brothels and lodging houses\nand give these women other\nmeans of acquiring their daily\nbread.\nThis is a serious issue as even at\nthe universities, many students don't take the Aids threat seriously\ndespite a spirited awareness\ncampaign.\nMany university students still\nlead promiscuous lives after reading\nbooks, magazine and newspaper\narticles and watching TV programmes\non the HIV/Aids\nscourge.\nThe students have been to\ncountless seminars on Aids and\nhave even attended sessions with\nconfirmed HIV carriers and\npeople with full-blown Aids.\nAt the universities, the anti-\nAids campaign should involve the\ndistribution of condoms to prevent\nthe spread of the disease.\nCondoms are not 100 per cent\nsafe but combining this with other\nmethods could enhance the\nchances of preventing the spread\nof the disease.\nThose against the use of\ncondoms and who insist on abstinence\nand fidelity had better think\nagain. These methods are almost\nimpracticable for the majority of\npeople. I stand to be corrected.\nKamau Gacheru,\nKikuyu."}
