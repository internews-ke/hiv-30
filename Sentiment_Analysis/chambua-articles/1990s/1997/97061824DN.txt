{"text": "WEDNESDAY, JUNE 18. 1997\n\nWith only 126 officially recorded\u2028\n human imnmuno-deficiency virus\u2028\n (HIV) positive people in a district\u2028\n of almost half-a-million people.\u2028\n Kajiado District could be sitting\u2028\n On a time bomb.\u2028\n This conservative figure its a\u2028\n district that covers an area of more\u2028\n than 22.001) square kilometres\u2028\n with notorious towns like Masimba, Sultan Hamud. Kiserian.\u2028\n Namanga and Loitokitok, is hardly believable. The low figures are\u2028\n likely to make medical staff in the\u2028\n district complacent, leaving the\u2028\n deadly virus to spread.\u2028\n The co-ordinotor of Ihe Belgian-funded Kajiado Sexually\u2028\n Transmitted Diseases and Aids\u2028\n Programme, Mrs Eva Kiosk, believes the statistics, which have\u2028\n beets obtained from the Rujiado\u2028\n District Hospital, are misleading.\u2028\n \u201cThe hospital does not have a\u2028\n proper record-keeping system.\u2028\n This makes it difficult to know the\u2028\n exact figure of those that have\u2028\n been affected by HIV,\u201d she says.\u2028\n \u2018The first Aids case was diagnosed n the district in 1989. The\u2028\n virus carrier came from neighbouring Machakos. Today, medical officers at the district headquarters believe that those most\u2028\n affected by Aids live its towns\u2028\n along the Mombasa highway, and\u2028\n the border towns of Namanga and\u2028\n Loitokitok.\u2028\n It has been difficult to diagnose\u2028\n the disease here due to equipment\u2028\n that has fallen into disuse and an\u2028\n acute shortage of reagents. Bat all\u2028\n this is being reversed, thanks lo\u2028\n the Belgian-funded project introduced in 1995, .\u2028\n The three-year project (1995-\u2028\n 98) aims at supplementing the efforts of the Ministry of Health\u2019s\u2028\n Medium Term Plan II, whose\u2028\n main objective is to prevent the\u2028\n spread of HIV by promoting behavioural change. It also aims at diminishing the personal and socioeconomic impact of HIV. The\u2028\n project is due for review later this\u2028\n year. A pilot survey has already\u2028\n been done in some key areas.\u2028\n is funding divisional STD\nAids committees, which are\ncharged with the responsibility of\nspreading inform\u2028\n Aide committees, Which ore pairs in health centres in the discharged with the responsibility of district, so make STD diagnosis\u2028\n spreading information about von- easy.

This has al\u2028\n ready been dour and interventions\u2028\n are being \n-\u2028\n For example, the Ngong area\u2028\n has been targeted due to its importance in the livestock marketing\u2028\n sector in the district.

They are believed to be free spenders, besides\u2028\n being associated with amorous activities.\u2028\n \u201cMost bars \u00efn Ngong Division\u2028\n have condom dispensers. This is\u2028\n besides the education that is given\u2028\n by our divisional committee\u201d Ms\u2028\n Kiok says.\u2028\n Condoms are also distributed\u2028\n during workshops and seminars\u2028\n organised by the project in the\u2028\n area.\u2028\n Common diseases in the district\u2028\n include urethral discharge, vaginal\u2028\n discharge or puritus, lower abdominal pain in women and genital ulcer disease (DUD).\u2028\n Each of the right health centres\u2028\n is supplied with sufficient kits to\u2028\n treat l00 victims of each of these\u2028\n four common diseases.\u2028\n The Belgian government is increasingly becoming u key player\u2028\n in the Kenya health sector. Besides the Rujiado project, the Belgian are sponsoring a similar projeci is Kisumu District.\u2028\n Belgium is also involved iu establishing an integrated family\u2028\n planning STD/Aids control\u2028\n programme worth 80 million Belgian francs.\u2028\n Belgium is set to spend an additional 100 million francs or technical assistance during this third\u2028\n phase (1995-97) of the STD/Aids\u2028\n programme. (Att IRIS Feature)\u2028\n Low Aids figures belie\u2028\n serious infection rate\u2028\n practices survey has been undertaken in some areas and focused\u2028\n on group discussion,\u201d Ms Kiok\u2028\n says. The survey was done in two\nareas to represent urban as well as\nrural human behaviour According to Ms Kiok, the survey revealed that the level of\u2028\n awareness in final areas was very\u2028\n low. Urban people, on the other\u2028\n hand, understood how the disease\u2028\n was contracted us well as preventive measures. The question is\u2028\n whether those with she knowledge\u2028\n of the disease were willing ta\u2028\n change their behaviour to avoid\u2028\n infective.\u2028\n The widely held belief that the\u2028\n Maasai community has a liberal\u2028\n sexual lifestyle compound the situation\u2028\n Danger\u2028\n \u201cThe practice of peers sharing\u2028\n wives used to mist in the past. But\u2028\n if ii is true that it is being practised\u2028\n in some areas, then there s a real\u2028\n danger to this community,\u201d Mr\u2028\n james Supuro, the pioneering coordinator of the project, who in\u2028\n now the district\u2019s public health officer, says.\u2028\n Mr Protus ole Likama, who\nhails from Kajiados Central Division,\nsays the practice of peers\nsharing wives is an example of\nMaasai generosity. He hastens to\nadd that this occurs in extreme\ncases, and is supposed to be kept\nsecret between the woman and her\nhusband's peers.\u2028\n \u201cNobody should deny that this\u2028\n practice will hasten the spread of\u2028\n Aids in the community,\u201d he says.\u2028\n To address the issue of ignorance, which is compounded by\u2028\n massive illiteracy in the community, the project has embarked on a\u2028\n plan lo translate simple materials\u2028\non STD/Aids (from either English\u2028\n or Kiswahili the local Maasai\u2028\n language.
