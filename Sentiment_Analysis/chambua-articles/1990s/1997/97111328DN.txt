The medical \u2028\nprofession \u2028\n\u2028\nmust \u2028\neverybody continually that Aids \u2028\nis not a myth. Furthermore. \u2028\nunless the profession provides \u2028\nprofessional leadership. there is \u2028\nlikely to be a lot of confusion \u2028\nmight cause the \u2028\nsensitivities of sexuality to tum \u2028\ninto despair and tragedy. \u2028\nOur aids against Aids are in \u2028\nknowing that we are all \u2028\naffected directly or \u2028\nindirectly, by the erects of \u2028\nthose who arc infected and \u2028\nmust \u2028\ntherefore \u2028\nparticipate in prevention \u2028\nthe further spread of the \u2028\nepidemic. \u2028\nOne of the serious dilemmas in \u2028\ntrying to prevent the spread of \u2028\nAids IS that people with Aids do \u2028\nnot want the Information that \u2028\nthey. were infected to be known \u2028\nbecause of fear of loss of status \u2028\nin the society. feel ashamed and \u2028\nguilty and therefore tend to \u2028\nbecome lonely. \u2028\nThey need to be made to feel \u2028\nthat they were members or the \u2028\ncommunity or family so that \u2028\nthey did not find it too difficult \u2028\nto discuss their infection. \u2028\nOur aids against Aids are in \u2028\nmaking persons with Aids \u2028\nfeel welcome in our \u2028\ncompany go as to reduce \u2028\ntheir sense of guilt and \u2028\nrejection. \u2028\nAs everybody gets involved in \u2028\nfighting Aids, it is necessary to \u2028\nbear in mind that the medical \u2028\nprofession was expected to do \u2028\nwhat was best for the person \u2028\nmoralising and \u2028\nwithout \u2028\nmystifying 'he problem any \u2028\nfurther. \u2028\nIt is also the responsibility of \u2028\nthe doctor to keep confidential \u2028\nwhatever he/she learned about \u2028\nthe patient. \u2028\nThe dilemma Of how 10 \u2028\nhandle HIV information is \u2028\ncomplicated by the problem of \u2028\nlack of knowledge which is \u2028\nneeded in discussing sexuality \u2028\nbecause of the great secrecy \u2028\nabout' sexuality by modern \u2028\nsociety \u2028\nA series b Prof. Maina Muni \u2028\nB, OTIENO \u2028\nTyphoid, a formerly \u2028\nassociated With rural Kenya IS \u2028\nsteadily becoming a silent killer \u2028\nin major urban centres. \u2028\nTyphoid fever is now a \u2028\ncommon disease in urban centres \u2028\nlike Nairobi, and Mombasa. \u2028\nAccording to the World Health \u2028\nOrganisation, typhoid kills \u2028\napproximately 600,000 \u2028\nannually. The disease that infects \u2028\napproximately 16 million \u2028\nworldwide has a mortality rate of \u2028\nbetween 12 to 30 per cent and \u2028\ntwo to eight per cent in the \u2028\ndeveloping and developed world \u2028\nrespectively. \u2028\nTyphoid fever, according to \u2028\nProf. Gideon Okelo, the \u2028\nExecutive Director African \u2028\nAcademy of Sciences, \u2028\nboth the developing\u2014and \u2028\ndeveloped world. \u2028\nIt has been contained in \u2028\nEurope and North America. But \u2028\neven Japan, which is considered \u2028\none of the most developed \u2028\ncountries in the world is still \u2028\ngrappling with the disease. \u2028\nKisumu is well known for Its \u2028\nhigh typhoid rates due \u2028\nto use of contaminated water. \u2028\nIn Nairobi. slums like Kibera, \u2028\nMathare. Majengo am Incoming \u2028\ntyphoid-prone and the situation is \u2028\nnot expected to improve. \u2028\nAnd With the ever-increasing \u2028\npopulation. \u2028\ncoupled With \u2028\ndeclining health standards in \u2028\nmost urban centres in Africa, the \u2028\ndisease is poised to become one \u2028\nor the major killers besides Aids \u2028\nand malaria. \u2028\nThe disease is caused by \u2028\nbacteria which belongs to the \u2028\nsalmonella group With the \u2028\ncommon ones being salmonella \u2028\nand salmonella \u2028\nof \u2028\nthrough \u2028\ncontaminated food and water \u2028\nresulting from careless disposal \u2028\n'Of human waste and garbage. \u2028\nIl is also transmitted through \u2028\nthrough sexual contact, says Dr \u2028\nNazir Mizm a consultant micro- \u2028\nbiologist. \"This mode of \u2028\ntransmission is common among \u2028\nhomosexuals, she said. \u2028\nThe salmonella typhi \u2028\nwhich causes typhoid fever \u2028\nin human beings and is \u2028\nspread by infected \u2028\nthrough their stool. vomit and \u2028\u2028\nProf, Okelo warns that unless \u2028\n'he standards Of cleanliness were \u2028\nimproved, typhoid would \u2028\ncontinue to claim many lives m \u2028\nthe foreseeable future. \u2028\nGlobally, mortality \u2028\nfrom the disease has continued to \u2028\nrise With developing countries \u2028\naffected the worst. \u2028\nIn Kenya the most affected \u2028\nincludes children above \u2028\nthe age of five, adolescents md \u2028\nyoung adults. \u2028\nThe symptoms of the disease, \u2028\nmicro. \u2028\nsays a \u2028\nDrinking water, no matter how clean-looking it is should \u2028\nalways be boiled before it is taken and especially so if it is \u2028\ntapped from burst pipes and other suspect sources. \u2028\nSilent killer \u2028\nstalks towns \u2028\nThis in turn made it \u2028\nto find ways and means of \u2028\nfacilitating discussion on the \u2028\n-behavioural aspects of Aids. \u2028\nHow then the doctor deal \u2028\nwith community \u2028\nresponsibility in order to control \u2028\nthe spread of the disease there? \u2028\nConsider the case. of the \u2028\nman who has had sex \u2028\nwith a prostitute. \u2028\nThe of his having \u2028\nbeen with STD and HIV \u2028\nare very high. He has done it \u2028\nunder the influence of alcohol. \u2028\nHe may be one Of the people \u2028\nworking in a town which is away \u2028\nfrom where his Wife lives. His \u2028\nsexual encounter(s) with a \u2028\nprostitute has turned him into a \u2028\nOne of the most \u2028\ndistinguishing \u2028\nfeatures of Aids is \u2028\nthat everybody has \u2028\nto be involved in \u2028\ndealing with it as it \u2028\ndeals with sexual \u2028\nactivities \u2028\nwhich \u2028\ntouch on many \u2028\naspects of human \u2028\nlife. Aids can infect \u2028\nanybody \u2028\nwhose \u2028\nsexual behaviour \u2028\nexposes him or her \u2028\nto HIV. \u2028\npatient for which he is expected \u2028\nto seek medical care. Because of \u2028\nits close association with sex and \u2028\nSTDs. there is a lot of stigma \u2028\nattached to Aids. \u2028\nThose Who get it are \u2028\nto feel immoral. This in \u2028\ntum leads to a disruption of the \u2028\nrelationship with the family and \u2028\ncommunity thereby creating \u2028\nloneliness in the individual. \u2028\nThis \u2028\nis what makes it \u2028\nnecessary to deal with Aids as a \u2028\ndisease of the individual as well \u2028\nas the immediate family, \u2028\ncommunity and society We also \u2028\nneed to remember that \u2028\nmoralising when a has \u2028\nAids is not a curative measure. It \u2028\nshould have been applied in \u2028\nearlier counselling as a \u2028\npreventive measure. \u2028\nOur aids against Aids are in \u2028\ngetting \u2028\nthe \u2028\nmedical \u2028\nprofession fo exercigc its \u2028\nprofessional \u2028\nauthority \u2028\nespecially in continually \u2028\nproviding \u2028\nup-to-date \u2028\ninformation for meeting the \u2028\nspecific of the \u2028\non Aids, \u2028\nThe medical profession has the \u2028\nethical responsibility of \u2028\nensuring that such persons seek \u2028\nhealth \u2028\nwithout \u2028\ncare \u2028\nembarrassment. They also need \u2028\ncounselling so that they accept \u2028\ntheir responsibility of not \u2028\nspreading the disease to their \u2028\nspouses or any other sexual \u2028\npartner and hence to the \u2028\ncommunity \u2028\nA it is not easy to tell a \u2028\npatient the results which show \u2028\nthat he/she has a disease without \u2028\na cure, those diseases like cancer \u2028\nand HIV infection have one \u2028\npositive point which must be \u2028\nutilised \u2028\nthe patient will \u2028\nsurvive tong enough, if . \u2028\ndiagnosed early. to organise his/ \u2028\nher life before he/she finally \u2028\nsuccumbs to the disease.

Careless \u2028\ndumping of garbage as is \u2028\ncommon in urban centres in \u2028\nKenya should be made a \u2028\npunishable offence. \u2028\nHe also urged the Government \u2028\nand \u2028\nnon-governmental I \u2028\norganisations to \u2028\nsensitise \u2028\non the importance of \u2028\ncleanliness both at home and at \u2028\ntheir places \u2028\nUse of latrines is of great \u2028\nimportance if the disease is to be \u2028\ncontrolled as human waste Can \u2028\neasily contaminate water systems \u2028\nespecially in overcrowded areas. \u2028\nProf. Okelo urges people \u2028\nsuffering from nagging frontal \u2028\nheadaches, muscle and joint \u2028\npains, abdominal discomforts \u2028\ndiarrhoea or persistent coughs to \u2028\nseek medical help immediately. \u2028\nHe warns that delayed \u2028\nattention can easily lead to death \u2028\nthrough uncontrolled bleeding or \u2028\nperforated gut. \u2028\nWith the declining medical \u2028\nstandards and the never casing \u2028\nrise of poverty in most urban \u2028\ncentres. the only weapon against \u2028\ntyphoid and other \u2028\ndiseases is to maintain high \u2028\nstandards of cleanliness.
