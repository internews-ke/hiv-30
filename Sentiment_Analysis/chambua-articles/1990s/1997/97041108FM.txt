{"text": "A miracle of healing for Johnson?\nBy WANJA NJUGUNA\nIs it possible that Earvin 'Magic'\nJohnson has received a miracle\nof healing? Ebony Magazine's\nLaura Randolph has an\nexclusive on the' 'miracle\".\nAccording to Johnson's wife\nCookie, doctors can no longer\nfind a trace of the Aids virus in\nJohnson. \"He is still taking medication\nbut there is no virus left in\nhis blood. The doctor's explanation\nfor the results is less spiritual.\n\"They think it's the medicine,\"\nCookie says. But she and Johnson\nbelieve otherwise. They believe it .\nis the miracle each of them has\nbeen praying for since the day\nthey learned of the diagnosis.\n\"We claim it in the name of Jesus,\n\" Cookie says.\nThe couple's story, which\nseems like near fascination and\nsad, may now have a happy ending.\nIt was only two days after\nCookie learnt that she was expecting\ntheir son, E.J, that Magic\nwalked into their house and told\nher he was infected with the virus\nthat causes Aids. But when many\nwomen or men would consider\nleaving their spouses, Cookie could not leave 'Magic' though\nshe had only been married to him\nfor less than a year.\nUnlike many spouses, the\nthought of leaving did not cross\nCookie's mind. She said at the\ntime that there was too much between\nthem, too much love, too\nmany dreams, too much history.\n\"The love that we had built up\nover 14 years of dating is what I\nhold on to\" she told the media\nshortly. after Johnson, one of the\ngreatest basketballers the world has known, shocked the world in\n1991 by announcing that tests for\nan insurance policy revealed he\nwas infected with HIV, the virus\nthat causes Aids. \"There's no way\nthat I was going to leave him to\ndeal with it by himself,\" she\nexplains.\nAccording to Ebony, it wasn't\nher decision to stand by her husband\nthat caused a stir then but her\ncomment on her belief that God\nwould heal her husband, which\nwas dismissed by many people as\nas either wishful thinking or impossibly\nnaive. Cookie had said,\n\"I honestly feel that the Lord is\ngoing to heal him and that we are\ngoing to live together forever and\nhave more children and be happy.\"\nFor one who had just been\nmarried and previously having\nwaited for 14 years to see her\ndream come true, hope was going\nto be a great weapon. The couple\nhad dated since. they were freshmen\ntogether at Michigan State.\nToday, Cookie believes her\nfaith has been rewarded. \"We\nhave never been closer or more in\nlove and we have two healthy\nchildren and I am certain that God\nhas blessed us with a miracle.\" Cookie says she finds it hard to\nbelieve that since the day she\nlearnt that Johnson had been infected\nwith the Aids virus \"my\nlife has only gotten better and better.\nThis really is one of the best\ntimes of my life\".\nThis might be due to a number\nof reasons, one of which is their\nchanged outlook on life. \"Now,\nwe see every day, every moment\nas a blessing. We don't sweat the'-\nsmall stuff and most important,\nwe are taking nothing especially\neach other for granted. ' ,\nBoth Cookie and, Magic are active\nmembers of the West Angeles\nChurch of God and Christ. While\nCookie has always believed in\nGod, she has got deeper into her\nfaith.\nThey have two children, E.J,\nfour and Elisa, two. Elisa was\nadopted when she was three days\nold. But Cookie does not think she\nwill want to have the four children\nshe always yearned for.\nNow that the children are attending\nSchool, Cookie want to devote more time educating Black\nAmerica about Aids prevention.\n\"My focus is really on educating\nwomen and children, she says. \nEarvin 'Magic' Johnson"}
