{"text": "Refocus Aids control programme, Government advised\nBy NATION Reporter\n\"The Government has been advised\nto refocus the Aids Control\nand Prevention Programme\nto target specific sections of the\npopulation if the spread of HIV/Aids is to be slowed in the near\nfuture.\nAn official of the Kenya Aids\nNGOs Consortium, Mr Julius\nOchieng, says the Government\nshould seriously consider providing\nmore information and\neducation on HIV/Aids to the\nrelatively Aids-free sections of\nthe population. Speaking to the Nation on\nTuesday, Mr Ochieng identified\nthe most critical section as being\nthe 5-14 age group where the\nprevalence of the disease was\nfound to be virtually zero between\n1986 and 1996.\n\"It is important to engage primary\nschools in family life education\nto increase their awareness\nof HIV/Aids as this may be\nthe only hope of reducing the\nrate of the disease spread.\"\nHe notes that a recent study\ncarried out in Kenya and Zaire had shown that the 5-14 age\ngroup is likely to soon become a\nhigh-risk group too.\nThe study revealed that 71 per\ncent of the youth in both countries\nhave their first sexual contact\nwith an older person -\nhouse-maids, married men or\nwomen.\nThe older persons are from\nthe high-risk reproductive age\ngroup which is currently the\nworst afflicted by the disease.\nMr Ochieng argues that Kenya's\n\"blanket approach\" to the\ncontrol of HIV/Aids in the past decade has failed to slow down\nthe disease. '\nAccording to the 1996 country\nreport of the National Aids and\nStds Control Programme (NASCOP),\nthe prevalence of the\nAids virus in the adult population\nhas been growing at an\never increasing rate since 1990.\nThe report, titled \"Aids in\nKenya: Background, Projections,\nImpact, Interventions\",\nobserves that in 1990,the prevalence\nof HIV was 3.1 per cent. It\nincreased to 4,2 per cent in 1991,\nmaintaining the upward trend. In 1994, 6.7 per cent of the adult\npopulation had HIV while in\n1995 it stood at 7.5 per cent.\nThe report estimates that in\nthe next three years, people\nwith Aids will constitute 51 per\ncent of inpatients nationally.\n\"Aids will reduce the Kenyan\npopulation by 1.3 million people\nby the year 2,000.\"\nMr Ochieng says there is a\nneed for information and education\nthat will empower communities\nand vulnerable groups\nwith life skills on how to avoid\ncontracting the disease. \nNumber of HIV carriers doubles.\nBy Nation Reporter\nAt least one in every five people\nliving in urban centres is an Aids\ncarrier.\nThis represents a doubling of\nthe prevalence of the disease since\nthe last national sentinel survey\nwas undertaken in the early\nI990s.\nThe latest report of the\nNational Aids and Stds Control\nProgramme says the prevalence\nof the Aids virus in Kisumu, Busia,\nNairobi and Nakuru now lies\nbetween 20 and 30 per cent.\nChulaimbo Sub-location in\nKisumu District has the most astounding\nprevalence of the disease,\nwith about half (49 per cent)\nof the population carrying the\nvirus.\nTiwi in the South Coast has the\nsecond highest prevalence of 17\nper cent among the rural sites.\nThe 1996 programme report,\nquoting findings of a 1995 sentinel\nsurveillance of HIV, shows\nMombasa, Thika and Kakamega\nhave a prevalence of 10 to 20 per\ncent. Mosoriot, Maragwa, Mbale\nand Karurumo have a similar\nprevalence of HIV infection.\nIn areas such as Kitale, Kisii,\nMeru, Nyeri, Garissa and Kitui,\nabout one in every ten people are\nnow Aids carriers. \"Some sites\nmay have lower infection rates\nbecause of behaviour patterns or\nbecause the epidemic started later\nin these areas.\""}
