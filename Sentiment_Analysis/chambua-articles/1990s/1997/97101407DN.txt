{"text": "Take steps to curb Aids threat\nNyanza Provincial Commissioner\nWilliam Chepkwony was reported\nto have conceded that \"despite\na high level of awareness about\nAids in Nyanza, the rate of infection\nis not falling at a discernible\nrate\". The same observation applies\nelsewhere in the republic.\nIt is common for people to talk\ncasually about friends, relatives\nand neighbours who have died of\nAids and indulge in careless sex\nmoments later. This defies logic.\nIs it fatalism? Are people resigned\nto their fates in the knowledge\nthat whatever precautions\none takes time must come when\none will want-to marry and must\nresort to a \"condom less\" act with\nthe spouse? Will a high level of\nawareness in such cases help?\nAnd is there such a thing as\n\"safe sex\"? This is a truly gray\narea that seems to have been manipulated\nin the knowledge that\nthe sexual urge is invariably difficult\nto control. And thus the advocacy\nof the use of condoms even when their efficacy against the\nsmall HIV virus is suspect.\nMeanwhile, young Kenyans are\ndying and one must doubt the official figures\npublished about\npeople who have died of Aids and\nthose :who are sero-positive. They\nare much higher.\nThe following measures are inevitable:\n.\no Our children must be discouraged\nfrom engaging in premarital\nsex through a curriculum\nthat cogently addresses the issue.\nNo marriages should be consumated\nbefore HIV tests are carried\nout.\no A national programme\naimed at nurturing values that\npenalise sexual permissiveness is\nrequired.\nQ Brothels should be prohibited\nby law.\nHalfhearted measures will not\nsave our dear children from succumbing\nto this scourge.\nAnderson Omoto,\nBumala, Busia."}
