{"text": "THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 1997\n\nNew Aids vaccine set to go for trials in Uganda\n\nBy HELEN EPSTEIN\u2028\nand UWAN NSUBUGA\u2028\nA promising new experimental\u2028\nAids vaccine is to start trials in\u2028\nUganda following a stormy meeting of Ugandan and international\u2028\nexperts last September.\u2028\nThe administration of the first\u2028\ndoses of the vaccine, developed\u2028\nby the French pharmaceutical\u2028\ncompany, Pasteur Merieux, to 40\u2028\nyoung male volunteers in Kampala started early this year. \u2018\u2028\nThe trial will show how safe the\u2028\nvaccine is and, if successful, lead\u2028\nto much larger trials involving\u2028\nthousands of Ugandans in 1998.\u2028\nOnly when these trials have\u2028\nbeen completed, which could take\u2028\nuntil the year 2005, will scientists\u2028\nknow whether the vaccine can\u2028\nprotect against H1V infection. Despite this long development period, the vaccine is prompting\u2028\nhopes of a real breakthrough\u2028\nagainst HIV/AIDS in developing\u2028\ncountries. The ALVAC VCP2O5\u2028\nvaccine, as it is technically\u2028\nknown, contains live virus like the\u2028\nvaccines against polio and\u2028\nsmallpox.\u2028\nIt is a genetically engineered\u2028\nversion of the canaripox virus,\u2028\nwhich causes disease among canary birds but not \u00a1n humans, carrying several small, harmless\u2028\nfragments of HIV. The vaccine\u2028\nhas already been tested on more\u2028\nthan 100 volunteers in France and\nthe United States who have shown\u2028\nno ill effect.\u2028\nA vaccine that effectively\u2028\nblocks H1V infection is urgently\u2028\nneeded to stem the tide of H1V in\u2028\npoor communities around the\u2028\nworld. Every day, about 8,500\u2028\npeople become infected with HIV,\u2028\nninety per cent of them in developing countries.\u2028\nAn affordable vaccine which\u2028\nonly needs to be administered\u2028\nonce is believed to be a much\u2028\nmore effective medical solution to\u2028\nthe Aids epidemic than expensive\u2028\ndrug treatments.\u2028\nDuring 1996,.major gains have\u2028\nbeen made in developing drugs\u2028\nagainst HIV/Aids, but at about\u2028\n$12,000 for each person\u2019s annual\u2028\ntreatment, these are cripplingly expensive and are unlikely to benefit\u2028\ndeveloping countries.\u2028\nDespite the international importance of developing a vaccine,\u2028\nonly about one per cent of all international research funding has\nbeen spent on vaccine research.\u2028\nBut the development of an Aids\u2028\nvaccine has proved far more difficult than researchers hoped when\u2028\nHIV was first discovered in the\u2028\n1980s, and research has been be\u2028\nset both by lack of funds and, as in\u2028\nUganda, by rows over testing.\u2028\nAn intense and sometimes acrimonious public debate has surrounded the ALVAC vaccine trial\u2028\nin Uganda. :\u2028\nThe September meeting was organised by the vaccine trial\u2028\norganisers and brought together\u2028\nover 200 representatives of the\u2028\nmedical and religious communities, legal experts, counsellors,\u2028\npolicy experts and the media.\u2028\nThe meeting helped to allay\u2028\nconcerns voiced in highly critical\u2028\nattacks in the Ugandan media, and\u2028\nin street demonstrations, which\u2028\ncentred on claims that Ugandans\u2028\nwere being used as guinea pigs to\u2028\ntest a vaccine from which they\u2028\nmay never benefit.\nMost critics now appear to be\u2028\nsatisfied, \u201cWe were very concerned at the beginning of this\u2028\nprocess, but now we are assured\u2028\nthat the vaccine is safe,\u201d says\u2028\nSamuel Tindifa of the Faculty of\u2028\nLaw at Makerere University.\u2028\nThe main reason for public ac\u2028\nceptance of the trials seems to be\u2028\nthe apparently high ethical standards being applied to the trials by\u2028\nthe organisers.\u2028\nIn collaboration with the\u2028\nNational Institutes of Health in the\u2028\nUS, the trial organisers at the Joint\u2028\nClinical Research Centre (JCRC)\u2028\nin Uganda have spent almost five\u2028\nyears preparing a cohort of young\u2028\nmale soldiers to participate in a an\u2028\nAids vaccine trial in anticipation\u2028\nof one becoming available for\u2028\ntesting.\u2028\nThe 40 participants were cho\u2028\nsen from those ranks. Using military men in Africa makes sense\u2028\nbecause they are mobile, sexually\u2028\nactive group and have a high risk\nof HlV infection.\u2028\nOne of the biggest concerns\u2028\nwas whether the tests would really\u2028\nbe voluntary.\u2028\nAnyone taking part in such trials must give their \u201cinformed\u2028\nconsent\u201d under the rules of the\u2028\nHelsinki Declaration on Human\u2028\nRights. Concern was strong be\u2028\ncause the volunteers were soldiers\u2028\nfrom the Ugandan Army, who are\u2028\nused to following orders. .\u2028\nIn response to criticism, Major\u2028\nRubamira Ruranga, who works as\u2028\nan Aids counsellor for the JCRC\u2028\nargues that volunteers are lining\u2028\nup for the injections.\u2028\n\u201cThey want to be part of the\u2028\nstruggle,\u201d says Major Ruranga\u2028\nwho s HIV positive himself and\u2028\nis founder of the National Network of People Living with HIV/\u2028\nAids.\u2028\nConcern over the trial has also\u2028\nfocused on whether the vaccine\u2028\nwill be affordable in Uganda.\u2028\n(PANOS)"}
