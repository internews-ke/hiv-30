{"text": "Act on shocking Aids deaths figures\nThis is as staggering as it is shattering. In fact, it is shocking.\nA seminar in Kisumu was told on Monday that a total of\n2,700 teachers die of Aids in what some have come to call\nLuo Nyanza.\nAt the same time, it was revealed that children aged eight\nwere involved in the sex trade and that that was rampant\nthroughout Nyanza Province except for one district.\nThe point is, everybody knows that Aids is a killer and that\nthe disease is 100 per cent fatal. Everybody knows the Aids causing\nHIV virus is transmittable through sexual intercourse.\nAnd, we assume, every comer of this country is not\nfree or immune from the HIV virus or Aids.\nThe best possible way of keeping Aids at bay is for people\nto refrain from multiple sex, stop having unprotected sex and\nstick to the partners they know or have always known. As we\nhave said in these columns before, Mr Mwai Kibaki put it aptly\nwhen as HealtJ1 Minister in 1988, he said, \"watu waache\nkutangatanga (people should stop roaming about)\" ..\nWhen a seminar is told that more than 2,000 people die\nyearly in a certain part of any province of this country from\nAids, the logical conclusion from this statement is that watu\nwanatangatanga.\nAnd the revelation that eight-year-olds are involved in\nrampant prostitution in Nyanza, can only mean that soon this\narea will be populated by graves and walking skeletons.\nIt is now incumbent upon the organisers of these seminars\nor the Ministry of Health to go further and tell Kenyans what\n.research shows about deaths caused by Aids in other parts of\nthe country. Quite a few questions come to mind.\nIs it only in the so-called Luo Nyanza where more than\n2,000 teachers are dying of Aids every year? What IS the scenario\nin the major urban areas given that most of Luo Nyanza\nis rural? Is the problem peculiar to teachers or are other professions\naffected? These questions and many others are pertinent\nif the Aids scenario in Kenya is to be understood.\nIndeed, from these kinds of inquiries it will be easy to arrive\nat possible solutions to the spread of Aids, not only in\nLuo Nyanza, but also all over the country without resorting to\nstereotyping. In the meantime, rather than use such information\nto condemn, it is infinitely more useful to counsel."}
