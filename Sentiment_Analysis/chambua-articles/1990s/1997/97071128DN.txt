{"text": "JULY 11, 1997 \n'We have a duty to the young' \u2028\nMore than 100 countries, as well as \u2028\ninstitutions, non-governmental \u2028\nand private organisations, are \u2028\ncommemorating today, World \u2028\npopulation Day. \u2028\npopulation Day Was \u2028\nfirst celebrated in 1987 When the world population reached 5 billion. In 1988, the United \u2028\nNations authorised the event to be celebrated \u2028\nannually on I July as a vehicle to build \u2028\nawareness of population issues and the impact they have on development and the environment. \u2028\nThe theme for this year's World Population \u2028\nDay is adolescent reproductive health \u2028\ncare, focusing on the need to prepare them so \u2028\nthat they can make informed choices, including how to protect themselves from unwanted \u2028\npregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases \u2028\nincluding HIV/Aids. \u2028\nThere are more than a billion young people \u2028\nin the world today aged between IS and 24 \u2028\nthe biggest new generation ever. As these \u2028\nnew baby boomers enter their adulthood, \u2028\nmany Of them are concerned With getting \u2028\nmarried, starting a family and bringing up \u2028\ntheir children  good health. Others have decided to put off marriage for a while and \u2028\nbuild a life on their own, \u2028\nWhether their priorities are marriage or a \u2028\ncareer, today's young people have their own \u2028\nchoices to make, They are more health-conscious than any previous generation \u2014 and \u2028\nreproductive health is important- They 'want to behave responsibly , to protect their health and the health of those they \u2028\nlove, and because it is the right thing to do. \u2028\nWe know this because last year we asked \u2028\nteenagers all over the world to tell us What \u2028\ntheir priorities are. Overwhelmingly, we \u2028\nfound, they want to know. They want information about sexuality, and about sexual \u2028\nhealth. They want to know how to protect \u2028\nthemselves and their loved ones from un- \u2028\nwanted pregnancy, from sexually-transmitted \u2028\ndiseases, including HIV/Aids, and from re- \u2028\nproductive tract infection, We, their elders \u2028\nand those responsible at all levels. in the \u2028\nhome and the community, in government and \u2028\ninternational organisations, have a duty to \u2028\nthese young people. They are a generation of \u2028\ngreat promise: but we also have promises to \u2028\nkeep, 'n particular the promises made by all \u2028\ncountries at the International Conference On \u2028\nPopulation and Development in 1994. \u2028\nWe must ensure that young people not Only \u2028\nknow the choices open to them but have the \u2028\nappropriate information and services to help \u2028\nthem make the right decisions. We must protect the health of young people and we must \u2028\neradicate customs such as female genital mutilation which threaten their lives and well- \u2028\nbeing. Teenage pregnancy is a fact with \u2028\nwhich all communities must live. Ignoring it \u2028\nWill not make it go away. Instead, we must do \u2028\neverything in power to teenage \u2028\nactions can be With them all their lives. \u2028\nWe have to inform not only young women \u2028\nbut their families and their prospective husbands that pregnancy before they are 8 will \u2028\nendanger their lives and Of their babies. \u2028\nWe have to make sure that young people and \u2028\ntheir parents are aware of the risks of sexual \u2028\nactivity \u2014 that more than half of new HIV \u2028\ninfections are among the 15-24 age group, \u2028\nthat is the group at highest risk Of STDs and \u2028\nthat young women are more at risk than their \u2028\nmale partners. Some older men are prepared \u2028\nto risk young women's lives and health for \u2028\ntheir sexual gratification \u2014 young women \u2028\nand their parents need to know those risks as \u2028\nwell. \u2028\nPoverty is the enemy Of everyone, young \u2028\nor Old, Better health and education help \u2028\nyoung t? escape from poverty and \u2028\nhelp their \u2028\neducation for all, and close the gender gap in \u2028\neducation, so that girls have an equal opportunity With boys. For young women especially, education is the path to a better world. We \u2028\nhave to ensure that young women know their \u2028\nrights and that young men respect those \u2028\nrights. e must work for equality between \u2028\ngirls and boys, so that there will be equality \u2028\nbetween women and men. \u2028\nWe have it in our power to do all these \u2028\nthings. These are the reasons why UNFPA \u2028\nhas dedicated World population Day this year \u2028\nto the new generation, and their reproductive \u2028\nresponsibility and make sure that you \u2028\npeople know that the consequences of "}
