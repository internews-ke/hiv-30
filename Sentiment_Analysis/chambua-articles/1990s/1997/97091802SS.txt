{"text": "Commercial sex and the spread of Aids\nWomen commercial sex workers\nare more vulnerable to Aids infection\nthan the rest of women\nbecause of the high rate of client\nchange. This is particularly so\namong poor women commercial\nsex workers in poor urban and rural\nareas who suffer from high\nrates of sexually transmitted diseases\n(STDs) for which they may\nreceive little or no treatment.\nProstitution is the practice of\nsex for financial and other material\ngains. One of the reasons for\nthis is the lack of material and\nother resources driving a lot of\ngirls into the trade. In particular,\nthe girl who gets pregnant at a\ntime when she does not want to\nand becomes an unmarried mother\nwithout any kind of support is\nmore likely to get into prostitution\nthan she would otherwise\nhave done. Such a girl finds herself being\ndependent on sex to get\nthe material gains she needs from\nthe man with whom she has sex.\nProstitution in the country is\non the increase due to' lack of alternative\nmeans of earning a living.\nThis is one of the reasons\nwhy prostitutes appreciate the\nimportance of taking preventive\nmeasures . In Africa, people are forced\ninto the trade by poverty. It must\nbe understood that prostitutes,\njust like anybody else need cash\nto pay rent, buy food and other\nbasic necessities of life. Another\nimportant point to emphasize\nabout the sex trade: is that there is\na market which is created, demanded\nand sustained by men\nand that this market would not be\nthere if men stopped demanding\nit.\nThis in turn means that the society\ncan do something to address\nthe social and economic conditions\nof women to reduce their\ntendency to resort to the sex\ntrade.\nThe coming of Aids makes\nthis a matter of great urgency.\nProstitutes are not only daughters,\nsisters, mothers and grandmothers,\nthey are human beings. Our aids against Aids are in\nknowing that. commercial\nsex workers or prostitutes\nare more vulnerable to infection\nby Aids because of the\nlarge number of clients with\nwhom they have sex. One of the reasons for this is that many of the women, as receptive\nsexual partners, get sores caused\nby sexually transmitted diseases\nwhich mayor may not be evident\nor cause any symptoms. The\nsores become the. entry points for\nthe Aids virus. Over 60 per cent\n. of prostitutes of low socio-economic\nstatus have been found to\nbe HIV positive while the figures\nfor those of high socio-economic\nstatus is about 30 per cent. The\nhighest HIV infection rates are\nfound in prostitutes who had not\nhad any preventive health education. Our aids against Aids are in\nrealizing that one of the social\nproblems related to prostitution\nis the increasing\nprevalence of sexually transmitted\ndiseases. In many countries, commercial.\nsex workers are regarded as the\nleading reservoir and means of\nspread of sexually transmitted\ndiseases. This includes those who\nare licensed. The increasing\nprevalence of these diseases has\ntherefore been heavily blamed on\nprostitutes. It must however be\nrepeatedly emphasized that promiscuity\namong the general public\nis. an even more important\ncause of the rapid spread of these\ndiseases than prostitution as\nsuch.\nThe result of the general increase\nin promiscuity in many\ncountries of the world is therefore\nthat the spread of sexually\ntransmitted diseases has extended\nto the general public in such a\nway that prostitutes alone can no longer be blamed.\nOur aids against Aids are in knowing that changing sexual partners, having sex with people who have many other partners or people we do not know will aid the spread of Aids. This knowledge will aid us in avoiding such sexual encounters.\nIt must however be emphasized\nthat if both the male and female\naspects of prostitutions were to\nbe taken into consideration, one\nof the most important measures\nfor controlling the spread of sexually\ntransmitted diseases would\nbe for males to avoid having sexual\ncontact with prostitutes.\nHowever, whenever men are engaged\nin sexual contact \u00b7with\nprostitutes, it becomes essential\nfor them to wear condoms to\navoid getting infected.\nOn the side of prostitutes, the\nbest measure against sexually\ntransmitted diseases has been\nfound to be given adequate treatment\nwith antibiotics. Adequacy\nof treatment being maintained over prolonged periods because of their frequent exposure to sexually transmitted diseases. Antibiotics\nare very effective when\nused correctly under the supervision\nof doctors. This medical supervision\nis essential because of\nthe likelihood of the germs becoming\nresistant to drugs is a\nvery real one when the treatment\nis given over prolonged periods.\nIt is therefore. necessary to provide\nadequate education to women\ncommercial sex workers, on\nSTD/HIV/Aids, so as to empower\nthem to take preventive measures.\nIn the long-term however,\nwe have to find ways and means\nof reducing prostitution by providing\nalternative occupations\nfor women sex commercial\nworkers and to reduce the market\ndemand created by men for commercial\nsex.\nOur aids against Aids are in\nknowing that prostitution\ncontributes a lot to the\nspread of the disease but that\nthe society can do something\nabout it.\nAn Aids Education Programme P.O Box 72454 Nairobi."}
