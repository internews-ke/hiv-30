{"text": "Researchers cause a hue and cry\nBy CHRIS ERASMUS in Cape Town\nThe hue and cry which has followed the\nnews that four South African researchers\nhave developed one of the most promising\nand low-cost treatments for Aids and\nHIV infection yet has set back Aids treatment programmes in this county and\nelsewhere. I,\nThe uproar over claims that the experimental\ndrug Virodene P058 can dramatically\nreduce the number of Human Immunodeficiency\nviral particles not only in\nthe blood but other body tissues, as well\nas allow the body to rebuild its crucial Tcell\nnumbers, has been as much about the\nfailure of scientists who discovered the\ndrug to follow correct channels as' about\nthe extraordinary claims made for Virodene\n.. To say that their claims have caused a\nfurore within the SA medical fraternity is\nan understatement.\nNow the experimental treatment protocols\nadopted by the University of Pretoria .\nscientists are being examined, along with\nthe ethics of their clinical trials.\nThe results of those investigations will\nbe known within the next week-to-IO\ndays.\nWhile the drug's performance, based\non in vitro (test-tube) trials and a 10-patient\npilot study, appears to be sufficiently\ninteresting to warrant further investigation,\nthere may be some slaps on the\nwrists of its discoverers for cutting\ncorners.\nBut the greatest damage appears to\nhave been done by what is being seen as sensationalist media coverage of the\nleaked news that the researchers had\nmade a presentation to President Nelson\nMandela's Cabinet on their provisional\nfindings in support of an application for a\nUS$800,000 research funding proposal.\nThe National Aids Convention of\nSouth Africa (NACOSA) has protested\nthat the headline coverage of the drug has\ngiven South Africa's estimated two million\nHIV population false hopes of a cure.\nNACOSA, an umbrella body for South\nAfrican non-governmental organisations\nworking on HIV/Aids, says people living\nwith HIV also have had their expectations\nunrealistically raised for an immediate\nand affordable treatment.\nVirodene will, say its discoverers, cost\na tiny fraction of the current multi-drug cocktail treatment designed to prevent\nprogression from HIV-positive status into\nfull-blown Aids.\nInstead of$30,000 for 18 months of the\ncocktail treatment, Virodene should cost\nbetween $17.50 and $35 dollars a month\nfor a six-to-eight week treatment.\nprogramme - should it prove to be what\nit is claimed to be..\n\"Aids education and prevention work\nhave been sidelined by the sensational\npresentation to the Cabinet and the accompanying\nmedia coverage,\" says an\nunhappy NACOSA.\nBut while agreeing with that assessment,\nAids workers concede that Health\nMinister Nkosazanll Zuma must bear at\nleast partial blame for the situation.\nIt was Dr Zuma who heard about Virodene Virodene\nrelatively soon after it was discovered\na year ago and who arranged for the\nresearchers to make their presentation to\nMandela and his Cabinet.\n,That, however, does not change the bitter\ntaste in the mouths of Aids workers\nwho have been labouring under ever-diminishing\nfunds for their treatment, education\nand prevention programmes while\nthe Aids plague has swept through South\nAfrica's population as it has done elsewhere\nin Africa.\nSA's national programme to combat\nHIV and sexually-transmitted diseases\n(STDs) - of which the Aids education\nand awareness campaign has been a crucial\npart - has become something of the\nCinderella of South Africa's health revolution.\nSA 'wonder drug'\nshrouded in secrecy\nThe South African Govern-;\nrnent's interest in the Aids'\n\"wonder drug\" Virodene is reported to be a desire to have a direct\nfinancial stake in the drug's\ndevelopment to guarantee it a\nsay in its production and sales.\nThe overall aim, claims the\nWeekly Mail and Guardian\nnewspapers published in Johannesburg, is to have a low-cost,\n. treatment option available for'\nState institutions as Aids and\nHIV infection rates sky-rocket. '\nThe newspaper claims that 'I\n\"Cabinet insiders\" claimed it\nwould be better for Government\u00b7\nto \"own\" the drug so it could be\nused cheaply and quickly in\nState hospitals, rather than to allow pharmaceutical companies'\nto develop it overseas for sale at\na high price.\nThe Trade and Industry Department,\nwhich offers funding\nfor such projects, has apparently\nreceived a dossier on Virodene:\n. in the last few days and is considering funding its developrnent.\nThe Mandela Government's alleged interest in a financial\nstake in the drug may go some\nway to explain why the discovery\nof the compound was kept\nsecret until a recent Cabinet\nbriefing.\nGovernment spokesmen are\nnot keen to comment further on\nthe drug until it has passed ethical\nand SA Medicines Control\nCouncil reviews.\nHealth Minister Nkosazana\nZuma did not consult senior officials\nin her department about\nthe drug until very recently and\nthe department's Chief Director\nof Research, Dr Mohammed\nJeenah says he still has not been\nconsulted.\nThe head of the department's\nHIV /Sexually- Transmitted Directorate\nwas only briefed on\nthe matter this week.\nCryo-Preservations Technologies,\nthe recently-created company\nwhich owns the Virodene\npatent, is unwilling to discuss\nwhether it has signed any contracts\nwith the Government or\nany other agency.\n~By Chris Erasmus"}
