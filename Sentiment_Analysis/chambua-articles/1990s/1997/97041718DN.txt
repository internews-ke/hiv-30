{"text": "New disease from HIV/Aids\nBy CATHERINE MGENDI\nThe HIV/Aids epidemic has borne\na new disease which is seriously\njeopardising efforts to curtail the\nspread of the scourge, the Kenya\nAids NGO Consortium says.\nThe new disease called Afraids\n- Acute Fear Regarding Aids - mainly\nafflicts people with HIV/Aids as well as those living with such people.\nThe disease, primarily caused\nby discrimination and social rejection\nof people with Aids, is\ntypified by denial and concealment\nof HIV /Aids status or of\npeople with Aids as well as the inability\nto openly discuss the\nscourge.\nAfraids, the Aids NGOs say, is\ntransmitted casually through graffiti,\ngossip, jokes, sensationalist\nnews, and some theologically, politically and socially conservative\ntelevision and radio evangelists.\nThe Aids Consortium says:\n\"Stigmatisation and discrimination\nagainst people with HIV /Aids\nand their children is a serious\nproblem in Kenya, which causes\npersonal pain and hampers efforts\nintended to respond to the needs\nof those infected and affected.\"\nAfraids, the Aids body says,\ndrives the affected persons underground\nand away from public \nhealth initiatives to avoid detection\nand the consequent shunning.\n\"The stigma and fear regarding\nAids hinders openness about HIVI\nAids. Lack of openness and discussion\nprovide' an environment\nwhich only facilitates rapid and\nunderground spread of HIVI\nAids,\" the NGOs say.\nThe Aids NGO Consortium, in its Policy Advocacy Paper No.\n2, released a report recently as a\nresult of calls for innovative information,\neducation and communication\napproaches and strategies ..\nThe Consortium says: \"The\ntime has come for activities to\nchange from a mass undifferentiated communication for [increasing] general awareness to a well planned, intensive, personalised.\nand target oriented approach\nwhich can foster and sustain the\ndesired change in behaviour.\" Health-care providers, who are:\nidentified as being largely responsible for creating and perpetrating Afraids, should be targeted for\ntraining in counselling and communication skills, the Aids body\nrecommends. The Afraids initiative is funded by USAID."}
