{"text": "New hope in search for Aids cure\nNatural Molecule may become wonder drug\nBy PAUL RECER\nWashington: Researchers have identified\na natural molecule that prevents HIV\nfrom infecting cells, a basic discovery\nthey say could lead eventually to powerfu1 new types of Aids drugs or even a vaccine.\nThe molecule, discovered by a team\nled by famed AIDS researcher Robert\nGallo, works against HIV by physically\nblocking the portal used by the virus to invade\nlymphocytes and other types of\nblood cells.\nGallo's team at the Institute of Human\nVirology at the University of Maryland,\nBaltimore, earlier identified three similar\nmolecules, all called chemokines. But the\nnew molecule is much more effective because\nit protects all the cell types attacked\nby HIV, Gallo said.\nFlooding the body with these chemokines\ncould create a barrier between HIV\nand its target cells, and, thus, prevent the\nvirus from spreading its deadly infection,\nGallo said.\n\"Its breadth of activity and its potency\nwill make it more important than any of\nthe other chemokines found so far,\"\nGallo said in an interview.\nBut he emphasized that 'before chemokines\ncan be tried against HIV in humans,\nthe molecules must be extensively tested\nin monkeys against a related virus called\nSIV. Such testing could take several\nyears.\nDiscovery of the new chemokine\ncomes just as doctors report that some\nAids virus is developing a resistance to\nthe three-drug combination that has successfully\nsuppressed HIV in thousands of\npatients. That combination of reverse\ntranscriptase and protease inhibitors\nworks against the virus inside the target\ncell.\nChemokines would work against HIV\nby preventing the virus from entering\nthose' cells. The virus is thought to be less\nable to develop a resistance against this\nblocking action.\nThe discovery \"sounds very promising\"\nas a new type of treatment against\nthe disease, said Patricia D'Souza, an\nAids researcher at the National Institute\nof Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\"This chemokine appears to inhibit the\nviruses that appear early, as well as those\nthat develop later,\" said D'Souza. \"It might be really valuable in preventing infection,\nas well as preventing the progression\nof the disease.\"\nThe study by Gallo and his team was\ndue to be published on Friday in the journal\nScience.\nChemokines have been the subject of\nintense study by Aids researchers since\nthe discovery a decade ago that the molecules\nsomehow work to suppress HIV,\nand are secreted by immune-system\nblood cells in response to HIV infection.\nTheir natural function is to attach to\nwhite blood cells, which are the body's\nmajor disease fighters, and guide those\ncells to the site of an infection.\nEarlier, research showed that chemokines\nattached to white blood cell surfaces\nat the same points, called receptors,\nthat were used by the HIV virus. The scientists\nalso found that some strains of\nHIV concentrated on one type of receptor,\nwhile other strains targeted other receptors.\nIf the chemokimis prove effective, he\nsaid, it may be possible to control HIV infection\nwith periodic injections of a\n\"cocktail\" of several types of chemokines.\nIt may also be possible to create a vaccine\nthat prompts the body to produce\nhigh amounts of the HIV-specific chemokines.\nThat, in theory, could prevent the\ninitial HIV infection.\nMeanwhile, US researchers said last\nweek they had decided to drop segments\nof Aids trials in Africa in which subjects\nreceived only placebos and no drugs, but\ndenied they were doing so in response to\nrecent criticism.\nThe trials were designed to see whether\ndrug treatments could stop pregnant\nwomen from passing on the virus that\ncauses Aids to their babies. More than\n830,000 children around the world are infected\nwith human immunodeficiency virus\nand most got it from their mothers.\nThe trials have been criticized because\nsome of the women get placebos instead\nof drugs. Placebo arms are important to\nscientific trials because they provide a\nbaseline measurement.\nGroups like Public Citizen, founded by\nconsumer advocate Ralph Nader, criticised\nthe trials saying it was unfair to\nwithhold potentially life-saving therapy\nfrom anybody. Last month Marcia Angell, editor of\nthe prestigious New England Journal of\nMedicine, weighed in with her own\nattack.\nShe likened the researchers to those\nwho carried out now-infamous experiments\nin which black men with syphilis in\nTuskeegee, Alabama, were deliberately\nnot treated for 40 years.\nThe Journal also published Public Citizen's\ncriticisms.\nAids researchers have defended the trials.\nas completely ethical, saying that\nhardly anyone in Africa would get such\ndrugs were it not for the trials.\nA spokesman for Johns Hopkins University\nconfirmed that the placebo arm of\none trial in Ethiopia had been dropped,\nbut denied the controversy had anything\nto do with it.\n\"The change had to do with science,\"\nhe said. He said a separate trial in Thai- land, being conducted in part by Harvard\nUniversity researchers. had provided evidence\nthat it would not affect results if all\nthe women were treated.\nPublic Citizen had said in a letter to\nHealth and Human Services Secretary\nDonna Shalala that it had obtained information\nthat the placebo arm was being\ndropped in the Ethiopia study, which is\nbeing funded by the National Institutes of\nHealth (NIH) and the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention (CDC).\nThey also said they had unpublished\ndata that showed even a very short course\nof drugs before delivery would help prevent\nthe transmission of HIV from mother\nto baby.\n\"On the basis of the new information,\nwe demand that you immediately order\nthe researchers to stop any arm of their\nstudies in which women are denied access\nto antiretroviral drugs and to provide at least short-term AZT for all women now\ngetting a placebo or other unproven treatments,\"\nthe letter read.\nStandard treatment for HIV-infected\nwomen in the United States is now to give\nthem Aids drugs such as AZT while they\nare pregnant, in an intravenous infusion\nwhile they are in labour. and then to give\nthe drugs to babies after delivery.\nScientists say this greatly reduced\nmother-to-child transmission.\nBut in developing countries like those\nin Africa where Aids is most rampant,\ndrugs like these are far beyond the means\nof patients and health authorities. Researchers\nare trying to see if there IS a\ncheaper way to stop babies from getting\ninfected.\nNIH researchers involved in the study\nwere not immediately available for\ncomment.\nMeanwhile. a five-day meeting began\nin Manila yesterday to draw up a strategy\nto combat the spread of Aids in the Asia Pacific region ..\nThe 4th International Congress on Aids\nin Asia and the Pacific will focus on preventive\nmeasures as well as theoretical\ncures and vaccines for the lethal disease,\nAids Society of the Philippines president\nOfelia Monson said.\nIt also hopes to improve coordination\namong governments, professional\ngroups, non-government orgamsal1ons\nand other sectors in fighting Aids.\n\"The complexities of Aids factors\nneed to be looked at in the setting of problems\nspecific to the Asia-Pacific,\" Monson\nsaid.\nPhilippine President Fidel Ramos was\nto formally open the conference being attended\nby 2.500 delegates from around\nthe world at a seaside convention centre\nin Manila yesterday.\nKeynote speakers include World\nHealth Organisation chief for the Western\nPacific Sang Tae Han, Peter Piot of the\nGeneva-based UN Aids and Philippine\nHealth Secretary Carmencita Reodiea.\nGeoff Mandy, country programme adviser\nof UN Aids, the United Nations initiative\nto monitor the disease, said that of\nthe 30 million people worldwide believed\ninfected with the virus that causes Aids,\nonly five million to ,even million were in\nthe Asia-Pacific region.\nBut, the region hosts about half the\nworld's population. meaning it has \"potentially\nmore people who could become\ninfected,\" he said. \"We have the opportunity\nto prevent that from happening.\"\nAids kills by tearing down the body's\nimmune system.
