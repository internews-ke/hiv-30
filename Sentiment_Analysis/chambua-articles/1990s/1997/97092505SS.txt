{"text": "Aids: What should Women most\nexposed to\nkiller disease\nOne of the most worrying aspects\nof Aids is the vulnerability of\nwomen to it. Up to 10 per cent of\nwomen attending an antenatal\nclinic may be found to have the\nAids virus.\nWith regard to sexually transmitted\ndiseases (STDs), up to between\n14 and 17 per cent of women\nattending a family planning\nclinic may be found to have had\ngonorrhoea.\nThese high figures are due to\nthe large number of gonorrhoea\ngerms which have become resistant\nto drugs. Resistance to drugs\noccurs when inadequate treatment '\ndosage of the drug are used. If\nsuch inadequate treatment is continued,\nthen the resistant germs\nwill not be killed and will continue\nto spread gonorrhoea without\ncontrol.\nThis situation is compounded\nby inadequate or lack of contact\ntracing. The inevitable result is.\nrapid spread of gonorrhoea and its\ncomplications such as infertility\nand now Aids.\n*** Our aids against Aids are in\nknowing that women are\nmore vulnerable than men to\nAids.\nIn general, we have to constantly\nremind ourselves that this worrying\ntrend has come about through\nthe relatively recent creation of a\npopulation of urban workers that\nhas led to the availability of money\nand leisure time to spend on\nsex.\nMost of these people are in the\nage group 20-50 years old and\nhave the resources, the cars and\nhouses to be able to pursue sex\nwith multiple partners, including\nprostitutes.\nMany of them do it because\nthey work and live in towns away\nfrom their families who may be in\nthe rural areas. Although the disease\ncut across people of all social\nand economic status, we must remember\nthat the educated and the\nleaders are' concentrated in urban\nareas where a relatively large\nnumber of them' are getting the\nAids virus and disease.\nThe Aids virus has thus spread\nin the general population through\nthe increasing infection of wives\nby their promiscuous husbands.\nIt is these urban workers who\nfirst came into contact with international\nprostitutes and got infected\nwith HIV in the 1970s. It was\nthese, infected urban workers who\ndeveloped full blown Aids in the\n1980s. At that time, practically\nevery man who had Aids had got\nit from an international prostitute.\nInternational prostitutes an,\nwomen who earn foreign exchange\nby letting their bodies sexually,\neither by moving from one\ncountry to another, or in different\nurban areas of their own countries.\nThey then go back to their\nhomes in both urban and rural areas where they continue to play\na major role in spreading the disease\nto other sexual partners.\nMen have thus created a rapidly\ngrowing and lucrative market for\nfemale commercial sex worker to\nearn their livelihood. In practice,\nthis means that men have given\ntheir approval to the practice of\nthe female earning her living commercially\nto meet the market demands\nof men. This practice is associated\nwith heavy alcoholic\ndrinking and promiscuity.\n*** Our aids against Aids are in\nbeing educated about international\nprostitution.\n*** Promiscuity is closely associated\nwith a high incidence of sexually\ntransmitted diseases and is also related\nto having sex with barmaids,\nnight club girls and prostitutes.\nA considerable proportion of\nyoung people do not know that\nsex could result in pregnancy and\n, sexually transmitted disease when\nthey start. In promiscuity, it is the\nurge to have new partners which is\nthe driving force rather than the\nurge to have frequent sex.\n*** Our aids against Aids is in\neducating our young people\nabout the possibility of getting\nSTDs in their first sexual\nencounter. There has also been a significant\nincrease in indiscriminate and casual\nsexual activities in offices,\nshops, institutions and a multiplicity\nof other venues. These\npractices have been associated\nwith an increasing number of sexual\ncontacts with partners that one\ndoes not even know anything\nabout.\nThis makes it particularly difficult\nfor the medical profession in\nthe process of trying to identify\nthe contacts for examination and\ntreatment. The general increase in\ntravel to holidays or international\nmeetings has also resulted in temporary\nand casual sexual contacts.\nAll these changes have raised\nserious questions as to what is to\nbe taught to the youth. The traditional\nrestraining influences of religion, family and society in general\nhave lost their authoritative\nvalue. This means therefore that\nmore appropriate social values\nand ethics are need to be developed\nupheld and taught by\nmodem society to give guidance\ntowards what is regarded today as\n'the most desirable patterns of\nhuman sexual behaviour.\nOur aids against Aids are in\nbeing educated about what is\nthe most desirable pattern of\nsexual behaviour for modern\nsociety.\nAn Aids Education\nProgramme, P.O. Box 72<154,\nNairobi.\n\nThe press for sensitization\nln the year 2,000, 40 million people will be infected\nwith HIV, the virus that causes Aids.\nForty-two per cent of them will live in Asia.\nDespite this threat, many Asian journalists\naren't telling their. readers and viewers what\nthey need to know to protect themselves from\ninfection because of cultural taboos that keep\nthem from discussing unsafe sexual practices.\nAn expert on health care in developing\ncountries in an issue of the Lancet talks about\nthe effect th<,se cultural taboos are having on\nthe coverage of HIV and Aids in the Asian\nmedia.\n\".Massive educational programmes to mobilise the whole population are badly needed to\nchange sexual practices,\" warns Dr Ivan\nWoHlers of the VU-University in Amsterdam,\nNetherlands.\nFor such programmes to be effective, the\nsexual practices that put people at risk for infection must be discussed openly in the print\nand broadcast media.\nUnfortunately, this isn't being done because\nmost of the journalists in Asia feel they can't\ndiscuss sexual behaviour frankly in their articles\nor broadcasts, Wolffers says.\nUnlike their counterparts in Europe and\nNorth America, who have played a leading\nrole in rasing awareness of unsafe sexual practices\nand who have helped change attitudes towards\nthose stricken with this- disease, most\nAsian journalists \"have done little to change\nexisting' cultural values and prejudices about\nsexuality and the situation of people who are living with HIV or Aids.\nWolffers, who over the past three years has\nparticipated in a series of workshops with\nAsian media workers in Turkey, Bangladesh,\nMalaysia, Vietnam and Thailand, says Asian\njournalists appeared to have \"adopted several\nstrategies that are used to ensure that the Asian HIV reality is ignored.\"\nFor example, instead of pointing out the sexual\npractices that increase the risk of HIV infection,\nnews coverage in some countries has\ngiven the impression that HIV can only be\nspread by contaminated blood or that it is primarily\na disease of intravenous drug users or a\ndisease that afflicts only foreigners and those\nwho adopt foreign lifestyles.\nWorkshop participants told Wolffers that\nthey don't write about unsafe sexual ,practices\nbecause to do so would be \"against their\nculture. \"\nAmong the excuses given, he says, were:\n\"We Thais don' like to talk about it,\" \"In Indonesian\nculture you don't discuss it,\" and\n\"Vietnamese are very shy.\"\nBut Wolffers argues that culture isn't something\nthat is set in stone. Culture, he says, is\njust a way of interpreting reality, and it\nchanges when realities change."}
