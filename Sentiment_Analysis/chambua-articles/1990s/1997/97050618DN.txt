Monday\nThe BBC World Service last week\nstarted a six-part special series of\nprogrammes on Aids in Africa\nwhich will include a look at some\nof the \"quacks who claim to have\ncures\".\nThe programme, Surviving Aids, draws on the personal experiences\nof Africans, to offer essential\ninformation on HIV and Aids\nand the ways in which people can\nprotect themselves. \"The basic premise of the series\nis to give people information and\nlet them make their own informed\njudgments,\" said producer Ruth\nEvans. \"The whole subject of\nAids can, understandably, be a\nvery depressing one but we'll be\nintroducing some lighter moments\nfocusing on the conventional\nand the unconventional -\nfrom the scientists who have broken\ndown the genetic make-up of\nthe virus to the witchdoctors and\nquacks who claim to have cures. We even have a paint-on latex 'liquidom'\n(condom) from South\nAfrica which is available in rocket\nred or lunar yellow.\"\nThe BBC says that material for\nthe programme has been collected\nfrom throughout sub-Saharan\nAfrica.\nSurviving Aids will investigate\nboth the medical debates surrounding\nAids, the impact of Aids\non society and the economy, the\nmyths and the future of the syndrome."}
