{"text": "\nFEBRUARY 27, 1997\n\nGetting ready and tying the marriage knot\n\nOne of the institutions which is\u2028\nseriously affected by Aids is marriage. With increasing rates of\u2028\npremarital sex, the question has\u2028\nbeen raised as to whether or not\u2028\nmarrying couples should be advised to undergo HIV testing.\u2028\nThe answer to this question depends very much on the back\u2028\ngrounds, habits and beliefs of the\u2028\nMarrying couples.\u2028\nFor example, in the case of couples who know one another thoroughly, including their respective family upbringing and the values\u2028\nand ethics they hold about sexuality, testing is not necessary, unless\u2028\nthe marrying couple wish to do it voluntarily on their own.\u2028\nHowever, in view of the traditional belief in Africa that a man\u2028should have children before he dies, there is a growing tendency for young men to marry when they discover that they are infected.\u2028\nThey do this without telling their\u2028\nwives and sooner or later they are\u2028\nleave behind infected wives and\u2028\nbabies. In such cases, testing is\u2028\nnecessary.\u2028\nIf one of them is found to be infected it means they cannot get\u2028\nmarried or, if they do, they cannot have children because they will have to use condoms effectively every time.\u2028\nOur aids against Aids are in the\nknowledge that the marrying couple have of another\u2019s values and\u2028\nhabits.\u2028\nThe institution of marriage has\u2028\nbeen weakened further by the\u2028\ngrowing pattern of searching and\u2028\nfinding sexual pleasure outside it.\u2028\nBecause of this, marriage has\u2028\nironically become one of the ways\u2028\nof spreading Aids into the general\u2028\npopulation.\u2028\nOur aids against Aids are in intensifying the education of young\npersons on the purpose and nature\u2028\nof marriage .\u2028\nThere have been cases where a\u2028\nyoung woman has been tricked by\u2028\na young man into having sex on\u2028\nthe false promise of marriage.\u2028\nWhen that happens it is vital for\u2028\nthe girl to lest the seriousness of\u2028\nthe man by insisting on following\u2028\nthe essential arrangements for\u2028\nmarriage. This will help to sort out\u2028\nthose men who are serious about\u2028\nmarriage and those who are not.\u2028\nOur aids against Aids is in en-\u2028\nswing that our youth take marriage seriously.\u2028\nIn today\u2019s economy there is a\u2028\ngrowing tendency to commercialise the requirements. There is no standard price for animals meant\u2028\nfor dowry. There is also a tendency for many girls\u2019 parents to try\u2028\nand settle their own financial\u2028\nproblems by asking for amounts\nof money which leave the marry-\u2028\n\u00a1ng couple stressed and strained.\u2028\nIn view of the increasingly un-\u2028\naffordable costs being imposed in\u2028\nmarriage preparation by the girls\u2019\u2028\nparents, it appears necessary for communities to make an effort to\u2028\nstandardise these requirements.\u2028\nOur aid against Aids are in\u2028\nmaking marriage between young\u2028\npersons affordable and in\u2028\nstrengthening marriage and developing mutually supportive social\u2028\nkinships by reducing tension and strain.\u2028\nOur aids against Aids are in ensuring that the basic steps for marriage are known and facilitated in order to have orderly and strong marriage bonds.\u2028\n\u2022An Aids Education\u2028\nProgramme\u2028\nP.O.
