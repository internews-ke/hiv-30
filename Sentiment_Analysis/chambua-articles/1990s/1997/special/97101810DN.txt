{"text": "US allows new' Aids vaccine testing\nWASHINGTON. Friday\nThe US government has approved\nthe first human tests of a vaccine\nagainst the AIDS virus, researchers\nsaid today.\nMs Julia Hurwitz and Ms Karen\nSlobod of St Jude Children's Research\nHospital in Memphis, Tennessee\nsaid the US Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA) had given them the go-ahead to start safety\ntrials in human volunteers.\nThey said they would be recruiting\nbetween 9 and 18 healthy\nvolunteers for the Phase 1 clinical\ntrial, which focuses on safety\nalone and not on whether the vaccine\nworks.\nThe St. Jude vaccine uses part\nof the outer protein coating of the human immunodeficiency virus\n(HIV). The researchers are using\n23 different envelopes, each contained\nin a smallpox vaccine.\nThe idea is to trigger the body's\nimmune system so it will attack\nthe virus, without introducing any\ndangerous parts of the virus that\ncould become infectious.\n(Reuters)"}
