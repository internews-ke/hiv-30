{"text": "Aids awareness must be boosted\nPerhaps the best indicator that we still have a long way to go\nin the Aids awareness campaign is the fact that the World\nBank has granted the Government Sh2 billion for this effort.\nThat is a lot of money and an indication that the Bank appreciates\nthat Kenya has a lot of work to do before it can say the\nAids message has sunk.\nThere are many people who testify that Uganda's anti-Aids\ncampaign has been more aggressive, pervasive and sustained\nthan Kenya's. That the Ugandan Government has been more\nopen about the fact that many people have fallen to the disease\nand many more may follow if they do not change their\nlifestyles.\nKenyans who have visited Kampala have been struck by\nthe Aids awareness messages found all over the city. There\nare posters and billboards and adverts in the print and electronic\nmedia. It is as if the billboards and posters are competing\nfor attention. Can the same be said of Kenya?\nThe difference between Kenya and Uganda is one of degree,\nwith our neighbours staying clear ahead. Messages on\nAids, its dangers, that it is 100 per cent fatal, no cure exists\nand, therefore, safe sex or abstinence are vital, have been run\non public radio and television in Kenya. And, private media,\nparticularly radio, being the latest, have not been left behind\nin educating Kenyans on this scourge.\nIt is probably safe to argue that if more Kenyans are falling\nvictim to the Aids-causing HIV -virus, then they are to blame\nfor failing to heed the messages directed at them. Are there\nKenyans who still do not believe Aids exists and that it kills?\nAre there those who think that only people stalked by bad luck\ncontract Aids?\nIndications are that there are parts of the country where\nAids messages have not produced the desired effect. It would\nalso appear that the initial fear that gripped many Kenyans\nand spread faster than the disease has waned to be replaced\nwith complacency.\nThese, we think, are the areas and tendencies that need to\nbe targeted in the new drive to be paid for with the World\nBank grant. In some cases, the areas in question may be rural\nand some of the tendencies could arise from outdated cultural\nbeliefs or a suicidal, devil-may-care attitude. These must be\n, fought now."}
