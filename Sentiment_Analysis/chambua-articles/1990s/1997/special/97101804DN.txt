{"text": "Aids: Wonder drug failure 50 per cent\nBy DANIEL Q. HANEY.\nTORONTO. Wednesday\nWidely heralded new Aids treatments\nthat seemed to stop the virus cold and\nrevive patients from near death are\nnow beginning to fail in about half of\nall those treated, doctors said on Monday.\nThe disappointing reports suggest\nthat the tough virus is coming back after\nbeing knocked briefly into submission,\njust as many experts feared it\nwould.\n\"Over the past year, we had a honeymoon\nperiod,\" said Dr. Steven\nDeeks. \"The epidemic will likely split\nin two, and for half the people, we will\nneed new therapeutic options. \"\nDeeks presented data from the University of California at San Francisco's\nlarge public Aids clinic at San Francisco\nGeneral Hospital.\nPrescriptions of so-called three-drug\ncocktails - two older Aids drugs plus\none of the new class of medicines\ncalled protease inhibitors have\nclearly revolutionized Aids care. In\nmany places, more than 90 per cent of\nAids patients are taking these combinations,\nand typically people start on\nthem as soon as they learn they are infected,\neven before they get sick.\nPatients whose disease-fighting T\ncells were ravaged by HIV have gotten\nout of bed, regained normal lives and\neven gone back to work. However,\nmany worried from the start that the virus\nwould eventually grow resistant to the protease inhibitors and resume its\ninsidious destruction.\nThe latest data, presented on Monday\nat an infectious disease conference\nsponsored by the American Society of\nMicrobiology, suggests this is indeed\nhappening regularly.\nDeeks and colleagues reviewed the\nrecords of 136 HIV-infected people\nwho started on protease inhibitors in\nMarch 1996, when Crixivan and Norvir,\nthe first two powerful protease inhibitors,\ncame on the market.\nMost patients responded dramatically.\nTheir virus levels dropped so low\nthey could not be found on standard\ntests. But since then, the virus has returned\nto detectable levels in 53 per cent Although this is ominous, no one\nknows exactly what it means.\n\"All of our failures are clinically\nfeeling very well,\" said Deeks. 'It's\n.very important to understand we have\nno idea of the prognosis of people who\nhave resistant virus. \"\nDeeks said other large Aids clinics\nare having similar experiences, although\nhis is the first to present the\ndata publicly.\n\"There is a whole mixture of explanations\"\nfor the failures, said Dr. David\nHo of the Aaron Diamond Aids Research\nCenter in New York City.\n\"Compliance is absolutely critical,\n\" Deeks said. \"When we say compliance,\nwe mean rigid adherence to over\n20 pills a day.\" (AP)"}
