{"text": "Overhaul health statutes DMS\n\nBy JEFF OTIENO\nMost legislation governing health provisions in Kenya is archaic and\nrequires changes to correspond to the dynamic health sector, the Director of Medical Services said yesterday. \nDr James Mwanzia said there were about 30 such laws in need of an overhaul. \"Some of the legislation on drugs, health services can be traced back to the colonial days, \" he said.\nHe said only amendments had taken place but these were inadequate\nin the current health sector. The Medical Services boss said there were plans to invite a team of lawyers to liaise with the Ministry of Health in reviewing the legislation to come up with appropriate recommendations.\nMost of the review, he said, will be done at the Ministry of Health\nheadquarters.\nHe was speaking during the opening ceremony of a two-day\nTB/HIV /Aids Integration Workshop at the Pan Afric Hotel, Nairobi.\nKenya, the Director said, was at the initial stages of implementing the health sector reforms to include reorganisation and the restructuring\nof the Health Ministry. \n\"The restructuring at the central level has resulted in the creation of six key departments out of the previous 36, \" he said.\nDr Mwanzia said health sector reforms in Kenya were in line with Kenya's Health Policy Framework of November 1994.\nThe public health sector should not cater for those who can pay for the services elsewhere but rather for the poor, whose numbers,\nsaid, were increasing day by day\nUnder the health reforms hospitals would be given more autonomy in the provision of medic services and spending of funds.\nResults of a recent research indicated there was a strong link between tuberculosis and Aids, he said, adding that the increase in TB was mainly in the 15-39 age group as was the case in HIV trends.\nThe regional World Health Organisation Representative,\nPaul Chuke, said in a speech presented on his behalf by a WHO\nofficial that Aids and tuberculosis were among the classical new and\nreemerging communicable diseases challenging every country in the world today.\n\nWorld Health Organization Disease Control Officer Dr D.
