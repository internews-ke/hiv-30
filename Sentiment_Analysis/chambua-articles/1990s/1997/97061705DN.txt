This, he\nsaid, called for new measures to\nsave the situation from getting out\nof hand.\nThe workshop was told that the\nthreat has been contained largely\ndue to the implementation of a\nspecial programme, named the\nControl of Tuberculosis and Leprosy,\nthrough which TB out-patients\nreceive treatment at their local\nhealth centres.\nIn his speech, the PC said the\nprovincial administration and\nchiefs, especially, would be fully\ninvolved in creating Aids awareness\nin society ."}
