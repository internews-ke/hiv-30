{"text": "New Aids drug in trouble\nCHRIS ERASMUS,\nNATION Correspondent,\nCAPE TOWN. Thul'6day\nThe efficacy of a new South African\ndrug said to be effective\nagainst Aids has been put in doubt\nfollowing scrutiny by a probe\nteam.\nSouth African researchers had\nrecently reported that the drug,\nVirodene P058, had shown great\nefficacy in inhibiting the Human\nImmunodeficiency Virus.\nBut yesterday, a Pretoria University\nand Gauteng (greater Johannesburg)\nHealth Department\ncommittee probing the methods\nused by three researchers said\nthere was no evidence to back the\nresearchers claims.\nIn its report, the joint committee\nsaid the researchers had contravened\naccepted scientific procedures\nwhen testing the drug on\n11 patients. \u00b7\nThe researchers had tested the\ndrug, which comprised the toxic\nindustrial solvent, DMF, on Aids patients without sufficient scientific\nevidence that DMF would inhibit\nHIV.\n\"No animal trials were carried\nout which would normally be required\nto determine the anti-retrovirus\nefficacy of DMF,\" the report\nsaid.\nThe committee said it felt that\nhuman Aids trials should have\nbeen based on more substantial\nscientific evidence.\nThe report also said results of\npre-clinical tests by the researchers\non HIV-infected tissue culture\ncells had been inconclusive.\n\"The researchers nevertheless\nmaintained that there was, at the\nstart of the trial, well documented\nevidence for the anti-viral action\nof DMF.\"\nThis could not be substantiated\nby the committee after it studied\nliterature ,quoted by the researchers.\n\"None of the published reports\nindicated or suggested that DMF\ncould be described as an anti-protaese (agent).\n, 'There were no reports on\nDMF inhibition of HIV and only\none publication indicated that a\nvery high concentration of DMF\ncould cause a partial inhibition of\nthe human herpes virus. This virus\nis not related to HIV. ' ,\nThe researchers then exposed\nAids patients to DMF without permission\nfrom the Medicines Control\nCouncilor the Pretoria University's\nEthics and Research\nProtocol Committee.\nThe committee said many problems\nseemed to have arisen from\n\"scientific ignorance and naivety\"\nrather than intent.\nResearcher Olga Visser and\nPretoria University cardio-thoracic\nsurgeons Prof Dirk du Plessis\nand Dr Callie Landauer last month\nasked the Mandela Cabinet for\nR3.7 million (about US$800,000)\nfor research into Virodene. They\nsaid preliminary patient trails suggested\na possible breakthrough in\nthe fight against Aids."}
