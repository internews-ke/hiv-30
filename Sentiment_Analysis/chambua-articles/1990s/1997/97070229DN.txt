{"text": "JULY 2, 1997\n\n\nFirms, economy\u2028\nstart smarting\u2028\nfrom Aids costs\u2028\nA seminar held recently in\u2028\nKisumu to discuss the socio-economic impact of Aids in the province was an eye-opener. The revelations which were made by the\u2028\nDistrict Commissioners, parastatal heads, district officers and provincial departmental heads al the\u2028\nworkshop can help to galvanise\u2028\naction from a number of quarters to control the rapid spread of the\u2028\ndisease.\u2028\n. The local deputy director of\u2028\neducation. Mrs Roncline Oisyuka,\u2028\ntold participants that the number\u2028\nof teachers succumbing to the\u2028\npandemic was growing, and that\u2028\nthe effect may soon start to show\u2028\nin the education sector.\u2028\nThe managing director of the\u2028\nMuhoroni Sugar Company, Mr\u2028\nEnos Wanga, said that Aids had\u2028\nkilled 110 permanent employees\u2028\nof the firm since 1990, and that the\u2028\norganisation had spent Sh 7 million in the past seven years on\u2028\nAids-related contingencies.\u2028\nThe two officials revelations\u2028\nmirror the magnitude of damage\u2028\nthat Aids has done to Kenya\u2019s socio-economic sphere. The meeting also signified the increasing\u2028\nconcern the pandemic is raising\u2028\namong policy makers.\u2028\nCoincidentally, the United\u2028\nNations Programme on Aids held\u2028\na three-day seminar in Harare,\u2028\nZimbabwe, to discuss the grim\u2028\neconomic impact of HIV-Aids\u2028\nand explore the most appropriate \u2028\nresponse by the business sector.\u2028\nIn Kenya, surveys have found\u2028\nthat Aids is costing companies\u2028\nnearly four per cent of annual\u2028\nprofits. One of them conducted\u2028\nunder the Aidscap project by\u2028\nFamily Health International indicated that HIV/Aids poses and indirect risk to production and productivity.\u2028\nA report titled \u201cAids in Kenya:\u2028\nSocioeconomic impact and policy\u2028\nimplications\u201d estimates that one\u2028\n\u2018in seven workers in Nairobi is infected with HIV/Aids and projects\u2028\nthat one in four workers will be infected by the year 2000.\u2028\n\u201cInterviews with managers of\u2028\nvarious businesses revealed that\u2028\nalmost all managers know of at\u2028\nleast one of their employees who\u2028\nhad died of Aids and of others\u2028\nwho arc currently infected.\u201d the\u2028\nreport says.\u2028\nThe survey research that firms\u2028\ncould incise overhead expenditure\u2028\nin staff health care. burial coasts,\u2028\nand recruitments to replace Aids\u2028\nvictims. Production is also expected to decrease in companies\u2028\ndue to increased absenteeism rebled to HIV infections, Aids and\u2028\nfuneral attendance by co-workers,\u2028\nand the time required Lo hire new employers.\u2028\nA financial analysis for the\u2028\nfirms in focus indicates that if the\u2028\nAids problem persists, it will substantially increase the cost of\u2028\nlabour, \u201cProjections for the year\u2028\n2005 indicate that the additional\u2028\ncost of Aids may increase labour\u2028\ncosts by four per cent For some\u2028\ncompanies this could rise to eight\u2028\nper cent.\u201d\u2028\nAt a wider spectrum, with Aids\u2028\ninfection rates reach as high as\u2028\n20 to 30 per cent of adult in some\u2028\nparts of Kenya, it is apparent that\u2028\nthe disease will have a profound\u2028\nimpact on the national economy.\u2028\nalthough it is difficult to quantity\u2028\nthe impact with precision.\u2028\n\u201cBy the year 2005, the economic simulations suggest that\u2028\nKenya\u2019s Gross Domestic Product\u2028\n(GPD) will he 14.5 per cent smaller than it otherwise would have\u2028\nbeen had Aids never occurred. Per\u2028\ncapita income is projected to be\u2028\nreduced by 10 per cent....\u201d\u2028\nKenya\u2019s National Development Plan calls upon the private\u2028\nsector lo play a greater role in\u2028\nAids prevention by supplant\u2028\nworkplace prevention efforts an\u2028\nestablishing appropriate policies\u2028\nfor die work place. However, the\u2028\nGovernment has only recommended that business adopt\u2028\nWHO and ILO policies on Aids\u2028\nbut has not put in place a machinery to gauge the rate and Level of\u2028\ncompliance.\u2028\nThe Aidscap document, prepared with funding from the US\u2028\nAgency for International Development, recommends that business establishments adopt (some have already done it Aids work\u2028\nplace prevention programmes, lo\u2028\nhe established within a framework\u2028\nacceptable to both the workers\u2028\nand the management. The Government\u2019s role here should be to\u2028\ndevelop legal or regulatory guide\u2028\nlines for the business sector\u2028\nThe recommended workplace\u2028\nprogrammes include packages involving personalised education\u2028\nsessions. TD diagnosis and treatment, condom distribution, con-\u2028\nselling and support services. Man\u2028\nagers should shun emotions when\u2028\nhandling Aids-related problems\u2028\naffecting their staff or prospective\u2028\nemployers For instance, some\u2028\ncompanies are, known so coerce\u2028\nworkers to he diagnosed for Aids\u2028\nand making a HIV/Aids-free certificate as s prerequisite for recruitment this  has, to a large degree, proved to be retrogressive.\u2028\nLocal companies should, therefore assess the current and the potential impact of Aids on their operations and profitability. The\u2028\noutcome of such a synopsis will.\u2028\nmost likely, make a government\u2028\nbusiness labour dialogue necessary\u201d. This tripartite liaison will\u2028\nclarify the expected responses to\u2028\nthe epidemic from each side.\u2028\nIn die meantime. as Aids eats\u2028\ninto the educations sector in\u2028\nNyanza. more seminars such as\u2028\nthe one that took place in Kisumu\u2028\nare to be encouraged Much more\u2028\nstill remains unknown of the impact of the pandemic on other sectors of the economy.\u2028"}
