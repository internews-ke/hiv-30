{"text": "THURSDAY, OCTOBER 16, 1997\n\nCommunity move cuts treatment costs for HIV victims\nOpportunistic infections are a major cause of\u2028\ndiscomfort for people living with HIV.\u2028\nFor the poor which constitute more than half\u2028\nof the Kenyan population, the cost of treating\u2028\nthese infections in regular healthcare institutions is prohibitive.\u2028\nHowever, health care can affordably be provided at the community level] as the Archdiocese of Nairobi Eastern Deanery CBHC Aids\u2028\nRelief Programme is proving by providing\u2028\nhome care within the slums and estates.\u2028\nThis programme is carried out by volunteer\u2028\nhealth workers chosen by their communities,\u2028\nwho are trained and returned to their communities to care for their own people.\u2028\nThe health workers are supported in their\n\ncare of patients by a nurse in each location who\u2028\nis consulted on a regular basis and updated on\u2028\nthe status of the various patients attended to by\u2028\nthe health workers.\u2028\nTotal volunteer health workers involved in\u2028\nthis programme are 340 who service an area\u2028\nwith an estimated population of 500,000\u2028\npeople.\u2028\nThe services provided by the health workers\u2028\ninclude diagnosis of conditions which are followed up with testing and treatment at the\u2028\ncentre, if needed, or are addressed directly \u00a1n\u2028\nthe home.\u2028\nCounselling on self care, Aids and\u2028\nbehaviour change are also provided as is psychological support and sociological care. All\n\npatients, once identified, are provided with continuous care at home, with follow up to ensure\u2028\nthat they are maintaining their course of treatment. .\u2028\nThe patients are not only cared for until death\u2028\nbut efforts are also made to ensure that arrangements are made for surviving children, in the case of single parents.\u2028\nThrough this programme, it has been ob\u2028\nserved that the main problem facing HJV/Aids\u2028\npatients are diarrhoea, chest infection and re\u2028\ncurrent skin infection due to staphylococcus\u2028\naureus, a bacteria that resides on the skin.\u2028\nThe proper use of broad spectrum antiseptics\u2028\nsuch as Savion and disinfectants such as Presept can greatly help avoid the spread of dangerous bacteria and virus that lead to infection\u2028\nof either patient or health worker.\u2028\nThe use of these preventive measures to enhance hygiene is also cheaper than the cost of\u2028\ntreating the infections with antibiotics or steroids which in some cases have been rendered ineffective due to resistance of micro-organisms to treatment.\u2028\nThe Nairobi Eastern Deanery CBI-IC and\u2028\nAids Relief Programme is able to carry out its\u2028\nwork as a result of donations from parishes in\u2028\nthe Eastern slum areas among others.\u2028\nLast Wednesday, Johnson & Johnson\u2028\n(Kenya) Ltd. presented the programme with\u2028\nmaterials for the healthcare workers that included medication valued at over Sh250,000."}
