{"text": "Aids crisis complicates group cover policies\nMost \u00b7people rely almost exclusively\nupon current earnings for\ntheir maintenance and that of\ntheir families. Therefore, any\ncontingency which may cut off\nthe current flow of earnings presents\na serious economic\nproblem.\nThree major contingencies are .\ncommon to all: retirement, premature\ndeath and disability: No\none can escape all three.\nSince retirement comes at the\nend of a working career, it is relatively predictable and there is\nusually time to provide for it.\nOver the past few weeks, we have\naddressed the subject of retirement\nbenefits. It will be recalled\nthat we talked of these benefits as\nbeing available either in a lump\nsum at retire merit, or annuity\n(pension) payments throughout\nthe annuitant's lifetime. Alternatively,\nthe superannuation benefits\ncould be a combination of a\nlump sum and annuity. The benefit\ndepends on the type of arrangement\nprovided under the\nparticular retirement scheme.\nThe occurrence of death is\ngenerally unpredictable'. Whilst\nthis is so, the economic loss to the\nfamily occasioned by the death of\n. the breadwinner can have grave\nconsequences. To a conscientious\nemployer,. it is heart rending\nto see the family of a deceased\nemployee now suffering an economic\nhardship - maybe the\nwidow and children are starving,\ndressed in near rags, or are having incessant school fees problems\n- and, generally, living in\nunaccustomed\u00b7 misery. It is precisely\nfor this reason, that many\nemployers provide in-service\ndeath benefits. Usually, these are\narranged alongside a retirement\nbenefits scheme, but not necessarily\nso. Also, in most cases, in-service death benefits are provided\nthrough group life assurance\narrangement with an insurance\ncompany.\nGroup Life Assurance will be\nour subject today. But just before\nwe talk about GLA, a comment\nshould.- be made about the third\ncontingency mentioned above,\nthat is, disability. The onset of a\ndisabling illness or accident\u00b7 is\nalso as unpredictable as premature\ndeath. But it is even more\nlikely to occur during a person's\nworking career than death. Disability\nfor an extended period\nmay cause even more economic.\nhardship to an employee's family\nthan his death.\n. This is because his own living\nexpenses continue during his disability\n\u00b7, as well as those of his\nfamily. In addition, there may be\ncosts of medical treatment. and\nrehabilitation. Today in Kenya,\nmedical expenses alone can be financially\ncrippling, and the medical\nexpenses benefit may very\nwell be by far the most important\nof employee benefits that an employer\ncan provide. We shall be\nlooking into the subject of medical\ninsurance in later articles.\nFor now, let us turn our attention\nto group life assurance.\nGroup insurance, as the name implies,\nis distinguished from other\n. forms of personal (or individual)\ninsurance in that several members\nof a group, such as employees\nof a company, are insured under\none master policy. In group\ninsurance, the underwriting unit\nis the group and not each individual in the group. Therefore, selection\nand premium rating are\nbased on the group as a whole,\nand the master policy is issued to\nthe group. The individuals insured\nunder the policy are themselves\n\u00b7 not contracting parties.\nHowever, they may be issued\nwith certificates of participation\nand booklets describing the cover included in the master policy.\nAnother characteristic of\ngroup insurance is that it is essentially\nlow cost, mass protection.\nThrough mass distributing and\nmass administration, economies\nof large volume operation are obtained.\nThen, the contract which\nis legally between the insurance\ncompany and the group policyholder\n(most commonly an employer),\nmay last long beyond the\nlifetime, or membership in the\nplan, of anyone individual. New\npersons\u00b7 are added to the group\nfrom time to time and others terminate their cover.\nGLA can be effected to cover\nemployees of a single employer\nor multiple employer groups,\ndebtors of a common creditor\nsuch as a bank or saving and\ncredit co-operative, or other\ngroups with some common bond\napart from ate purpose of obtaining\ninsurance. In the case of employer\nemployee groups, GLA is\nused mainly to provide in-service\ndeath benefits and the cover is related to an .employee's salary. Death cover may be 24, 36'or\neven 60 months' salary. When arranged\nas a separate plan from\nthe . superannuation benefits\nscheme, it is usually a group term\nassurance policy and is, therefore,\nobtainable at a low-cost. As\na result, the employer would normally\nbear all the cost without requiring\nemployee contributions.\nCover is generally provided\nonly while the member is in the\nemployer's service, terminating\non his retirement or cessation of\nservice. An employee who leaves\nthe employer's service before reaching his normal retirement\ndate has the option of continuing\nthe cover as an individual .policy\nof his choice at the tabular premiums\napplicable to his then attained\nage without evidence of\nhealth.\nAn important feature of a GLA\nplan is that most of the insurance\ncompanies are prepared to offer a\nsubstantial amount of cover without\nevidence of health. This\nbenefit is known as the \"Free\"\nLife Cover and is the level of\nbenefit that is provided before a\nmedical examination of an employee\nis required. It varies from\nscheme to scheme and is dependent\non certain conditions being\nfulfilled. Amongst the conditions,\nan employer must ensure\nthat there is a stated minimum\npercentage (usually, 75 per cent)\nof those employees eligible to\n'join the scheme at its inception.\nEligibility and benefits are fixed\nand should not involve selection\nagainst the insurer. Moreover;\nmembership is compulsory for\neligible employees joining the\nemployer's service after\u00b7 inception\nof the plan ..\nIn setting the Free Life Cover\nlimit, an insurance company\ntakes into account the number of\nlives involved in the whole group\nand the average sum assured.\nThis is to ensure that the insurer\nhas a reasonable spread of risk.\nSome schemes have free cover limits of up to Shl.5 million\nmeaning that a. member whose\nsum assured falls within this limit\ncan enjoy his full cover without\nevidence of health. It is to be noted\nthat such evidence is only required\nto respect of any excess\nsum assured. Even if an employee\nis found to be completed' uninsurable\nfor the excess sum assured,\nhe will be entitled to cover\nup to the limit granted without\nevidence, and at normal premium\nrates ..\nThere can be crisis arising\nfrom a difference between an insurer's\nFree Cover Limit and its\nthreshold for HIV testing. Most\ninsurance companies require the\nlife assured to submit to this special\ntest once the sum assured exceeds\na certain fixed minimum\nwhich may be well below the free\ncover limit. This may conflict\nwith the plan's arrangement ..\nFurthermore, unless a caveat\nwas included in the employee announcement,\nor incorporated the\u00b7\nemployment contract, an employee\ncould refuse to be medically\nexamined in which ca1e an\nemployer is still liable to provide\nthe full benefit as per the contract\nof employment. After all, the employee\nis not a party to the group\nlife assurance policy. This is the\ndilemma being faced by some\nemployers and their insurers, especially\nin regard to the test for\nthe Aids scourge.\nThis situation leads to selection\nagainst the insurer - all untenable\nposition as it violates one\nof the cardinal principles of\ngroup underwriting. The problem\nneeds resolving - and, soon.\n(The writer is a Risk Management\nand Insurance Management\nConsultant with Ng'aru &\nAssociates)"}
