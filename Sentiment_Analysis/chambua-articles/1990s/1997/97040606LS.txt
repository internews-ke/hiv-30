{"text": "'Broken water' linked to Aids\nA study suggests that if too much time elapses between the release of amniotic fluid and the birth of a child in a woman infected with HIV, the baby risks becoming infected with the virus that causes Aids. Dr Sheldon Handesman of the State University of New York Health Science Centre at Brooklyn and his colleagues found that the risk of contracting HIV - human immunodeficiency virus - nearly doubles if birth occurs more than four hours after the protective sheath of amniotic fluid has ruptured. The findings published in New England Journal of Medicine may discourage doctors from intentionally breaking the sheath to speed labour or to place an electrode on the baby's scalp to monitor the infant. The research, an analysis of 525 births from women infected with HIV, found that the longer the baby remained unsheathed in the womb, the greater the risk of virus transmission."}
