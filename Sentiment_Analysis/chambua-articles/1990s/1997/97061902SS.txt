{"text": "Puberty rites\nIn a recent symposium on Aids, a\nsecondary school head teacher\nasked if the circumcision of boys\ncould be delayed until after they\ncompleted school. Reason: Both\nboys and the girls take puberty\nrites as a licence to become sexually\nactive to the detriment of their\nstudies.\nThe young men are driven by\nthe African cultural belief that the\nmale is entitled to have sex with as\nmany women as possible and the\ngirls oblige.\nResearch has shown that, on the\naverage the African male has\nabout four times as many sexual\npartners as the European male.\nOur youth is growing up in this\ncultural set-up and without adequate guidance from society.\nThey therefore do what they have\nobserved, namely drink and become promiscuous.\n***\nOur aids against Aids are in\nknowing that some of our own traditional\npractices are misleading\nthe youth into promiscuity and\ndangerous sex.\n***\nMale circumcision is not regarded\nas a mutilation and thus subject to\ncondemnation but female circumcision\nis.\n'There are three main types of\nfemale genital operations: the\ngenital stitch, genital pull and\ngenital cut and all three are practised\nin Kenya and other parts of\nAfrica. The cut and stitch are are\nconsidered to be a mutilation.\nThe cut involves the excision of\nparts of the clitoris and the inner\nlips of the vulva.\nIn view of the promiscuity that\nfollows, it is evident that this operation\nno longer serves the intended\npurpose. Promiscuity is responsible\nfor a lot of the spread of\nAids ..\nThe stitch involves scraping the\nouter lips of the vulva and getting\nthem stuck together lightly so as\nto cover most of the vulva but\nleaving a small hole over the vaginal\nopening to allow menstruation\nand urine to flow out.\nThis condition is supposed to\npersist until the girl gets married\nwhen the husband opens the\nstitched parts.\nDespite the stiching, some girls\nbecome sexually active and so the\noperation does not fulfilI the intended\npurpose.\nGenital pull is aimed at heightening\nthe sensitiveness of. the female\ngenitals by pulling out the\nsmaller inner and sensitive lips of\nthe female so as to make her much\nmore sexually sensitive.\nThis practice is responsible for\na lot of adolescent promiscuity\nwhich has in turn promoted very\nrapid spread of Aids. -\nMany communities have gone\nto great lenghts to keep the\npractice alive i.e. circumcising\ngirls when they are babies. Puberty rites have been practiced\nas the physical preparation\nof adolescents for marriage and\nreproduction.\nToday, education prolongs the\nperiod between the rites and\nmarriage.\nHowever, the form, and religious\neducation that have effectively\nphased out female circumcision\nhave not provided effective\npreparation on adolescent development\nand courtship relationships.\nThe vaccum created has been\nfilled up by sexual liberalisation.\nFor example, there is no longer\nany sense of guilt, in some girls, in\ngoing into prostitution to earn a\nliving. This is a time bomb and\nAids is the fuse which is burning\nfast to explode it.\nThe biggest problem today is\nnot the physical operation or not\nunder going circumcision but the\nlack of effective and value added\neducation on adolescent development and courtship relationships\nto replace the values on reproduction\nfor which the puberty rites\nhave been the physical and outward\nsign.\nIt is also the extensive promiscuity\nthat follows these operations\nthat has proved to be important.\nLack of education on adolescence\nand courtship has resulted\nin endless arguments. Fortunately, the parents are now demanding\nto be educated on adolescent development\nso that they can guide\ntheir sons and daughters more effectively.\nOur aids against Aids are in\nenabling parents to effectively\nprepare their sons and\ndaughters on adolescent development\nand courtship values\nand ethics.\nAn aids Education Programme, P.O: Box 72454,\nNairobi.\nMale circumcision which involves the removal of the foreskin to expose the tip of the penis is not regarded as genital  mutilation. - (File picture)\n\nCairo pledges not met\nBy PAUL REDFERN.\nNATION Correspondent. in London\nThe world's industrialised nations have not lived up to the promises they made at the Cairo Conference on Population and Development three years ago according to the 1997 State of the World Population report released recently.\nWhile many poor developing countries have taken urgent steps to take action on reproductive health, population growth, the spread of HIV infection, education and family planning, the annual global expenditures on the programme of action agreed at Cairo is only half the estimated total of $17 billion which will be required by the year 2000.\nThe United Nations Population Fund which issued the report says that birth rates across East Africa have fallen in recent years, in Kenya, quite dramatically to only 2.2 per cent.\nHowever, population levels are still expected to reach 50.2 million in Kenya by 2025 with Uganda's level estimated to be 45 million and Tanzania's a staggering 62.4 million.\nThe report says that the 'problems that face the poor inc1ude.\nA high number of women - 585,000 women- who died each year from pregnancy related problems.  Many more more suffer temporary or permanent disability as the result of childbirth.\nMany of these deaths could be easily prevented by low-cost improvements in reproductive health care such as better monitoring and care during pregnancy. Between 120 and 150 million women still do not have access to adequate family planning. Around 70,000 women each year die as a result of unsafe abortions.\n120 million women have undergone female genital mutilation known as circumcision despite the fact that it has been condemned by the international community.\nThe practice is still widespread in 28 countries including Kenya and Uganda. Rape and other forms of sexual violence against women are reported to be on the increase.\nTwo million girls - aged between five and 15 years \u2013 are forced into the sex market each year as a result of poverty."}
