{"text": "Why pick poor states as\nsite for Aids vaccine test?\nThe search for an Aids cure continues. However, in the\nmeantime, researchers are getting ready to embark on trials\nof Aids vaccines in selected countries beginning early next\nyear. This new development, although not a cure in itself, is\nviewed as generally good news but opponents are not happy\nthat the sampled countries are in the developing region. Why\nthe Third World! they ask. DAVID ONECHANA reports.\nAt the beginning of 1994, sc1entists\nand researchers will move a\nstep ahead in trying to tame the\nkiller disease; Acquired Immune\nDeficiency Syndrome (AIDS).\n\u00b7 The first large scale trials of Aids\nVaccines will begin in selected developing\ncountries. Already, a\n\u00b7 joint project between the United\nStates army and the Thai government is underway and at the start\nof the new year, one of the 15\n\u00b7 candidate vaccines in the market\nwill be tested on Thai military\nrecruits.\nAccording to. Panos AIDS\nBriefing (No.2), produced by\nthe London-based independent\ninformation organisation\n\u00b7 PANOS, the World Health\nOrganisation (WHO) is also\nworking with four developing\ncountries, and the US National\n\u00b7 Institute of Allergy and Infectious\nDiseases (NIAID) with\neight developing countries, to\n\u00b7create the infrastructure for large\nscale Aids vaccine tests. Countries\nchosen for the WHO trials\nare Uganda ,Rwanda, Brazil and\u00b7\nThailand while those chosen by\nNIAID are Haiti, Zimbabwe,\nUganda, Malawi, Rwanda,\n\u00b7Kenya, India and Thailand.\nBriefing on latest developments\non Aids, the publication\nexplains that an effective Aids\n\u00b7 vaccine is meant to protect\nagainst the Human Immunodeficiency Virus(\nHIV),the virus that\ncauses Aids, in uninfected individuals ,prevent disease progression in HIV positive individuals,\nreduce transmission of HIV, and\n\u00b7prevent prenatal (mother-to-\u00b7\nchild) transmission.\nShould these vaccination\nprojects prove successful, then\n\u00b7this would offer some hope since\nthis fairly new disease being suffered by\nmillions of people worldwide\nwould at least be brought\nunder control With a real cure\n..for Aids still being sought.the\nVaccination would protect those\nwho are not yet infected.\nHowever, cynics have posed a\nnumber of questions in view of\nthe programmes which have the\nblessings of the world health\nbody.\nWhy has the developing world\nbeen chosen for these experiments?\nWhat are the risks involved?\nThe benefits? Above all,\nwill it be a fair trial?\n\"When we help scientists in\nRwanda, Uganda, Thailand and\nBrazil develop plans for vaccine\n\u00b7evaluation ,the first question is,\n'why us?',\" says Jose Esparza,\nhead of vaccine development at\nWHO's Global Programme OD Aids.\nEsparza argues that the developing\nWorld \u00b7needs the vaccine\n\u00b7 more than the developed world because most of the \u00b7poor countries\nare experiencing an intolerable\neconomic burden because of\nthe Aids pandemic .He is of the\nopinion that one of the reasons\nwhy the drogs would be tested in\nthe developing world is to ensure\nthat the same work locally since\nmedicine in Europe or America\nmay not necessarily be effective\nin Third World countries.\n, He is supported by Dr Bruce\nForrest, director of clinical development at\nthe United Biomedical\nwho says: \"Not doing something\nin the developing world and just\nfocusing on Europe and North\nAmerica poses ethical questions\nas well.\"\nThese views are shared by scientific\nand epidemiological arguments\nwhich say that the developing\nworld is a suitable testing\nground for Aids vaccines. They\nargue that the developing world\nhas a high rate of infection (3-5\nnew infections per 100 people)_\nthus ~if tying as an ideal place\nwhere scale test a can be carried\nout. This means that smaller\nsample sizes will be required for a\nshorter period of time and in the\nprocess, reduce costs in these\ntrials.\nReseach\nOne analyst who explained the\ncost factor in the choice of conducting\nAids research in Africa\nsaid:\"The case of assembling the\nrequisite number of appropriate\nsubjects (and the relatively low\nwages) have been explicitly identified\nby some investigators as\nbenefits of conducting Aids re-\nII/l8lChin Africa.\"\nManuel Pinto, the Director-\nGeneral of the Uganda Aids\nCommission supports the idea by\nSaying that the developing world\nhas a chance to participate both\nas beneficiaries and scientific and\nresearch experts.\nWith such arguments supporting\nthe choice of the developing\nworld, the pertinent question is,\nare these trials going to be carried\nout in conformity to guidelines\non the ethics of medical research\ninvolving human subjects?\nAccording to the Nuremberg\nCode promulgated in 1947, there\nmust be protection of individuals\nparticipating in medical research with the main emphasis on \"voluntary\nconsent\".\nThe principles of the Nuremberg Code were reiterated in\nArticle\n7 of the International Covenant\non Civiland Political Rights\nformally adapted by the United\nNations in 1966. It states: \"No\none shall be subjected to torture\nor to cruel ,inhuman or degrading\ntreatment or punishment. In particular,\nno one shall be subjected\nwithout his free consent to medical\nor scientific\nexperimentation.\"\nThe first known Aids vaccine\ntrials in the. developing world\nwere those performed in Zaire by\nFrench scientist Dr Daniel\nZagury in 1986. In three separate\ntrials, Dr Zagury vaccinated 10\nchildren aged two and nine years,\neight children and youth aged between\n10 and 18, and around 30 .\nadult volunteers ,including members\nof Zaire's armed forces. But\nthere was an outcry in the country\nabout the vaccinations.\nIt was later learnt that neither\nthe children nor their parents or\nguardians knew what th e vaccination\nwas all about. Needlessto\nsay, the children in this case\ncould not have informed consent. _\nHelen Jackson, who runs an\nAids information network in\nZimbabwe, harbors some doubts\nabout the rigour with which informed consent\nwill be obtained.\n\"The safe guards do soimd good\nand proper, but in a field situation,\nwith pressure to recruit a\nlarge number of people, I wonder\nhow strictly guidelines Will be observed,\"\nshe argues.\n\"U you think of the contert in\nWhich people might be recruited\nfor Aids vaccine trials..- perhaps\nthe army in some countries, or\namong women coming to antenatal\nclinics- there is a question\nabout the extent to which people\nfeel able to say 'no',\" she adds.\nDavid Heyman of WHO's\nGlobal Programme on Aids is\nAware that for many people in the\nDeveloping world, \"better health\ncare, in itself, might be an induce mentor\ncoercion to participate\nin the trials.\"\nSome people have argued that\nInformed on sent can be obtained\nfrom community leaders but this\nis more of an obstacle as some\ncommunities, especially in Africa.\nare forbidden by their cultures to\ndiscuss  matters relating to sem-a1ity - the commonest W~f\ntransmitting Aids.\n\"Asian African ,I have seen situations\nwhere people have been\nused in trials of drogs and vaccines who have\ncertainly not benefited\nfrom the fruits of such a\nresearch,\" says l)ne doctor from\nUganda.\nOthers who doubt the genuineness\nof carrying out the vaccination\ntrials in the developing world\nlook at the whole process as a\n\"safari\" or \"hit end run\" research\nsince, if anything  goes wrong, a\nfollow-up is unlikely as long as\nthe victim scomll from the poorer\nworld.\nRobin GorD,a of Britain's\nNational Aid$ Manual believes\nthat testing Aids vaccines in developing\ncountries is essentially\nracist. \"Cynics might think that\none of the reasons why vaccine\ntrials are being run in the developing world is because black bodies\nare more dispensable than\nwhite bodies,\" says Goma.\"\nCommenting on the vaccine\ntrials, Mr Joe Muriuki, an Aids\nsufferer and founder of the Know\nAids Society in Kenya notes that\ndeveloping countries have very\nvulnerable economies which put\nthem at a disadvantage.\nMystery\nMr MuriukifUrtherarguesthat\nsince the vaccines are not well\nknownyet, theiireffectsremain a\nmystery.He IKIdsthat they may\nhave long-ternl negative effects\nwhichmight eventrigger further\nthe spread of HIV.\nThe Know Aids Society\nfounder is concerned that the\nWestcannot ril~ktrying suchvaccines\non their own people but\nwould rather use them on\ndefencelesspet>plein the Third\nWorld.\nBut Dr SylvesterFaya of the\n1\\2a Khan Hospital in Nairobi,\nwho is a1aoth.echairman of t ,.\nKnowAidsSo<::ietyw,elcomest _\nidea of carrying out the vaccine\ntesta in developingcountries.\nHepoints out that sinceAidsis\na world-wide:problem,it is only\nproper to carry out the proposed\ntrials in different environments\nwith differeIltt people so that\nmore conclusive results can be\nachieved.\nWhether the vaccination\nprojects will be successful and\nlead to the control of the spread\nof Aids in the developingworld\nremains to be seen, but it is\nworthwhilefornationalAidsbodies\nand Aids activists in the developingworld\nto look at these\nexperiments critically.
