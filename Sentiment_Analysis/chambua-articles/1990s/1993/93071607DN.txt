When you\ngo' for a general medical\ncheck-up, says our source, the\ncompany doctor pierces your\nskin and takes a blood sample.\nAsked why, the medicotypical\nanswer is: \"To know\nyour blood colour.\"\nWe thought it might have\nbeen a blood-grouping\ntest, But the certificate made\nit plain: among other things,\nthe client was being tested for\nHIV.
