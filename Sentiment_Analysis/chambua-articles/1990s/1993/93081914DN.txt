{"text": "August 19, 98\nAnti-Aids vaccine is still far away\nBy OTULA OWUOR\nNews from the World Health I\nOrganisation that there has been\nno breakthrough in the search for\nanti-Aids vaccine is a clear indicator\nthat the only weapon ..\nagajnst the killer disease is intensified\npublic education to curb its\nspread.\nExperts attending the Nigeria\nInternational Congress of Virology held in Glasgow, Britain, were\nlast week told that initial results\nof clinical tests using 15anti-Aids\nvaccines developed during the\nlast six years are disappointing.\nDr Michael Merson, the head\nQf Global Programme on Aids\nwhich is under the World Health\nOrganisation, last week said that\nthe level antibodies produced by\nsome of the vaccines were low,\nshort-lived and were only appropriate\nfor certain strains or types I\nof the Aids virus.\nIn short the vaccines, which\nare said to be safe, have not clearly\nproved to be useful in protecting\npeople against infection and\nthere is no tangible information\non their ability to delay the onset\nof Aids which is the terminal\nphase of the infection by Human\nImmunodeficiency Virus (HIV).\nThe failure of some of 'the\nhigh-tech genetically engineered\nvaccines considered ideal against\nthe HIV seem to have pushed experts,\nincluding those at WHO,\nback to what was considered as a\nsimplistic approach to anti-Aids\nvaccines.\nThe experts have decided to include in their research the development\nof a vaccine with live attenuated\nAids virus. According to\nGPA boss the candidate vaccines\nbeing produced also include synthetic\npeptides or protein\u00b7 subunits.\nAids prevention in developing\nnations requires up to $ 2.9 billion(shs.210 billion) and this\nmay reduce the rate of infection\nby 10 million.\nBy the year 2000 or in the next\nseven years a cumulative total of\n40 million people will have been infected by the lethal virus."}
