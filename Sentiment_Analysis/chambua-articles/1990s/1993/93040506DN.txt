{"text": "Medical 'conmen' out to dupe Africans over Aids\nBV OTULA OWUOR\n(Science Editor)\nOnce again some local and international\ngroups are out to provide,\nmisleading information on\nthe state of Aids in Africa.\nWithin the last three weeks the\nmedia has carried two major stories\nthat may easily result in even\nhigher rates of infection by the\nAids virus.\nIt would appear that there is a\nneed to protect Africa from biomedical\nexperts who still see the\ncontinent as a rich or ideal testing\nground for their half-baked or\nunfounded and ill-motivated\ntheories.\nMedics in Africa should effectively\nrefute the recently published\nmisleading information on\nthe status of Aids on the continent\nwhich is now being used to\n\"prove\" that the Aids virus is\nrather\" friendly\" and the disease\nis not spreading rapidly - meaning\nnot killing enough people - in\nAfrica and therefore people\nshould not be alarmed. The\nsecond story downplayed the importance\nof condoms in curbing\nthe' spread of the killer disease\nand even, said that the lethal\nAids-causing Human Immunodeficiency\nVirus (HIV) can pass\nthrough a condom's pores. Such\nclaims unnecessarily complicate\nthe Aids problem in Africa.\nEven before African doctors\ndetected cases of Aids, \u00b7many\nWestern researchers' were \"authoritatively\"\ntalking about millions\nof people \"deep inside ,the\ncontinent dying from the lethal\ninfection that had already spread\nlike the savannah grassland fire.\"\nThe lies that millions were already\ninfected with the HIV virus ,\na decade ago, is closely linked to\nthe theories that Aids originated\nin Africa. Thus between 1982 and\n1987 much of the energy and efforts\ndirected against the killer\ndisease were spent in refuting the\nunfounded suggestions that the\nvirus originated in Africa.\nSeveral top African medical experts,\nteeming up with\nsympathisers from the West, presented\ntheir data and information\nto prove that the virus was\ndeliberately introduced on the\ncontinent via a Central African\nnation after being \"manufactured\"\nin the laboratories of some\ndeveloped nations.\nIt 'was only after the World\nHealth Organisation (WHO)\nstepped in to remind the world\nthat although knowing the origins\nof the virus may be important,\nmedical experts were not\npaying attention to \"where the\ndisease was going.\"\nEven the editors of the British\nmedical journal, Lancet, tended\nto be carried away and did not hesitate to publish a paper saying\nthat the genes that made Africans\nmore susceptible to Aids\nhad been identified.\nNeedless to 'say, there was a\nretraction later when the author\nclaimed he had been misled by\nfaulty biomedical devices.\nThe killer disease was being\nportrayed as belonging to certain\npeople. Yet its spread overwhelmingly\ndepends on high risk\nbehaviours including unprotected\nand indiscriminate sex or having\na multiplicity of sexual relationships\nor using unsterilised needles,\nsyringes and other skin\npiercing devices.\nIn the last four years, Africans\n- even the illiterate - are fast\nrealising that Aids is indeed an\nincurable disease which kills its\nvictims within four to five years.\nAfricans, more than any other\ngroup, already know the tragic\nsocio-economic impact associated\nwith Aids as parents have died\nand left behind orphans who are '\nnow estimated to reach :-120,000\nin Kenya alone in the next two\n, years.\nUnforgivable\nIt is therefore evil and unforgivable\nthat more Africans will '\ndie because a major British television\nstation after a short stint\nin Uganda is spreading news that\nHIV virus is \"actually harmless\"\nas theorised by a US professor,\nPeter Duesberg, and his protege\nDr H. Bialy., . ,\n, The \"proof' that the virus is\n\"harmless\" is linked to their false\nobservation that Africa is not in\nthe middle of an Aids epidemic\nbecause not \"enough\" of them are\nsick or dying even in Aids-devastated\ncountries such as Uganda.\nBarely a decade ago other\nforeign \"experts\" were busy\nmounting the highest of rooftops\nand shouting that millions of\npeople in Africa were already being\nkilled by the Aids virus while\nlocal health experts could only\ncount less than 100 people.\nToday when Africans are saying\nthe new disease is spreading\nrapidly and threatening the survival\nof the continent, a new\nbatch of foreign biomedical\nconmen are busy shouting that\nthere is no Aids epidemic on the\ncontinent and this proves their\ntheory that HIV is \"generally a\nharmless by-stander.\"What crap!\nThe false claims may appeal to\nthose who still do not want to\nbelieve that the HIV virus has hit\nmankind \"below the belt.\" In a\nworld of spontaneity it may not\nbe easy to acquire the simple protective\nhabits against the lethal\ninfection.\nProfessor Duesberg and his team of \"pseudo-experts\" should\nleave Africa alone. Their selfish\ncampaigns, if unchecked by may\nfinally result in the deaths of millions.\nAlready in Kenya at least\n30 per cent of the beds in some\nhospital wards, including Kenyatta\nNational Hospital, are occupied\nby Aids patients.\nLocal experts say ,that they\nnowadays monitor the sensitivity\nof various tests used to detect the\nHIV virus and the accuracy is\nvery high unlike seven years ago.\nThus in Kenya a million people\nwho carry the virus will finally\nsuccumb to Aids in this decade.\nThe Director of the World\nHealth Organisation's Global\nProgramme on AIDS, Dr Michael\nMerson last month said in London\nthat debates whether HIV\nreally causes AIDS is pointless\nand feeds the \"denial complacency\nthat has hampered global control\nefforts.\"\nDr Davy Koech, the Director of\nthe Kenya Medical Research Institute\nsaid that \"these people are\nbasically tourists and have no\nconcern on the negative impact\nof their utterances on the campaign\nto control Aids.\"\nDr Duesberg and his team\nseem to have a more sinister motive\nwhen they suggest that HIV\nvirus is \"harmless\".\nHe is directly or indirectly encouraging\nthe spread of the virus\nin Africa.\nAfricans who are every other\nconman seems to think are foolishly gullible should be strongly\ntold that if 200 million of them\ngot infected with the virus, Prof\nDuesberg may consider it an\n\"honour\" to be among those calculating\nhow much time HIV will\ntake to wipe out sub Saharan\nAfrica.\nThe incontestable point is that,\nthe HIV virus is not harmless.\nThe Aids epidemic in parts of\nEastern and Central Africa is\nreal. Other diseases are also killing\npeople but Aids is like all diseases - tuberculosis, cancers,\npneumonia, skin diseases and\nfungal infection - merged into\none.\nKenya's Minister for Health,\nMr Joshua Angatia recently said\nthat cases of tuberculosis are increasing\nin the country. This is\nbecause Aids virus damages the\nimmune system subjecting people\nto such diseases which in turn\nbecome resistant to the use of increased\nuse of antibiotics. Indeed\nin the US where Prof Duesberg\nresides, cases of drug resistant tuberculosis\nhave opened up another\npandora's box,\nThere is no proven cure or vaccine\nagainst Aids and the war\nagainst the disease basically involves\nprotective measures that include the use of condoms:\nHowever, as if Kenya and\nother nations do not have enough\nproblems, a local medical expert\nrecently said that condoms do\nnot offer protection against HIV\nand the virus may easily pass\nthrough their pores.\nEven if Dr Paul Wangai was\nspeaking from a \"religious or puritanical\"\nviewpoint, that advocates\nabstinence or sex in marriage\nonly, he is still wrong and\nhe knows it.\nA tale from the pulpit may\n\"enlighten\" him and others. How\ndoes one explain the case of one\nof the world's top ten evangelists\nwho was caught red handed with\na twilight girl in a red light\ndistrict soon after he had been\nstripped from power and\nhumiliated another \"top.\"\nborn-again and holy spirited\npreacher .for a similar offer ,\nThe reality is that condoms\nsave the lives of millions who\nmay engage in unprotected sex\nwith strangers or have multiple\npartners.\nA ,senior Deputy Director of\nMedical Services, Dr Pius Achola\nlast week said that people should\ncontinue taking every possible\nstep to protect themselves\nagainst Aids and recent Press reports\nthat the virus causing the\nlethal infection can easily pass\nthrough condoms are unfounded.\n\"All the evidence we have\nshows that condoms at least protect\npeople against not only unplanned\npregnancy but sexually\ntransmitted diseases including\nAids as well,\" he added.\nThe utterances also caused\nconcern among other health\nworkers struggling to control the\nspread of Aids. A UNICEF\nproject officer in charge of .\ncontrol, Ms Caroline Blair\nthat according to the latest scientific evidence published in two\nmedical journals - Sexually\nTransmitted Diseases and Family\nPlanning Perspectives _\ncondoms reduce exposure to Aids\nvirus by a factor of at least\n10,000.\nThe journals were quoting the\nresults of tests carried out by the\nUnited States Food and Drug Administration\n(FDA). She also said\nthat the new condoms for females\nwhich also offer protection\nagainst the Aids virus are proving\npopular, with 70,000 being distributed\nin some clinics in\nBritain.\nCondom use and encouraging\nintravenous drug users to resort\nto sterilised needles are all part of\ncrucial harm reduction strategies\nin the war against Aids which will\ndefinitely wipe out a million before\nthe end of the century."}
