{"text": "Painful truths on children's health\nSo accustomed are we to bad news these days that hearts\ntend to drop whenever a major ON agency announces the\npublication of an international study. Readers will recall it\nwas the UN Development Report a couple of months ago\nwhich lowered Kenya into the category of the world's 20\npoorest countries.\nThe newly released UN Children's Fund (Unicef) report\nfor 1994 also communicates some dire messages to our\nstruggling nation, but on the whole there seem, for once, to\nbe reasons for optimism as well as apprehension.\nPerhaps the best news in the report The State of the\nWorld's Children, is that Kenya's fertility rate has\ndeclined from 7.9 children per mother in 1979 to 5.4 this\nyear, a sharp and probably continuing decrease in this most\ncrucial of categories. Unicef attributed the decline to rising\nliteracy rates among women and greater opportunites for\nuse of family planning methods.\nInterestingly, a survey showed that Kenyan women aged\n40 to 44 consider the ideal number of children to be five\nwhile those aged 15 to 19 only want three. These\npreferences seem to refute the argument that women really want large families.\nThe fact that fertility decline was registered also in\nBotswana, Zimbabwe, Nigeria, Burundi, Mali, Senegal and Togo suggests that Africa could at long last be getting to grips with one of those traditions which have held it back\nfor so many years.\nThat it is too soon to celebrate goes without saying. It\ntakes only a quick look at our population growth rate -still\na massive 3.5 per cent - to acknowledge that there can be\nno let-up in our efforts to educate Kenyans, women in\nparticular, on the balance necessary between the joy of\nfamily and the responsibility for the care and nurturing of\nits members.\nOn the health front; most African nations, including\nKenya, have made good progress. the perpetual irony here\nis that success in the eradication of disease and\nprolongation of life undermine our parallel efforts to bring\nuncontrolled growth to heel. The two aims should be\npursued hand in hand, however, and it goes without saying\nfears about growth must not blunt the attack against killer\ndiseases.\nAccording to the Unicef figures, child deaths from\ndiarrhoea in Kenya are down from 4 million in 1983 to 2.9\nmillion in 1992, tetanus fatalities from 1.1 million to\n600,000, measles deaths have halved, whooping cough\nclaims 400,000 children against 700,000 and terminal polio\ncases are 140,000 against 1982's 400,000.\nThe reason the battle is being won in these areas is\nimmunisation. According to the UN experts, immunisation\nlevels worldwide have increased from under 20 per cent in\nthe 1980s to some 80 percent in the 1990s. Unicef itself\ncategorises this as \"one of the greatest achievements in\npublic health this century.\"\nIn Kenya, the average cover is 70 per cent though in some\nparts of North Eastern Province, only 10-15 per cent of\nchildren have received the necessary protection.\nHere is one of our persistent problems - the uneven\nspread of health care facilities and services. Indeed,\ndisadvantaged Kenyans know only too well that the\nproblem extends far beyond health facilities and services.\nThose areas without' decent medical care are usually' also\nthe ones With bad or no roads, dilapidated schools, a\ndeteriorating local economy and little development\nassistance.\nThis whole question of fair distribution of resources is a\nchallenge to our leaders and their sense of goodwill. As long\nas our national wealth is used in carrot or stick fashion for\npolitical purposes, so long will Kenya develop haphazardly\nand unfairly, with some marginalised areas dragging down\nthe rest. There will also grow a sense of grievance which\ncould prove a threat to the men who today wield the knife\nthat cuts the national cake.\nUnicef officials were frank about other problems: Our\nstreet children are growing in number, have no recognised\nrefuge centre, eat badly, have health problems and are\nsubject to sexual harassment; clean water, indeed any water,\nremains in short supply for a great many families; the\nenvironment is deteriorating because 80 per cent of\nKenyans live on the 17 per cent arable land.\nAs for Aids, it is a problem not just for Kenya or Africa\nbut for the world, and one that is not about to go away. One\nin every 13 Aids victims (there are 13 million round the\nworld) is a child. In sub-Saharan Africa one in every 40\npersons is HIV positive and in some African cities the\nfigure is one in three.\nThe implications of these figures are so appalling the\ntendency is to hope it's all a bad dream. In fact it's a waking\nnightmare and time we confronted it head-on."}
