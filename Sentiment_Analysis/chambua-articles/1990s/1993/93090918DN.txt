{"text": "HIV virus threatens children\nBy DAGI KIMANI\nAccording to Dr Paul Chuke, the\nWorld Health Organisation\n(WHO) representative in Kenya,\nup to 200,000 children may die of\nAids and Aids-related diseases by\nthe year 2000, and many more\nwill have to fend for themselves\nafter losing one or both parents\nto the disease.\nDr Chuke said this recently\nwhile giving a talk on the connection\nbetween Aids and Tuberculosis\norganised by the Aga Khan\nHealthy Services.\nBut as early as 1991, the United\nNations Children's Education\nFund (Unicef) warned that 5.5\nmillion children in the East and\nCentral African region which\ncomprises Kenya, Tanzania,\nZaire, Uganda, Zambia, Rwanda,\nBurundi, Malawi and the Central\nAfrican Republic would be Orphaned\nby Aids by the turn the\ncentury. A Unicef official, Mr\nNazaar Memon, then estimated\nthat of these, about 300,000\nwould be in Kenya.\nBut if the number of Aids-orphans\nis rising steeply, it is HIV positive children who pose the greatest challenge to the existing\nbut now cash-strapped health\ninfrastructure.\nMany of them have contracted\nthe Aids virus from their infected\nmothers, and most will die of\nAids-related complications before\nthe age of five.\nMedical experts say that about\nfifty per cent of infants born to\nHIV positive mothers contract\nthe deadly virus, most of them\nduring the course of pregnancy or\nbirth. A few are also thought to\nget infected by breast-milk.\nAs the number of infected\nwomen of child-bearing age continues\nto rise in line with general\nepidemiological spread, experts\nsay that more and more infants\nare bound to be born with Aids.\nToday, it is estimated that up\nto 500,000 women have been exposed\nto the Aids virus in the\ncountry, and statistics from Kenyatta\nNational Hospital - the\nnations main referral medical institution - indicate that between fifteen and twenty-five per cent\nof pregnant women attending\nprenatal clinics there have the\nAids virus.\nBut even as the number of congenitally\ninfected infants continues\nto rise dramatically, an increasingly\nalarming number of\nolder children are contracting the\ndisease as a result of illicit sexual\ncontact with infected adults."}
