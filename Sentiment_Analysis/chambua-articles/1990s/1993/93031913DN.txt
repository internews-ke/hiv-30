{"text": "Aids scourge takes toll\non local teenage girls\nBy WANGUI GACHIE\nAccording to the latest statistics\nreleased by the National Aids\nControl programme, the majority\nof the 76,000 IUV carriers in\nKenya are young teenage girls.\n'The girls are victims because\nolder men are now going for them\nand because teenage ,girls start\ntheir sex lives earlier than the\nboys,\" the Chairman of the Clinical programme\nsubcommittee Dr\nWilliam Jimbo revealed at an\nAids seminar convened last week.\nIn addition to this over 40 per\ncent of the children born to HIV\npositive mothers were testing\npositive at birth. This is just a\nsmall indication of the enormity\nof the problem that Aids will pose\nfor the younger generation.\nAddressing a gathering titled\nRomance in the Day of Aids,\nwhich convened last month, Dr\nPaul Wangai had his share of\nalarming statistics to reveal.\nDr Wangai maintained that\nthere was no such thing as safe\nsex. He said that the condom,\nwhich has been proposed as the\nsingle method through which one\ncan have sex without contracting\nAids, is questionable protection\nagainst pregnancy and even less\nagainst Aids.\nAccording to Dr Wangai, the\nlatest material that the condoms\nare made of is, by design, able to\nkeep human male sperm from\npassing through because the\npores in the material are smaller\nthan the width of a human\nsperm. However, Dr Wanglii contends that the Aids virus is so\nsmall that it can pass through the\npores of the latex thereby rendering\nthe method doubtful in preventing\nthe transmission of\nAids.\nDr Wangai further said that\nthere was supporting evidence\nthat many people who used the\ncondom did not know how to use\nit properly and consequently'\nthere was often resultant pregnancy due to spillage, breakage or\nother misuse.\n\"If this is the case with pregnancy\nthen the issue with Aids should be considered to be that\nmuch worse,\" he said.\nDr Wangai further alleged that\nexperiments have been conducted\nto show that the Aids virus could\npass through human skin within\ntwenty minutes. \"If body fluids\ncontaining the Aids virus are\nplaced on the skin, the virus has\nbeen shown to pass through the\nskin to an underlying culture medium,\"\nDr Wangai said.\nHis statements diametrically\noppose information issued by the\nWorld Health Organisation and\nthe National Aids Programme\nthat says the Aids virus cannot\nbe transmitted through. casual\ncontact such as a handshake or\nother forms of normal everyday\nhuman contact.\nDr Wangai urged youth to observe\nchastity before marriage\nand fidelity within marriage to\nprotect themselves against Aids.\nBut talking to Eric Wainaina, a\n19\u00b7year-old pre-university youth,\nit becomes evident that the youth\n. today are finding it extremely difficult\nto subscribe and adhere to\nDr Wangai's \"chastity and fidelity\"\nprescription.\nYouth today are grappling with\nimmensely difficult questions regarding\ntheir sexuality, bringing\nto fore confusion and anxieties\nthat they have to tackle as they\nattempt to forge their way to\nadulthood.\nIn a society that bombards\nthem with the dubious allure of\neasy sex, materialism, violence\nand the fake glamour of\nwesternisation and things American\nthe youth today are perhaps\nhaving one of the hardest times\ngrowing up in recent generations.\n\"Looking around at my age\nmates I sometimes wonder how\nwe are going to make it through\nthis time of our lives. The Bible\nin one of its scriptures says that\nthe youth should look to the\ncounsel of the elders but all I see\naround me is many young people\nwho have no one to counselor\nguide them,\" Eric said.\n\"I look around and see the constant abuse of sex by teenagers and it frightens me. All of us\nknow of sex the word, very few of\nus understand any thing about it.\nYou find that there is immense\npeer pressure these days that a\nyoung man make sure he gets a\ngirl to bed as soon as possible.\"\n\"Sex amongst teenagers these\ndays is a done thing and few of us\nare stopping to think of the consequences,\"\nhe said.\nSeveral months ago Eric participated\nin a play entitled\nChanging Generations by the\nPhoenix Players in which the\ntheme of youth and Aids was\nraised. In the play, Eric; portrayed\na young teenage Kenyan\nboy called JJ who is having a relationship\nwith a girl called\nKanini. Right from their first appearance\nthe couple are engaged\nin an argument over JJs infidelity,\nthe fact that he is fooling\naround.\nKanini in a moving solo asks\nhim, \"Why can't I be enough for\nyou? Why do you have to move\naround with other girls? What if\nyou catch Aids so early in your\nlife?\" echoing the sentiments of\nevery woman who has ever been\nin love.\nAfter trying unsuccessfully\nto convince him that there was a\nneed to reconsider his attitude\ntowards sex and the meaning of a\nrelationship, Kanini gives JJ an\nultimatum. \"Its me or the fresh\nflesh market, not both.\"\nJJ remains convinced that his\ngirlfriend is just being neurotic\nand clingy until his father very\nunexpectedly dies of Aids. Only\nthen does he realise how totally\nvulnerable we all are to Aids and\ndeath; how easy it is to lose the\nthings and people you love\nthrough recklessness how vitally\nimportant it is that you take care\nof the good things in life, such as\nlove and friendship.\nIt is then that Eric as JJ gives\nthe most moving rendition of a\nsong entitled, I did not know Until\nnow stating that it took the\ntragic death of his father for him\nto realise just how important this\nparticular relationship was to\nhim and just how much he would hate losing Kanini.\n\"JJ was just the ordinary Kenyan\nguy on the street. I see him\nand hear him everyday saying I .\ncannot get AIDS, I'm too young.\nThat is the part that perhaps\nfrightens me the most,\" he said.\nEric said that playing the part\nwas very difficult for him \"because\nin many ways Christine\nand I were actuaI1y playing ourselves\nin real life. It was too close\nto reality. It made you really\nthink about your life as a youth\nand the possibility of getting\naids this young- and the meaning\nof the relationships that we\nwere forming with the opposite\nsex,\" he said. ,\n\"There is a lot of pain being\nexperienced when young men bed\ngirls so that they can brag about\nit in school cloakrooms to their\ncronies. The girls in many instances,\nbeing perhaps more mature,\nenter into these relationships looking for emotional\nsecurity, friendship and something\ndeeper. The disparity between\nthese two sets of motives\nresults in many tears and broken\nhearts among my age mates,\" he\nsaid. He added that the threat of\nAids is becoming even more grave\ndue to the sexual habits that\nyouth are pressured into assuming\ndue to peer pressure.\n\"Even today peer pressure\npushes you to be part of the in\ncrowd and there is a lot of pretense\nas we all try so hard to be\npart of the crowd. I guess youth is '\nabout an extended confidence crises,\nnot knowing who you are\nwhile all the while wanting to give\nthem the hip version of you as\nopposed to you as you really are,\"\nhe said simply.\nAs economic times grow harder, more and more young girls fall\ninto prostitution at an earlier age.\nIt is indisputable that the issue of\u00b7\nAids and youth will be one of the\nmost urgent and growing concerns\nfor the health institutions\ndealing with the spread and development\nof Aids. The disease '\ncontinues to viciously ravage the\nmost productive sector of the\npopulation .\nAn Aids victim: Scourge poses greater danger to teenage girls"}
