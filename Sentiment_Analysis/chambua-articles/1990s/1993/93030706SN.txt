{"text": "Danger looms large.\nAn estimated one million Kenyans have been infected with the Aids-causing HIV virus. Most of\nthem do not know it; they are\nhealthy, they are active and they\nare having affairs with boyfriends\nand girlfriends.\nOne way of keeping Kenyans\nperpetually aware of the danger\nof Aids is to forever drum it into\ntheir ears that the disease has no\ncure, that it is 100 per cent fatal\nand that the only way to keep it\nin check is to check its spread.\nWherever a Kenyan looks he\nshould be able to see a billboard,\na poster, a pamphlet reminding\nhim of this scourge. The awareness\ncampaign must be everywhere\nany time, all the time.\n,But, alas, the Kenya Aids Control\nProgramme is short on\nfunds. According to the Unicef\nrepresentative to Kenya, Aids\nshould be treated as an emergency\ndevelopment issue or crisis\nthat deserves close donor attention because the disease could erode national progress and various\ndevelopment programmes.\"\nI agree and I support him to\nthe hilt when he says that the\nAids programme should not be\nsubjected to the donor\nconditionals given to Government departments."}
