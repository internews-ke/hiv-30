{"text": "There was something very sickening about the Hospital  Insurance\nFund board decision\nwhich was later rescinded by the\nMinister for Health.\nThe decision to limit payment\nfor contributors to a maximum of\n10 days stay in the hospital must\nhave been made by people who\nthink that an illness can be commanded\nto live within its means.\nOf course it cannot.\nWe were told that the decision\nhad been made because the shilling\nis ailing and thus lost its\npower but so has the contributors\npower to pay the Fund and meet\nother commitments.\nThe board had decided that it\nwas no longer going to cater for\nHIV -related illnesses. That\nsounded like a very sick joke\ncoming from the wrong end.\nThe Fund was telling Kenyans\nin many ways that stigmatising\nHIV-infected people is the right\nthing.\nHIV victims deserve help not\nspite and let the NHIF board not\ntell us that it is isolated Aids\ncases for zero refund in case of\nhospitalisation. There are other\navoidable afflictions that also require\nlong stay in hospital and\nthey have not been blacklisted.\nAs I write this, for example, a\ncigarette is dangling from my\nmouth and lung cancer could be\nbuilding up in my system. I really\ndon't how different I am from\nthat person who leads a careless\nsex life and contracts Aids and\nyet I won't be blacklisted by the\nNHIF in case of hospitalisation. "}
