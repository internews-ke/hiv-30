{"text": "What CARE is all about?\nCARE is an international non-governmental agency which was formed in 1945 to give emergency relief to needy families in Europe and Asia in the wake of the Second World War. Today, CARE focuses on improving lives of the poorest in the developing world and gives emergency relief to people whose lives are threatened by disaster.\nCARE's aim is to reach new standards of excellence in offering technical assistance, training and material resources in combinations appropriate to local needs and priorities. CARE supports processes that create competence and become self-sustaining over time. We also advocate public policies and programmes that support these ends.\nA confederation of 11 national, agencies with a coordinating international secretariat, CARE International is the largest non-sectarian, non-governmental aid organisation in the world.\nThe 11 CARE agencies (CARE Australia, CARE USA, CARE Canada, CARE Danmark, CARE\nDeutschland, CARE France, CARE Japan, CARE Osterreich, CARE Norge, CARE Britain and CARE Italian) work in partnership and operate through professional network supervised by national boards.
