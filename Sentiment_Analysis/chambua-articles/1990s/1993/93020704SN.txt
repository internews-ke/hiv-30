{"text": "Women urged to fight Aids\nBy SUNDAY NATION Reporter\nWomen must be in the forefront in the fight against Aids as they are \"in the centre of everything\" a lecturer at the University of Nairobi's Community Health Department, Dr Elizabeth Ngugi, said yesterday.\nDr Ngugi, who was addressing members of a new organisation known as the Society For Women and Aids, said 21,665 people aged between 15 and 44 had contracted Aids from 1984 to 1992.\nAn Assistant Minister for Culture and Social Services, Mrs Nyiva Mwendwa, who was supposed to launch the organisation, failed to turn up or send a representative.\nHowever, the organisation was launched. \n\nDr Ngugi said more young girls contracted Aids than their male counterparts because they started sex early.\nThe newly launched organisation, she said, was a chapter of the Society for Women on Aids in Africa.\nThe group suggested that a sessional paper on HIV and Aids must be devised. They said it was a shame that the ministry of Health was still working on a policy paper on Aids."}
