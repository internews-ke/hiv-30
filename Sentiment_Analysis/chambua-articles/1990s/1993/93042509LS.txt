{"text": "Cure or a cruel rip-off?\n\n\"I am angry because the newspapers give\nsuch people a chance to lie to people like me.\nI would not have even believed it if I had not\nread about him in the newspapers in the first\nplace,\" she said.\nWhen confronted with the accusation that\nhe was overcharging and exploiting sick, desperate\npeople, Dr Maingi insisted that those\nwho were making the allegations did not\nknow anything about his cure,\n\"If I have found a cure, then people should\nbe ready to pay for it even if it is half a\nmillion shillings. People pay that much money\nand more for heart transplants to save\ntheir lives. Why should they complain that I\nam charging too much when even the big\nhospitals in Nairobi are charging more than\nme?\" he asked.\nDr Maingi said it was wrong for people to\ndecide that he was overcharging when they\ndo not know how much he spent getting the\ningredients for his drug, or how rare such\ningredients were,\nWhen warned that if he failed to cure\nsomeone who has paid him he could face\nlegal charges regarding professional negligence\nand fraud, Dr Maingi said he was\nready for whatever legal action may be taken\nagainst him because he can stand by his\ndrug,\nHowever, he said he was not ready to submit\nhis findings to the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) because he feared\nthe potion would be stolen from him since he\nhad not patented it. He said he did not even\ntrust the World Health Organisation not to\nsteal his find.\n\"People travel to America for treatment;\nwhy are they finding it difficult to travel to\nMachakos?\" he asked.\n\"Why do I have to give my medicine to\nWorld Health Organisation when people can\ncome here?\" he asked,\nMr Joe Muriuki, the national co-ordinator\nof Know Aids Society, an organisation that\nbrings together HIV Positive people for\ncounselling and guidance, said he was worried\nabout how easily certain people were\nready to exploit HIV Positive people by offering\nthem impossible cures.\n.\u2022 He said there was need for people suffering from Aids to rise against such\nexploitation.\n, The Deputy Director of Medical Services,\nDr Naphtaly Agata, doubted the efficacy of\nthe Maingi medicine and said the Government\nwas willing to facilitate the validation\nof any preparation that a medical practitioner\nfelt could be beneficial to the treatment\nof Aids.\n\"Such practitioners who charge such high\nfees are taking advantage of the psychological\nincapacitation of those with Aids. It is\nmorally wrong and it is unlikely that the\nGovernment is going to sit back and let the\nsituation continue,\" he said.\nHe cited the case where a traditional practitioner\nin Uganda  who was claiming to have\na cure for Aids was arrested, and said it was\npossible for similar action to be effected\nlocally.\nHowever, it will take time before legal action\ncan be taken against practitioners who\nfail to deliver what they have promised because,\naccording to Dr Meshak Ndolo of the\nNational Aids Control Programme, the legal,\nissues surrounding Aids have not been ado'\ndressed adequately.\n\"The laws that bind doctors who fall under\nthe Ministry of Health are not binding\nfor practitioners who fall under the Ministry\nof Culture and Social Services. It appears\nthat it is this simple anomaly that traditional\ndoctors are taking advantage of to unscrupulously\nfleece an unsuspecting public who,\nin search of a cure for their life-threatening,\nailments, are ready to part with their lifetime\nsavings,\nWhat will become of Dr Maingi and his\nclaims remains to be seen, but there is little\ndoubt that even as you read this, someone\nwho is hoping against hope that this is not a\ncruel hoax is making his way to Machakos,\nIn the meantime, Dr Maingi's and other\ntraditional healers' miracle-cure claims can\nonly drive the wedge deeper between the traditional\nand conventional medical practitioners,\nwith the resultant build-up of acrimony\nand mistrust leaving many people in desperate\nneed of medical attention, \nA hopelessly sick Aids patient is helped to feed at a hospital. in Machakos:\nMany victims, desperate for a cure, are ready to pay anything to anyone\nwho convinces them they have a solution."}
