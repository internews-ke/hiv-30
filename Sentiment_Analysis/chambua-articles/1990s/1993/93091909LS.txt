{"text": "The ethical principles\nthat should guide medics\nMedicine is no doubt a noble profession, but do\nmedical professionals always live up to their\ncall to protect life!\nThis is an issue that doctors in Kenya and\nelsewhere have barely addressed themselves\nto Doctors have \"willingly\" been used by many\nautocratic regimes all over the world in a systematic\noppression of the so-called dissidents\nwho, in reality, are individuals whose personal\nphilosophies differs from those of the governors.\nThere are eases where doctors have been\nused to diagnose various forms of psychiatric\ndisorders and the patients banished to unpleasant\ntreatment centres.\nThis contradicts the popular view expressed\nby Nairobi psychiatrist Frank Njenga that doctors\nhave the moral and ethical duty to stand\nagainst inhuman conditions inflicted on their\npatients\u2022.\nAccording to Prof William Lore, chairman of\nthe Kenya Medical Association, medicine is\ngoverned by roles and regulations which must\nbe adhered to by the practitioners. This set of\nroles and regulations form the body of professional\nethics. Anyone who contravenes them is\nnormally reported to KMA for action.\nHowever, medics too are placed in no easy\nposition by circumstances that may limit their\noperation. Some of those circumstances are related\nto ethics vis-\u00e0-vis HIV virus infection, a\nvery sensitive subject in Kenya. .'\nFor example, Dr Njenga talks of an incident\nlast year when a woman tested HIV positive\nand when she was asked whether her husband\ncould be informed about it, she said no. The\ndoctor found himself in a difficult ethical position,\nwith serious medical and legal consequences\neither way.\nOn the one hand, he had an ethical duty to\nkeep the confidentiality of his patient's illness,\nand on the other, a moral responsibility to\nwarn the husband against further sexual interaction\nwith his infected wife and to check the\nspread of the virus. To complicate the matter, a co-wife had tested negative.\nProf Lore, who has taught medicine for the\nlast 35 years initially at the University of\nNairobi and now at Moi University, says KMA\ncannot take action against any doctor unless\nthere is an elaborate complaint.\nThe association has an ethics and standards\ncommittee which examines the complaints and\nadvises the executive committee on its validity.\nOnce this is done, says Prof Lore, the association\nthen decides whether or not to report the\ndoctor to the Medical Practitioners and Dentists\nBoard which is legally authorised to discipline\ndoctors and dentists.\nOtherwise ''the KMA is a voluntary professional association with limited legal and professional\nauthority on certain matters. Mostly we\nplay an advisory role. We can't discipline errant\nmembers,\" the chairman says.\nProf Lore says the association 18 very strict\non observance of the ethics and recommends\nstiff punishment for deceitful doctors. He says\nthey have been receiving letters from the public\ncomplaining about the charges by private\ndoctors. KMA has fee guidelines which private\npractitioners are required to follow. Those who\ndo not will norma1lyhave problems with their\npatients who may not be able to pay.\nIf a patient is unable to raise the fee, the\ndoctor can only seek redress by filing a civil\nsuit in court.\nSo KMA advises doctors to charge fairly to\navoid getting involved in time consuming legal\ntussles with their patients. The association has\nno right to force the patients to pay their doctors'\nfees.\n\"What we do is guard the public against\novercharging by doctors. I know we want to\nearn a living, but we have to earn it within\nphilosophical and moral bounds,\" he says..\nLocally, medical schools, both at Moi and\nNairobi universities, are planning to start\nteaching ethics and philosophy from the beginning\nof the MBChB programme.\n- GEORGE OWUOR\n\nMaladies\nin coping with the tears and fears of relatives.\nOn the other hand, doctors often achieve hero\nstatus in the eyes of an adoring public.\nA city doctor says one reason their problem\nAre not articulated in Kenya is that most senior\ndoctors are now wealthy and do not care about\n,- ...\u2022\u2022 down the ladder..\n\" :,;:'.,.random visit to the Jubilee Place in Wabera\n:street revealed that most private doctors were\neither on holiday or did not work afternoons and\nwere at home or in their clubs.\nTo some extent, this shows that private practitioners\nwork shorter hours than those in the public\nsector who work for more than 10hours a day.\nMeanwhile, Dr R. Pandya opined that that a\nPay rise for doctors in the public service is long\noverdue. He said that the profession is very demanding and\nsociety should not lose sight of their\nindispensability in creating a healthy nation.\nAsked how much a doctor in private practice\nearns, he said in any profession, private and public\npractice incomes are incomparable.\"It is like\ncomparing\" Mr Gershon Konditi, deputy executive director\nof the Federation of Kenya Employers, said doctors\nhave their own terms of service and should\nknow the right channel to follow.\nWhile he supports the demand for a 200 per\ncent pay rise, Mr Konditi feels that the doctors\nshould exhaust all the channels that exist in the\nMinistry of Health before resorting to ultimatums.\nThey should also ask themselves whether the\nEmployer has the capacity to award such an increase.\nHe cited the much-publicised salary and\nBenefits increase for legal officers in the Attorney-\nGeneral's chambers that stalled as the Government\ncouldn't pay.\nAnother medic, Dr P. Muthiga, said he wholly\nSupported the demand, adding that it was time the\nprofession was given commensurate\nremuneration.\nA doctor's job requires great sacrifice. Many\nare to be found in hardship areas under very\ndifficult conditions. Some work with relief agencies such\nas the Red Cross usually in life-threatening\ncircumstances. Daily, they are exposed to serious\nhazards such as Aids."}
