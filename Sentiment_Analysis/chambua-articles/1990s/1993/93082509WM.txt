{"text": "Deaths in African prisons alarming\nThroughout Africa,' hundreds of common law\ncriminals die in prisons each year largely\nunnoticed by the outside world. Diseases, poor\nnutrition and beatings .all contribute to such\n.deaths. Can the death ton in our prisons be\nreduced? Sam Gonza reports~\nMore than 977 prisoners died in Kenyan jails\nbetween. 1989 and  1992, an Assistant\nMinister, told Parliament recently. Over a similar three-year period, some 956 common law prisoners\ndied in South African 'prisons\" according to a news dispatch that quoted government authorities.\n These are official statistics\nthat may, represent only the tip of\nthe iceberg. There is an average\n30,000 inmates in Kenyan prisons\nand at least twice as many in\nSouth Africa, according to figures\n\u00b7available to the office of the Prison Fellowship International. '\nWhen large numbers of prisoners\ndie due to inhuman conditions\nor medical neglect, cover-\n,ups by the authorities are\ncommon. In 1992 in the Cameroon,\nAmnesty International moved swiftly to alert the world that large numbers of common\n'prisoners held on death row in one section of a camp known as Tcholliere II in Northern Cameroon, had died as a result of malnutrition and, medical neglect .\nThis forced the prison authorities\nto concede that for several\nmonths after December 1991, as\nmany as 70 inmates at Tcholliere\n:,\"may have died of meningitis and cholera ..\n\u00b7 Amnesty was concerned because\nreliable information that trickled out .of Tcholliere had indicated futher large numbers of prisoners \nwere bound to die if they were not availed the\nurgent medical attention required. At least 30 of those prisoners had tuberculosis.'\nThe spread of the Acquired\nImmuno Deficiency Syndrome\n(Aids) within the prison system\nin Africa should be a cause for\nserious concern but few prison\nauthorities admit it,. In Kenya, a\ndoctor who worked in a prison in\nthe Rift Valley province for a\nnumber of years told a recent\nmedical congress in Nairobi that\nit was ,perturbing to hear. from\nother prison medical workers\nelsewhere in the country that\nmany prisoners were HIV positive.\nHe wanted a study done to\nfind out why this was happening.\nThere appears to be similar\nconcern in Zimbabwe, where according\nto news agency dispatch,\na judge felt pity on a young\nman and declined to send him to\nprison. The judge said he feared\nthe young man would become\njust another Aids casualty if he\nwas locked up .\n, While the authorities are busy\ndenying that this tragic situation\nexists within the prisons in\n.Kenya, and ex-convict has volunteered\nan explanation for it.\nFrancis Syenge told local newspapers\nthat corporal punishment\ninflicted on\u00b7 prisoners could be a\nmajor contributory factor for\n\"the alarming increase of AIDS\ncases at the Kamiti Maximum\n'Security Prison\", just outside\n'Nairobi. Ex-convict Syenge claimed that prison authorities\n\"do not sterilise the cane\".\nEvery stroke of the cane drew\nblood and the same cane was\nused on as many as ten prisoners.\nThe prison 'authorities denied\nthis but Kenya's Attorney General,\nAmos Wako. immediately\npromised a full enquiry into the\nclaim.\nBesides killer diseases like\nAIDS, TB, Cholera, meningitis\u00b7\nand malaria which spread like wildfire in the stressful and crowded prison conditions, prisoners\nare usually made to work\nand live in very difficult and even\ndangerous circumstances.\nA prison warder who works at\na prison station in Central\nKenya, who prefers anonymity,\nsays malnutrition is endemic\neven where prisoners grow ample\nfood in state farms.\nPrison uniforms are torn or absent.\nAt times, prisoners may be left naked. There is a scarcity of blankets and prisoners sleep 'on bare\nfloors, suffering exposure ,Even more disturbing, he says: \": work in a station where the officer\nin charge insists that the inmates must work in the fields whether it is raining or not.\" Significantly, too, he says prison warders' hearts \"are not in it. ,We are not proud of being in the prisons department. There is no point in being devoted any more and we do not care whether it fails,\" said one.\nHaphazard beatings are apparently\nvery common. 'When the government released death statistics last month, Prof Joseph\nMuga, a former political detainee\nwho is now an opposition MP,\nrevealed that when he was locked\nmore than a decade ago, he\nregularly heard the cries of prisoners\nin the night. He believes\nthat beatings contributed to\ndeaths in jails in Kenya .\nThe country has one of the\nmost extensive prison chaplaincies\nin Africa, yet it has taken so\nlong for this tragic situation to be\nrevealed? ~_\nof the Kenyan Chapter of the\nPrison Fellowship International\nhas challenged the churches and\nmedical workers within the prison\nestablishments in Africa, to\nhelp improve the conditions under\nwhich prisoners live since\nthey are human beings too.\n\"Prison chaplains can notice\nwhat happens to prisoners since\nthey are charged with improving\nthe spiritual and physical welfare\nof inmates,\" he says.\nHe appeals to medical, welfare\nand church workers not to allow\nthemselves to be submerged in\nthe prison bureaucracy to the\npoint that they neglect the wellbeing\nof the people they are there to serve in the first place \"There is great danger of becoming too obedient to the prison rule even when this is in conflict with ones moral, beliefs and human feelings of pity or concern, he notes. \nHe laments that most civil servants who run the prison system do so purely as a career rather than for any humanitarian reasons.  These people give little thought to the rehabilitation and social protection of prisoners under their charge, he adds. APS Features\nInmates learning carpentry in one of the jails in Kenya.
