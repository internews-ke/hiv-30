{"text": "We should give Kemron a chance\nA lot of controversy has been generated concerning the efficacy of the Aids drug Kemron, in patients with HIV infection. A letter appeared in Mailbox on August 8 from Mohamed Ali of Hola supporting the efficacy of Kemron and saying how it helped him and some of his friends.\nThis cannot go unsupported for I was personally involved in the trial of Kemron on children with HIV infection at the Coast General Hospital for a period of four months from August to November in 1991. The trial involved three children who were positively identified in have HIV infection together with some of its manifestations namely recurrent diarrhoea, weight loss, skin changes, partial gland enlargement, low grade fever. All of them did not have all the above symptoms at the same time but in different combinations.\nAt the beginning of treatment, all the basic tests were done; chest X-ray, blood test including white cells and red cells count, liver and kidney function tests and urine and stools examinations.\nUnfortunately, CD4 cells tests were not done at that time.\nThe children were taught how to keep the Kemron tablet under their tongue and a dose of half a tablet a day was given over a period of four months together with other medications when needed.\nTwo of the children showed clinical improvement after 2 months: increase in appetite and weight, decrease in thyroid gland enlargement and normal skin reappeararices.\nGenerally, one can say that there was clinical improvement in two children. The third child unfortunately did not respond to the drug and kept on deteriorating.\nI know that this was a small trial and leaves a lot of questions unanswered for which I will get a lot of criticism, but I still feel that Kemron should not be discarded but made readily available for more trials so that we can all benefit.\nMohamed Hanif Zizimawalas (Dr)\nMombasa."}
