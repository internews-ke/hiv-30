{"text": "Little desperate girls drift into prostitution\nTragically, they don't know about AIDS and operate as if the killer disease does not exist at all.\nBy O. OWUOR and G. OWUOR\nArticle 34 of the Convention on the\nRights of the Child demands that\ncountries protect children from all\nforms of sexual abuse and\nexploitation. But African nations, Kenya\nincluded, are doing very little to curb the\nincreasing number of child prostitutes and\nreduce sexual exploitation.\nAccording to social workers, nine out of\nevery 10 girls living in the streets either have\na sexually transmitted disease or have been\ntreated for one in the past. Even more\nhorrifying is the discovery that three out of\nevery 10 girls in the streets have HIV virus\nwhile four out of every 10 have a '\ncombination of one or two sexually\ntransmitted diseases.\nEzra Mbogori of Undugu Society says that\nout of 12 cases of sexually transmitted\ndiseases among street children aged 13 to 17,\nat least four were HIV positive.\nIndeed among Nairobi's street children\nsome of the young girls tend to stop begging\nfor money as they approach their ninth or\n10th birthday and \"disappear\".\nThe girls plunge into an intricate child\nprostitution 'ring that has rapidly spread to\nall parts of the country.\nDuring the day,' one hardly sees any young\nprostitutes roaming the streets of Nairobi.\nHowever, things are different in the evening\nwhen a large number of young girls pour into\nthe streets for prostitution.\nSometimes, men accompanied by their\nwives or other female relatives or friends are\nconfronted by girls aged between 12 - 15 who\nbravely ask: \"What are you doing with that\nold woman.\"\nTragically, these young girls don't know\nabout AIDS and they operate as if the killer\ndisease does not exist.\nThere are chilling stories of AIDS-infected\nmen who have become major customers of the child prostitutes.\nDr Florence Maguyu, a leading paediatrician\nwho is actively involved in the\nMedical Women's Association, says street\nchildren are more at risk of contracting\nAIDS because of their economic problems.\nShe says that street girls are exploited by\nmen who lure them with small material\nbenefits. At the same time, street children\nhave sexual intercourse among themselves\nspreading the AIDS virus among themselves.\nHowever, the young girls are also being\nguided into prostitution by adults including\ntheir own mothers or guardians.\nThis is common if the mothers or\nguardians are former prostitutes who see the\nyoung girls as commercial sex workers\ncapable of generating profits with minimal\nmaintenance.\nDr Elizabeth Ngugi, a former chief nurse,\nsays that research carried in Nairobi.\nindicate that 800 prostitutes reported to\nhave died of AIDS in one of the city slum's\nhave left behind a large number of street\nchildren who are also likely to die from the\ndisease.\nChild prostitution is not confined to\nNairobi. It has spread to all Kenya's urban\nareas.\nThere is very limited data on the exact\nnumber of child prostitutes because most\noperate secretly. Some people say what we\nsee in the streets is just the tip of the iceberg\nand the number of child prostitutes\ncountrywide could be more that 20,000.\nEarly marriages are another form of child\nsexual exploitation. In some communities,\nespecially in the semi-arid areas, girls aged\nnine are married to men who are old enough'\nto be their grandfathers.\nAlthough laws of the country prohibit\nhaving sex with girls below 14, there is\nsilence when it comes to traditional\nmarriages that occur when female children\nare still premature physically and mentally."}
