{"text": "WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 1993\n\nA \u201cwindow of hope\u2019 in campaign against Aids\n\nBy ELS HOOVER\u2028\nUnicef has opened a -\u2028\nnew front in the battle\u2028\nagainst Aida in Uganda\u2028\nwhere the disease s\u2028\nthe leading cause of\u2028\ndeaths among adults and the\u2028\nsixth among children under five.\u2028\nArmed with statistics indicating that children between the age\u2028\nof five 5 and 15 are virtually\u2028\nAids-free, Unicef is targeting the\u2028\nyouth in an ambitious educational  programme \u2014 Safeguard Youth\u2028\nfrom Aids (Syfa);\u2028\nIn a country where more than 9 per cent of the population of 1.6.\u2028\nmillion was considered HIV positive, studies show that children\u2028\nwho are infected by their antenatal mother do not reach the age\u2028\nof 5. At about the age of 15, most\u2028\nyoungsters have their first sexual experiences and from that point\u2028\nthe rate Aids cases increase rapidly. . . ..\u2028\nThe $yta project concentrates\u2028\non children between the age of\u2028\nfive and 19. . . - \u2018\u2028\nThis is how, B\u00e8rnadette\u2028\nOlowo-Froers, a Unicef project\u2028\nofficer concerned with Aids research and evaluation, sees it:\u2028\n\u201cUnicef started Aids progranmes in Uganda in 1980. At\u2028that time we emphasised on awareness. But most people know\u2028\nby now what Aids is and about its risks. The problem is that they\u2028\njust don\u2019t act that way. That\u2019s ,\u2028\n\u2018why Syfa tries to establish a \u2018\u2018-\u2028\nbehaviour change and to succeed \ndoing so you have to start young. \u2018\u2028\n\u201cWe call they are between five\u2028\nAnd l5 the- \u201cwindow of Hope\u201d. \u2028\nThese are the ages before\u2019 the sexual drive is well established, attitudes and practices are not yet\u2028\nfirmly set and can be moulded. At\u2028\nthese ages, children\u2019s behaviour is\u2028\nstrongly mouldable by persons\u2028\nwith a natural interest in\u2028\nchildren.\u2028\n\u201cOf course you cannot address\u2028\nthe message of Aids to the whole\u2028\ngroup in the same way. Therefore\u2028\nwe divide them into three: five to\u2028\n9 years o1d, 1O to 14 and I5 to 19.\u2028\n.We teach them values like\u2028\n\u2018looking after myself makes me\u2028\nstrong and bright\u2019. The young\u2028\nones learn this through plays and\u2028\nfunny games In that way they\u2028\nadapt beliefs about the\u2028\nconsequences  of their behaviour\u2028\nand the value placed on each possible consequence. If we then provide the enabling factors to establish the right behaviour, like\u2028\nrecreation clubs, condom and information on services, the chance\u2028\nthat they get Aids decreases. In fact, the message is not only\u2028\nabout Aids. It\u2019s health in general\u2028\nand a healthy body does not have\u2028\nAids. . .\u2028\n1 \u201cThe challenge now is how to\u2028\nclose the behavioral gap. Information -and education do not\u2028\npump behavioral change\u2028\nmerely by-being accentuated or\u2028\nmodified to achieve this you\u2028\ndon\u2019t only target the children, but\n\nalso parents and teachers who are\u2028\n\u2018the children\u2019s biggest infiuence.\u2019\u2028\nUgandans, evidence shows, do\u2028\nnot speak about sex and any education on this issue is given too late. Through Syfa, Unicef is also\u2028\ntrying to make parents and\u2028\nteachers aware of their responsibilities towards children. Give\u2028\nthem honest answers when they\u2028\nstart asking questions, Unicef\u2028\nsays, even hen that is at the age\u2028\nof five. .\u2028\nUnicef tries to send the message to the adults through religious bodies, Resistance Councils, and teachers\u2019 training\u2028intitutions, among others. &t\u2028\napart from that the opinions of\u2028\ntheir parents and teachers, peer\u2028\nhave a major impact. That is\u2028\nwhy, for example, scouts and\u2028\nguides participate in the Syfa programme. \u2018 .\u2028\nValelian Byaboneka, district\u2028\nexecutive commissioner for\u2028\nscouts, speaks highly about Sya.\u2028\n\u201cThe youth are very intelligent. :.\u2028\nYou can\u2019t lock them in a safe.\u2028\nThey need to be exposed to the -\u2028\nenvironment, to people, so to eliminate\u2028\ndangers of Aids. That\u2019s why the ,\u2028\nmain objective of Syfa \u00a18 making\u2019\u2028\nthe youth realise it\u2019s their own responsibility to save their bodies. -\nThy should not expect that\u2028\nwhen parents guard them, they\u2028\nhave to do it themselves. This is\u2028\nwhat they learn during the Syfa activities in which they participate during their leisure, not during classwork.\u2028\nHe adds \u201cWe implemented the\u2028\nidea that whatever they are doing\u2028\nin their spare time can carry the\u2028\nmessage against Aids. So they\u2028\nlearn through songs and role\u2028\nplays, for example, what Aida is,\u2028\nhow you can prevent it and that\u2028\ngirls can say no if a boy wants .\u2028\nsex.\u201d\u2028\nOne of the scout groups that\u2028\nStarted to promote  Syfa is from\u2028\nthe from Kalinabiri Primary\u2028\nSchool in Kampala. Children\u2028\nthere are very enthusiastic about\u2028\nthe programme. One of them ex-\u2028\nplains what they do during a role\u2028\nplay:\u2028\nWe first sing \u00e3 song about\u2028\nAids. Today it\u2019s me. After that\u2028\nthere are two children who start\u2028\nplaying talk about Aids and our\u2028\nfriends who died because of it. A\u2028\nsilent child comes on the stage.\u2028\nHis parents are suffering from\u2028\nAida. They are seriously sick and\u2028\nin hospital. His friend then asks\u2028\nhim about his parents then he\u2028\nteaches him properly about Aids,\u2028\nwhile he is crying.\u201d\u2028\nApart from plays and self\u2028\nsongs, they do artwork with the\u2028\nmessage: You have to keep\u2028\nhealthy.\u2028\nAlthough these children are\u2028\nvery young, about nine years old,\u2028\nthey are we aware of the risks of\u2028\nsome sexual behaviour. The\u2028\ndepth of their knowledge is both\u2028\nastounding and reassuring."}
