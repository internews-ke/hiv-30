{"text": "March 28, 1993\nCreating hope where fear reigned: Vital points for Aids sufferers\nFROM FEAR TO HOPE by Glen Williams,\nActionAid, Amrefand World in Need, 1992\n(Revised Edition), pp.35\nReviewed by OKUMBA MIRUKA\n\"Vou have HIV and you will probably get\nAids, but there is nothing we can do to help\nyou\". Ha victim was told this, he would most\nlikely get closer to the grave than he would\nhave done otherwise.\nThus, From Fear to Hope concludes that\nthe best way to approach the issue is to\ncounsel the victim and family to help them\nunderstand first the difference between HIV\nand Aids and then how to cope with the\ndisease.\nFrom Fear to Hope is the first in a series\nof Strategies for Hope books designed to\ndisseminate information on management of\nAids. Starting from the premise that there\nare at least 1.5 million people suffering from\nAids worldwide and that this number\nincreases by leaps and bounds, the document\nreiterates that there is as yet no cure for the\ndisease.\nHowever, it adds, ''this does not mean that\npeople with HIV or Aids should be neglected\nby health services, rejected by their families\nand friends and abandoned by society\" .\nThe proposed ethic is now in practice in\nZambia at the Chikankata Salvation Army\nHospital where a famiy-based care for Aids\nvictims has been designed in line with\nAfrican extended family lifestyles and care\nsystems.\nThe system involves visits to the patients\nby hospital staff consisting of a counsellor,\nnurse, social worker and health educator .\n. The team does not only console the patient\nand the family; they also educate them on\nthe nature of the disease and seek consensus\non how to manage it.\nFor those who have been tested positive,\nthe team advises that they share the\ninformation with their families but does not\nforce them to do so. Furthermore, the team\ntakes the initiative to inform the community\nwhen one of their members has died from\nthe disease.\nThis plays a significant role in helping\nthem avoid performing certain rituals that\nmay spread the disease. One such ritual is\nthe cleansing ceremony for a widow which\nrequires that she has intercourse with a\nclose member of the family.\nThe book observes that there are three\ntypical responses to Aids. The first is \"denial\nand minimisation of the problem\"; the\nsecond is \"reluctant acceptance\"; and the\nthird is \"constructive engagement\", the last\nstage usually coming after a catastrophe.\nIn Zambia, it was speeded up in 1987when\nthe former President-Kenneth Kaunda\npublicly confessed that one of his sons had\ndied of the disease. This gave official support\nto the anti-Aids campaign and has seen the\nevolution of a combative way of dealing with\nthe disease.\nWhether other African countries have\nreached the stage is easily answerable in the\nnegative. Yet it IS imperative that they do so\nbecause Africa is especially vulnerable given\nthat it teems with opportunistic tropical\ndiseases that accelerate the development of\nHIV to Aids.\nTo say the least, the booklet is an\nadmirable and informative piece that\ndeserves to be read by anyone involved  the management of Aids.\nOrganisations wishing to receive copies of\n'the Strategies for Hope documents may .\ninquire through TALC, P.O Box 49, St\n.A1bans.H~rts ALl 4AX, U.K."}
