{"text": "Which is the proper test for Aids?\nThe Daily Nation used to run a column that discussed medical issues by Dr Amref. A long timehas \u00b7elapsed since I last read this column.\nBut whatever the circumstances\nthat led to the disappearance\nof this educative column, it\nis my hope that the newspaper\nwill fulfill its duty of educating its\nreaders on the topical issue of\nAids.\nIn particular, I would have\nwished DrArnref or anyone in\nthe know to discuss authoritatively\non the official proper procedure\nfor the diagnosis of HIV I\nAids in this country.\nFor some in the medical field,.\nthe procedure is that blood from\npatients is first screened for HIV antibodies using the Elisa test. Those found negative on this\ntest are considered free of the infection\nwhile those who test positive on this initial test are referred to another .confirmatory\ntest - the Western blot. Those\nwho test positive on both tests\nare considered HIV positive.\nHowever, those that are negative\non the Western blot are considered\nfree of infection. ,\nYet there are others who use\nthe sera-haemo-gluttination test.\nWhich is the proper and official\ntest to be employed in respect\nof the HIV virus? Is the sera-haemo-\ngluttination test confirmatory\nwhen positive? Yowel Duda Mombasa"}
