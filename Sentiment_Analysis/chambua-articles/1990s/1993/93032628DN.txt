{"text": "March 26, 1993\nNew insight into\nAids in Africa\n\nA major television investigative programme last night produced a\u2028\nstartling report on the issue of\u2028\nAids in Africa, claiming that the\u2028\ncontinent was not in the grip of\u2028\nan Aids epidemic.\u2028\nThe report, based on studies by\u2028\nmedical experts in Uganda and\u2028\nCote d\u2019Ivoire, claimed that predictions by the World Health\u2028\nOrganisation arid other agencies\u2028\nthat millions will die because of\u2028\nHIV infection are not based on\u2028\nscientific evidence but on un\u2028\nfounded assumptions about the\u2028\nlinks between HIV and Aids.\u2028\nAccepted medical wisdom is that HIV infection will eventually\u2028\nlead to Aids but, over recent\u2028\nmonths, a minority of medical\u2028\nopinion has differed over this.\u2028\nThe leading medical thinker on\u2028\nthis is Professor Peter Duesberg,\u2028\nthe University of California virologist who argues that HIV is\u2028\nharmless and does not cause\u2028\nAids.\u2028\nNow, in the first serious study\u2028\nof this theory in Africa, the\u2028\nChannel 4 TV programme Dispatches accompanied Dr Harvey\u2028\nBialy, a leading American scientist with long experience of\u2028\nAfrica, on a fact-finding trip.\u2028\nHis opinion was that there is\u2028\n\u201cabsolutely no believable persuasive evidence that Africa is in the\u2028\nmidst of a new epidemic of infectious imuno-deficiency\u201d.\u2028\nThe theory is that where death\u2028\nrates have increased in Africa,\u2028\nthis is because of civil war, poverty linked to economic decline and\u2028\nthe growing use of hard drugs,\u2028\nparticularly among prostitutes.\u2028\nBoth Dispatches and the Yun\u2028\nday Times, which ran an article\u2028\nabout the issue last weekend, said\u2028\nestablished medical opinion dis\u2028\nagreed completely with such\u2028\nviews which it said would \u201cout\u2028\nrage\u201d Western medical opinion.\u2028\nBecause of the World Health\u2028\nOrganisation\u2019s concern about\u2028\nAids in Africa (they claim 7.5\u2028\nmillion people are infected with\u2028\nHIV in sub-Saharan Africa), this\u2028\nhas led to scarce resources increasingly being allocated to Aids\u2028\nprevention at the expense of\u2028\nother killer-diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis and other infectious ailments.\u2028\nThe Ugandan Government, for\u2028\nexample, which can afford less\u2028\nthan $1 a head on health care,\u2028\nreceives $6 million for Aids re\u2028\nsearch and prevention from\u2028\nforeign agencies, including the\u2028\nWHO.\u2028\n\u201cFear of Aids is having almost\u2028\nas great an effect as Aids itself,\u201d\u2028\nthe Sunday Times said. \u201cPeople\u2028\nare frightened of going to see a\u2028\ndoctor, because they believe they\u2028\nwill be diagnosed as having Aids\u2028\n\u2014 and feel condemned to death.\u201d\u2028\n\u201cIt has become a joke in\u2028\nUganda that you are not allowed\u2028\nto die of anything but Aids,\u201d Dr\u2028\nBialy said. \u201cA favourite story is\u2028\nthat a friend has just been run\u2028\nover by a car; doctors put it down\u2028\nas Aids-related suicide.\u201d\u2028\nDr Bialy believes that part of\u2028\nthe problem is that HIV testing is\u2028\nfrequently misleading in Africa.\u2028\nThe tests react to antibodies to\u2028\nmalaria as well as HIV, producing\u2028\nup to 80-90 per cent false\u2028\npositives. \u2028\nOne British expert puzzled by\u2028\nthe disparity between apocalyptic\u2028\nwarnings about the spread of\u2028\nAids in Africa and her own observations is Professor Beverly Griffin, a virologist at the Royal\u2028\nPostgraduate Medical School in\u2028\nLondon.\u2028\nFor the past seven years, she\u2028\nhas received blood samples of\u2028\nhundreds of children in Malawi.\u2028\nThe proportion of those that are\u2028\nHIV-positive has remained un\u2028\nchanged at one or two per cent,\u2028\nwhich casts doubt on claims that\u2028\nMalawi is in the grip of an HIV\u2028\nepidemic.\u2028"}
