{"text": "Verify herbalist's AIDS claim\nI would like to comment an a story\nwhich appeared in the Sunday\nNation of April 25 in which a\nherbalist, S.K. Maingi, was\nquoted as having discovered a\ncure for the deadly disease, Aids.\nAccording to. Maingi, he uses\nsame special stones from the\nKyullu Hills in his home district\n(Machakos) to' make a concoction\nhe has nicknamed \"Chamilion\" or\n\"Radi\" (lightning) to get the cure.\nMaingi claims that this concoction\ncures Aids. He went further\nand explained how \"chamilion\"\nor \"radi\" makes the lymphacytes\n(white cells) evade the HIV virus\nwhich causes Aids in human\nbeings.\nHe explained how the white\ncells camouflage themselves (just -\nlike how a chameleon camouflages\nitself from its enemies by\nchanging its color according to\nits environment) from the HIV\nafter his patients have taken the\nconcoction.\nAccording to the herbalist, the\nbody\u2019s white cells turn greyish in\ncolour with the help of this concactian\nand camouflage themselves\nfrom the HIV virus, thus\nevading the attack (from HIV).\nIf what Maingi claims his concoction\ncan do to the body\u2019s white cells is true, then it will be\na kind of a breakthrough in Mankind's fight against Aids.\nThis means that the body\u2019s entire \nimmune system still remains\nintact even in the presence of the\nHIV virus and it (the body) can\nstill defend itself against other\n'Opportunistic pathogens.\nThe Kenya Medical Research\nInstitute (KEMRI) officials\nshould verify the herbalist's\nclaims scientifically by conducting\nscientific research on the chemical contents of this\nconcoction.\nKEMRl's biochemists should\ntake a sample and subject it to.\nthorough labratary analysis.\nThey shauld also study the mode\nof actioan of the concoction\n(which Maingi claims cures Aids)\nby administering it to. Aids patients\nand observing them carefully\nbefore reaching aconclusion.\nIndeed, there are numeraus scientific\nstudies which have been carried out that explain how\nsame pathogens deceive the entire\nimmune system of the human body befare they attack\nthe white cells and cause serious diseases.\nSame of these pathogens use\ncamauflage tactics to evade being\ndetected by the body's immune\nsystem.\nHIV also uses the same camauflage\ntactics to evade the immune\nsystem befare it mounts its\nattack an white cells known as T4\ncells.\nThe T4 cells are special white\ncells which defend the body's immune\nsystem against pathogens.\nSo.if, accarding to Maingi, these\nwhite cells (T4) can camouflage\nthemselves from the HIV virus\nand evade attack, then it means\nthe entire body immune system\nstill remains intact and the body\ncan still defend itself against\nother pathogens.\nTherefore, if Maingi's claims\ncan be verified and scientifically\ntested it will verify whether his\nclaim have any credit and can\ntherefore be taken as a major\nbreakthrough.\nCharles Olieno Auko,\nSenior Research Scientist,\nKARI, Thika"}
