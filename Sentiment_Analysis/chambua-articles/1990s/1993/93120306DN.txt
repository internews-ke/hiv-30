{"text": "Once again, Aids\nawareness counts\nSo another World Aids Day has come and gone. Liza Minelli sang to an audience of sympathisers in the United States, health workers deluged us with statistics, an angry activist heckled President Bill Clinton and victims and bereaved told the stories of their sufferings.\nBut still no end to the scourge is in sight.\nFourteen million people around the world, about half of them in sub-Saharan Africa and at least 800,000' in Kenya, now suffer from the Human Immuno Deficiency Virus (HIV). This figure could reach 40 million by the year 2000.\nSome 35,000 Kenyan children are nursing the virus and sooner or later will almost certainly die from its effects, while another 31,000 have been orphaned already by the deaths of their Aids-stricken parents.\nRandomly collected facts on Aids Day in Kenya:\nAids patients occupy 30 per cent of the 400 beds in Eldoret District Hospital and are dying at the rate of six per week.\nAt the Kisumu District Hospital half of all patients have Aids and up to five new ones are being admitted every day.\nA total of 1,533 people were screened at Embu Provincial Hospital and 336 tested positive. Most were women.\n\u2022 In Nairobi, Provincial Commissioner Francis Lekolool said Aids threatened to destroy the country unless its spread was checked.\nIt is noteworthy that in all this talk, both here and abroad, there is very little mention any more of a cure or even a vaccine. A noted American activist, playwright Larry Kramer, said he expected none before the end of the century and he lamented what he saw as a new attitude towards the pandemic, a sort of resigned complacency.\nIndeed in some areas the tendency has been towards\nDenial.\nA leading British newspaper, for instance, has launched a campaign against the \"Aids industry,\" comparing early overblown predictions against proven statistics, decrying what it considers to be disproportionate expenditure on the disease and claiming that Aids has remained largely confined to the high-risk categories of homosexuals and intravenous drug users.\nThe newspaper even tried to argue that Aids in Africa is exaggerated.\nFrom its tiny Eurocentric (and dare one suggest\nhomophobic?) viewpoint, the newspaper may be right- to criticise the wolf-crying tactics of early Aids activists and the over-reaction of some panicked health workers.\nBut in Afica, Aids is a family tragedy not confined to any particular category - indeed its principal victims are heterosexual, drug-free men and women. Nor is our death toll any kind of exaggeration, as coffin makers in Zambia,\nUganda, Kenya and most other countries will quickly attest.\nFor our society, lacking any immediate prospect of a cure or even a protective vaccine, the only possible means of checking the spread of Aids is by prevention.\nThankfully, after a period of denial similar to the one we have just considered, our government has taken thoughtful and decisive measures. The National Aids Control Programme under the Ministry of Health is seeking to integrate anti-Aids scheme into the National and District Development plans for 1994 - 96 \nOfficials are acutely aware that high costs of health care, long absenteeism and extensive loss of life could have a devastating impact on the national economy. The vast majority of victims 'are aged between 20 and 45, those years when men and women contribute most to the economic development of the nation.\nWith the assistance of the UN Development Programme and various arms' of the administration, officials have organised workshops at district and provincial level and a nationwide conference. Guidelines have been produced for home care of victim and the rational use of blood, and education programmes were set up for private sector companies. The\" UN Children's Fund supports Aids education in schools.\nWe argued in the these columns a few days ago in favour of biological education in the classroom to reduce the incidence of teenage pregnancies. Surely the threat of Aids is an even stronger reason to instruct our young people on the dangers inherent in sexual adventure.\nAmong the early writings on Aids, a young New York man described the final stages of his partner's bodily destruction by the virus. Shortly before his death, he wrote, the victim was so wasted and his skin so \u00b7translucent that his heart was clearly visible as it beat away his final hours.\nPerhaps the moralists among us might ponder on this\nhorrifying image when seeking to deny the. young\u00b7 the knowledge which may save them from a similar  end."}
