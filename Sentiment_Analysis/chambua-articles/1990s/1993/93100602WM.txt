{"text": "Wednesday, OCTOBER 6, 1993\n\nMedicineman shoots to instant fame\n\nOn a typical day at his \u201csurgery\u201d recently, 31 men and women, among them a West African diplomat, waited anxiously but in stony silence for Burombo to hand them their daily medication.\n\nBy FRANCIS MOALONGWA\u2028\nIn Harare\u2019s Kuwadana township, a signpost greets visitors to Doctor Benjamin\u2028\nBurombo\u2019s red-brick house:\u2028\n\u201cWelcome to House 2627 \u2014\u2028\nTrespassers will be Prosecuted.\u201d\u2028\n\u201cI never wanted to put this notice on my house but there have\u2028\nbeen just too many people coming here, some without legitimate\u2028\nbusiness,\u201d Burombo explains.\u2028\nThe legitimate business in this\u2028\ncase is being afflicted by Aids, an increasingly common hazard in\u2028\nZimbabwe.\u2028\n\u201cI want to see only those who\u2028\nwant to be cured of Aids,\u201d said\u2028\nthe 34-year-old healer, sporting rastafarian-style dreadlocks.\u2028\nTimes have never been better\u2028\nfor Burombo, whose name in hi\u2028\nnative Shona translates as \u201cthe\u2028\npoor man.\u201d\u2028\nHe has shot to instant fame in\u2028\nthe past few months after state\u2028\ntelevision and national newspapers publicised his claim of being\u2028\nable to cure Aids for which there\u2028\nno known cure.\u2028\nOn a typical day at his \u201csurgery\u201d recently, 31 men and women, among them a West African\u2028\ndiplomat, waited anxiously but in\u2028\nstony silence for Burombo to\u2028\nhand them their daily\u2028\nmedication.\u2028\nBuroinbo is one of several\u2028\nZimbabwean witchdoctors who\u2028\nhave announced a plethora. of\u2028\nherbal cures they hold as the answer to an epidemic that still\u2028\npuzzles the world\u2019s Lop medical\u2028\nresearchers.\nCritics say they are cashing in\u2028\non the ,Aida epidemic sweeping\u2028\nsouthern Africa. Independent analysts say about 800,000 people in\u2028\nZimbabwe\u2019s population of 10 mii-\u2028\nbon have tested positive to the\u2028\nHIV virus that causes advanced\u2028\nimmuno-deficiency syndrome.\u2028\nThe Zimbabwe government is\u2028\ntrying to prevent these claims\u2028\nraising false hopes among infected people and Aids sufferers.\u2028\nHealth authorities have ordered te8ta of the \u201cwonder\u201d herbs\u2028\nto see if they do what their makers claim.\u2028\n\u201cA sufferer from the HIV virus\u2028\nis highly vulnerable and is easily\u2028\nattracted to any claims for\u2028\ncures,\u201d health Minister Timothy\u2028\nStamps, himself a medical doctor, said.\u2028\n\u201cIf it goes unchecked, many\u2028\npeople will be made rich from the\u2028\nmisfortunes of other innocent\u2028\npeople,\u201d he added.\u2028\nStarting immediately, Stamps\u2028\nsaid, the government would demand to test Aids patients before\u2028\nthey were treated by\u2028\nwitchdoctors and again afterwards. Herbal concotions would\u2028\nalso be analysed locally and overseas for their effectiveness. \u201cWe\u2028\ndo not want another Kemron,\u201d\u2028\nStamp added.\u2028\nHe was referring to a Kenyan-\u2028\nmade drug unveiled in 1989 with\u2028\nmuch fanfare by its makers. It\u2028\nhas since been ruled as ineffective\u2028\nby the World Health\u2028\nOrganisation (WHO).\u2028\nBurombo, now arguably the\u2028\nmost famous of Zimbabwe\u2019s\ncountless witchdoctors, maintains\u2028\nhis own discovery is for real.\u2028\n\u201cLast week, I sent five\u2028\nZimbabwean patients back to the\u2028\nHealth Ministry for testing after\u2028\ntreatment. They had been re-\u2028\n(erred to me by the ministry. The\u2028\ntests proved they were totally\u2028\ncured, I have and I can cure Aids\u2028\n\u2014 no one can doubt that,\u201d he\u2028\nboasted.\u2028\nThere was no confirmation of\u2028\nthis from the ministry. The head\u2028\nof the state- funded Blair Re\u2028\nsearch Institute declined to dis\u2028\ncuss whether the five may have\u2028\nbeen cured and urged caution\u2028\nabout Burombo\u2019s claims. ,\u2028\n\u201cIn each trial \u2014 and we have\u2028\nseveral of these at the moment \u2014\u2028\nwe need 30 patients who we have\u2028\nto check and have regular reviews\u2028\non for at least six months to see if\u2028\nthe traditional cocktail works,\u201d\u2028\nDr Stephen Chandiwana said.\u2028\n\u201cI think people have to be cautious about claims by Burombo\u2028\nand other healers \u2014 as indeed\u2028\nwith any other claims,\u201d he said.\u2028\nChandiwana, whose institute is testing traditional herbs and\u2028\nmedicines on Aida, said some\u2028\nAids patients lived between five\u2028\nand 10 years after infection and\u2028\n\u201csome traditional healers may be\u2028\ntaking advantage of this fact.\u201d\u2028\n\u201cOur clinical trials and tests on\u2028\nthese herbs will take at least six\u2028\nmonths because we want to do\u2028\nthem in a scientific, systematic\u2028\nand proper manner. At the moment, we have no breakthrough,\u201d\u2028\nhe said.\u2028\nGovernment approval or not!\u2028\nBurombo says he has treated\u2028\nthousands of Aids patients since\u2028\n1985 and they keep pouring in\u2028\nfrom virtually all corners of the\u2028\nglobe.\u2028\nThis year alone, patients had\u2028\ncome from Britain, Botswana,\u2028\nthe United States, Canada, South\u2028\nAfrica and Germany, be said.\u2028\nBurombo said all his patient must first be tested for Aids in a\u2028\nmodem laboratory. He charges\u2028\nabout Sh2,200 for a 21-day treatment which involves drinking a\u2028\nconcotion of 47 herbs \u2014 17 from\u2028\nZimbabwe and 30 from Zambia,\u2028\n\u201cThe fees are really reasonable.\u2028\nIt\u2019s a lot of work going to Zambia\u2028\nand in and around Zimbabwe in\u2028\nsearch of these herbs,\u2019 he said,\u2028\ndeclining to name them.\u2028\nNow Burombo wants the government to help build a hospital.\u2028\n\u201cLook at all these people. I can\u2019t cope treating them here. It\u2019s\u2028\ntoo email. I need a proper hospital,\u201d he said, adding that on average, he got 50 new patients daily.\u2028\nBurombo is not a typical witchdoctor \u2014 the gaunt and secretive type that for centuries roamed the countryside in Africa\u2028\nthrowing bones to the bones to heal an ailment. Burombo\u2019s\u2028\npractice blends traditional healing and modern medical\u2028\nmethods.\u2028\nMost of his patients live in their homes or with friends or\u2028\nrelatives around Harare. But\u2028\nBurombo says he keeps an average 10 a week at his home-cum\nsurgery \u2014\u201cthose who are full-\u2028\nblown Aids cases and can\u2019t walk, eat or do anything.\u201d\u2028\nBut he refuses to discuss the\u2028\nmakeup of his potions and says\u2028\nhe will not send these for tests as\u2028\ndemanded by the government.\u2028\nBut he refuses to discuss the\u2028\nmake-up of his potions and says\u2028\nhe will not send these for tests as\u2028\ndemanded by the govern men\u2028\n\u201cOnce you disclose then\u2028\nsomeone cleverer than you may\u2028\nthen take up the cure and claim it\u2028\nis his,\u201d he said.\u2028\n\u2014 Reuters"}
