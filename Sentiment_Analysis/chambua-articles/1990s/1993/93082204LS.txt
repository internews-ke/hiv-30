{"text": "Impious Frisco and the price of infamy\nGive me a moment of your time and let me tell\nyou about the wicked city of San Francisco!\nSan Francisco has variously been known as\nthe home of the hippies, the home of the\nhighest concentration of brothels in the\nUnited States and the home of the highest\npopulation of homosexuals and lesbians. -\nIt is such a liberality With its gay bars and\npornographic stores and live nude shows that it is said that anything goes in San Francisco.\nThe City owes its dubious reputation to the\nfact that it came into being following the\ndiscovery of gold in the region.\nYoung men, many of them convicts loaded\nwith testosterone and ambition, gave life to\nthis sleepy town which started as an outpost\nof New Mexico.\nThe whores followed hot on their heels. It\nis a common joke that in those early days,\n'Frisco was governed by Pros and Cons. They\nwere the legislators formulating laws that\nstated that no man could be jailed for more\nthan 10 days, not even for murder, laws that\nstated that no policeman could step into a bar\nafter night fall. '\nProstitution and panning for gold were the\ntwo trades San Francisco had going for itself\nthen. People grew so rich and were so busy\nhaving a good time that they did not have\ntime for mundane tasks like washing their\nclothes - when they got dirty, they threw\nthem away or shipped the more expensive\nitems to laundries in China and Hawaii. They\nhad no time to wash clothes; people were\neither making money - or love. That was San\nFrancisco during the Gold Rush of 1849.\nSan Francisco has never shed its reputation\nof being a permissive city. On every street corner there is a bookshop offering hardcore pornography. On certain streets like Castro Street, gay men and women embrace openly as though to make a social statement, while prostitutes roam the streets with abandon.\n,Yet despite its smutty reputation, there is\nprobably no other American city that is as\nintensely beautiful as San Francisco. It is set\non a series of 40 hills overlooking the San\nFrancisco Bay. Grand homes line the streets\nand the city has well tended flower beds in\nwindow gardens and porches.\nWith a population density higher than any\nother area in the United States except for\nManhattan, San Francisco has a palpable\nenergy, a unique vibrancy.\nWalking through the streets of the city,\nthough, I was amazed at the number of\nhomeless people I saw. Young men often on\ndrugs and out of jobs and old men who just\ngot tired fill the bus terminals where they\n- sleep on the benches.\nLooking around I also felt a measure of concern for the children who have to grow up here. In one of the downtown neighbourhoods called Tenderloin, five children play on the pavement and on the road because there is not one single open space for them to play.\nYet there are several liquor stores and adult\nbookshops right at their doorsteps and drugs\nare sold at every other street corner.\nBut my greatest concern went out to the\ngay and lesbian community. Over 12,000\npeople have died of Aids since its outbreak.\nMost of these were gay men. It is estimated\nthat 40 to 50 per cent of the gay community is\nHIV positive. \n, A local TV station run a story on how many\nof the gay people are reverting to unprotected\nsex because they feel that they will\nget the disease anyway. A sense of fatalism\nand despondency 18, setting in and there is an\nair of sadness on Castro Street. Gone are the\neasy, carefree days: As I walk down the\nstreets, watching the lovers band in band, I'm\nreminded that life is often like a supermarket.\nYou can pick what you want from the selves,\nbut there is always a price to pay.\nAnd right now San Francisco is paying.\nHomelessness on the rise. City of contradiction and conflicts. Children with no playgrounds or schools, but where liquor stores and \"adult\" bookshops flourish."}
