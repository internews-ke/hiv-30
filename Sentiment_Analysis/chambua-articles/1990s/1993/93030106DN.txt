{"text": "March 1, 1993\n\nChjldren and the\u2028\n scourge of Aids\u2028\n It was on February 18 that this newspaper quoted Miss\u2028\n Jacinta Mwikali Maingi, the co-srdinatoi- of the Norwegian\u2028\n Christian Aid (NCA) organisation in Nairobi, as sayisg that\u2028\n the number of Aids cases among the city\u2019s street children\u2028\n was on the rise.\u2028\n She was qssted further as saying that failure by the\u2028\n Kenyan authorities to focus their attention on the plight of\u2028\n these children would greatly undermine the Goeernment\u2019s\u2028\n stated intention of curbing the spread of the disease in the\u2028\n country.\u2028\n Today we carry a story about seven abandoned children\u2028\n whose parente am believed to have died from the disease\u2028\n which is lOO per cent fatal. We are not suggesting that the\u2028\n children are carriers of the Aids-cauaing HlV virus, but we\u2028\n are saying that without parents and a source of livelihood,\u2028\n these children are likely to end up on the streets.\u2028\n Of cosme, Kenyans are aware thst the number of babies\u2028\n who are infected with the killer disease by their mothers\u2028\n during birth ia also on the increase. To get the enormity of\u2028\n the Aids pandemic, one needs only to recall that last month,\u2028\n we also reported that 18 per cent nf those Kenyans\u2028\n attending clinics for sexually transmitted diseases and 4.5\u2028\n percent of out patiente in public hospitals are HIV positive.\u2028\n The prognosis is shattering given the fact that Aids carriem\u2028\n da nst know they have the Sims and are healthy and\u2028\n sexually active until they start to see the symptoms.\u2028\n Available evidence also auggesto that more young girls are\u2028\n getting infected with the Aids-causing virus than are their\u2028\n male counterparts.\u2028\n Again, the revelation by Dr Elirabetb Ngugi, a lecturer at\u2028\n the Uniseraity of Nairobi\u2019a Community Health\u2028\n Department, last month that 21,665 Kenyans aged betwaen\u2028\n 15 and 44 contracted the disease between 1984 and 1992\u2028\n helps to underscore the fact that the Aids spread runs\u2028\n across the age spectrum, hut it in the young and those in\u2028\n their 40s who are most vulnerable.\u2028\n Let us faca it. Children are innocent The babies who are\u2028\n infected with the virus at childbirth know not what their\u2028\n parents were up to, but they have to live \u2014 no matter bow\u2028\n long or short that ia \u2014 with an inheritance in which they\u2028\n bad no say. The parente ought to have known better, but\u2028\n they did not for reasons which will obviously vary from one\u2028\n person to another.\u2028\n We are not in any way suggesting that children should be\u2028\n cared for better than the older Aids patiente. Far from it.\u2028\n What we are aaying is that up till now, there is not a policy\u2028\n on children who hsve been infected with tbe Aids virus be\u2028\n they with their parente or be they the so-called street\u2028\n children or those whose parents die from this scourge.\u2028\n One thing about our society is that it is llkely to\u2028\n stigmatise children whose parente die from Aida regandless\u2028\n of whether all the children are infected with the Aids virua\u2028\n or not. These children, as the seven we referred to above,\u2028\n are likely suffer the acorn and stigma that is associated with\u2028\n this disease. -\u2028\n As for the so-called street children, just as there is no\u2028\n policy about them, so also is the likelihood that there will be\u2028\n no concern about those with the MIV virus. They are likely\u2028\n to be treated with the contempt that is implied in the\u2028\n names of street children and street urchina or glue-sniffing\u2028\n parking hoys used to refer to them.\u2028\n The poiot we are advancing is this, though it is\u2028\n regrettable and a pity that the Ministry of Health is still\u2028\n trying to formulate a policy on Aids, it is nf profound\u2028\n importance that in our overell strategy to combat the\u2028\n dioease and care for ita victims, serious attention should be\u2028\n paid to the problem of children infected with the Aida-\u2028\n causing sinis and those whose parente die as a result of the\u2028\n disease.\u2028\n This cannot be left to non-governmental organisations\u2028\n and charitable grospa alone."}
