{"text": "Calculating cost of Aids\nThe Kenyan economy which\nhas been performing poorly\nfor some time now, is headed\nfor yet another crisis arising\nfrom the Aids pandemic.\nApart from the obvious human\nlosses, the economy is rapidly\nlosing potentially productive\nhuman resources in addition to\nincurring high medical expenses.\nBy January this year, about 33,000 Aids cases had been reported\nto the National Aids Control\nProgramme (NACP). It is\nestimated that for each case\nreported two others went\nunreported:\nThe cummulative number of\nAids up to January is thus estimated\nat around 100,000.\nTransmission of the Aids-causing\nvirus in Africa is largely\nthrough heterosexual (male/female)\ncontact which accounts for\nabout 75 per cent of the transmission.\nBoth vertical, mother to\nchild; and blood transfusion\naccount for about 5 to 10 per cent\neach.\nCurrent estimates indicate a\nprobability of between 25 and 45\nper cent of transmission of the\nAids virus from mother to child\nmainly during pregnancy and at\nbirth.\nIn Kenya, one may then say\nwith a high degree of accuracy\nthat for every three children born\nto mothers infected with the Aids\nvirus one will be infected.\nIncubation\nAids has a relatively long\nincubation period, which\ndistinguishes it from many other\ndiseases. During the incubation\nperiod, the health of the. patient\nis apparently normal. In Kenya,\nsuch a patient lives for about 8\nyears before he/she shows the\nsymptoms of full blown Aids, if\nhe/she is not a child. infants infected\nwith the virus rarely go beyond\nthe age of four.\nWhat makes the incubation period\nvery important is the fact\nthat the infected patient who often\nmay not know it, could easily\ntransmit the virus, mainly\nthrough heterosexual contact.\nAnother peculiar aspect of Aids\nis that once its symptoms have\nappeared, .the virus goes ahead\nwrecking the body's immunity\nsystem, thereby opening the door\nfor other diseases to attack and\nkill the patient.\nBy January, Kenya had about\n700,000 people aged 15 and\nabove, who were infected with\nHIV. Many of these people look\nquite healthy and could thus be\ntransmitting the virus over the\nnext couple of years.\nCurrently, the concentration of\nHIV infected people in the population\nis estimated to range between\n50 to 67 per cent in the\nrural areas, compared to urban areas on average.\nHowever, given that about 85\nper cent of Kenyan's population\nlives in rural areas, even this relatively\nlower concentration leads\nto a high absolute sum of those\ninfected among the rural\npopulation.\nHIV infection patterns in\nAfrica indicate that the 15 to 49\nage group is worst hit by the epidemic.\nHere in Kenya available\nstatistics underline this view.\nOut of about 33,000 Aids cases\nreported to NACP by January\n1993, 82 per cent were within the\n15 to 44 age group, and out of\nthese 85 per cent were in the 20\nto 44 age bracket.\nThese statistics have severe social-\neconomic implications. One,\nat age 15, one is expected to have\nreached standard eight of the\neducation ladder. Loss of such individuals\nafter education and\ntraining leads to \"brain drain\".\nTwo, between the ages 20 and\n44 years, we have a high concentration\nof employed people and\npeople undergoing on-the-job\ntraining who have internalised\nspecial skills. Within this age\nbracket output/labour ratios are\nhigh. Loss of individuals in this\nage bracket leads to loss of potential\nproductivity.\nThree, between the ages 20 and-\n49 years, we have a high concentration\nof parents with young children to take care of. Loss of these parents spells doom to the\nlives of these young children who\nneed parental love and care,\nleadership and guidance, and\nmaterial provision.\nAids orphans have to contend\nwith enormous problems. Many\nhave to do without education.\nProvision of basic necessities including\nfood, shelter and clothing\nbecomes a chronic problem. Lack\nof adequate care exposes many of\nthese orphans to diseases that\ncould easily be prevented.\nA combination of problems and\nlack of guidance and leadership\n, could lead many of these children\nto the streets, possibly engaging\nin activities that could fuel the\nAids pandemic.\nThe treatment of Aids is exorbitant,\nand will definitely become\na major strain on our public\nhealth budget. At the household\nlevel, previous resources will also\nbe consumed by the scourge.\nIn Kenya Aids medical costs\nare estimated at around Sh50,000\nper year, at current 1993 prices.\nThis compares badly with our\nper capita income. In 1991 our\nper capita income which stands\nat about Sh7,900 per annum.\nGiven the deteriorating economic\nperformance coupled with rising\npopulation our per capita income\nhas declined. Hence few Kenyans\ncan afford to seek private hospital\ncare for Aids. Rather the bulk\nof Aids patients will continue to\nrely on the public. health care system.\nGiven that we had about\n700,000 HIV positive patients\namong the 15 and above age\ngroup in January, we have a serious\nproblem even if we assume\nthat nobody else is infected.\nTo assist us in our analysis let\nus have a few simplifying assumptions.\nOne, that the 700,000\nHIV infected patients reach their\nterminal Aids stages in an evenly\nspread manner over the next ten\nyears. Two, only half the terminal\nAids patients seek in-patient\ncare. Three, non-terminal Aids\npatients receive minimal medical\ntreatment. Four, in-patient care\ncosts double the cost of out-patient\ncare.\nBased on these assumptions,\nwe can estimate the direct medical\ncost of Aids resulting from the\n700,000 individuals already infected.\nGranted that over the\nnext 10 years, terminal Aids cases\nwill be evenly spread, each year\nwe shall have 70,000 Aids terminal\ncases.\nOut-patient\nOut of this number 35,000 will\nseek in-patient care and the other\n35,000 will only seek out-patient\nhealth care. Given that currently\nour national health care system\nhas only about 34,000 beds and\ncots, it means that even if we discharge\neverybody else, we shall\nnot have enough room for half of\nthe terminal aids patients.\nGiven that it will take about\nSh50,000 at current 1993 prices,\nit means that 35,000 Aids in-patients\nwould require K\u00a387.5\nmillion, while the other 35,000\nAids patients seeking out-patient\ncare would incur K\u00a343.8 million.\nBased on these assumptions,\nthen direct medical costs involved\nin treating terminal Aids\ncases among the 15 and above age\ngroup, will be K\u00a3131.l million at\ntoday's prices.\nThis amounts to about 0.7 per\ncent of the 1992 Gross Domestic\nProduct (GDP), and 79 per cent\nof the 1992/93 Ministry of\nHealth's printed recurrent\nbudget.\nThe strain on the public health\nbudget might soon lead to the\nshifting of scarce resources from\npreventive and promotive to curative\nhealth care. However, even\ncurative health will not have\nenough resources, given the imbalanced\nnature of our public\nhealth recurrent budget, in\nfavour of personnel expenditure.\nApart from the medical bill, a\nlot of man-years of potential economic\nproductivity will be lost.\nMost of this will involve Aids patients\nin the 20 to 44 year age\ngroup.\nCalculations indicate that if\nthe trend continues, then from\nthis age group, Aids deaths will\nlead to a loss of an average of at least 26.3 potential years of productive\nlife, assuming life expectancy\nat birth to be 57 years.\nGiven that crude death rate in\nKenya stands at 37/1000, then\n2,590 out of the 70,000 reaching\ntheir Aids terminal stages would\nbe expected to die through other\ncauses even if there was no Aids.\nThus out of the 70,000 patients,\n67,410 would be expected to die\nannually strictly due to Aids for\nten years.\nAssuming the current pattern\nof AIDS cases among the population\ncontinues then 85 per cent of\nthe 67,410 expected to die each\nyear will be aged between 20 to\n44. This will lead to a loss of\nabout 1,506,964 man years per\nyear - assuming that life expectancy\nat birth and crude death\nrate do not change.\nIf we assume that labour productivity\nfor the 20 to 44 age\nbracket is equal to the 1990\nnational average, of Kenya\nK\u00a3426. at constant 1982 prices,\nand an average interest rate of 30\nper cent over the next several\nyears, then we can estimate the\ndiscounted value of GDP lost\neach year, for ten years, to Aids.\nEach year, the potential productivity\nlost to Aids from the 20\nto 44 year age group would be\nK\u00a381,283,215, equivalent to\nabout 2 per cent of the 1990\nGDP.\nConsidering that the average\nproductivity among the 20 to 44\nage group could be about double\ntl}e national average, one would\nthen estimate that about 4 per\ncent of GDP will be lost each\nyear. Combining this lost GDP\nwith the medical bills the total\nGDP loss will be 4.7 per cent. \nAids poster: Disease will strangle\nKenya's economy."}
