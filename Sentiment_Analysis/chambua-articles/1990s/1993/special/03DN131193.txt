Five million 'to die of Aids'
By NATION REPORTER
Researchers estimate that some
five million Kenyans will die of
Aids by the turn of the century.
A United Nations Development
Programme seminar was
told yesterday that five million of
Kenya's projected population of
35 million will have been wiped
out by the disease by the year
2000.
The seminar was organised for
Permanent Secretaries and was
held at a Nairobi hotel.
The one-day meeting chaired
by Mr Gaylord Avedi, a PS and
director of directorate of personnel
management, was aimed at
increasing awareness of the impact
of the Aids epidemic.
The organisers said it was a
special effort to engage opinion and
decision-makers and the
population in responding to the
epidemic in an informed and constructive manner.
A paper entitled the
"Machakos Declaration," which
was drafted after another UNDP sponsored
meeting in Machakos
this week, said that if the current
trend of Aids infection continued,
the country would need 80,000
extra beds for Aids patients.
This represented 20 hospitals
the size of Kenyatta National
Hospital, for Aids patients only.
Experts also estimated that 10
per cent of the adult population
was infected with the HIV virus.
They said the economy would
suffer the loss of many productive
and skilled workers.
The paper read by Mr Stephen
Karaba recommended the rehabilitation
of Aids victims' survivors
and the enactment of a law
to protect HIV sufferers from
discrimination.
