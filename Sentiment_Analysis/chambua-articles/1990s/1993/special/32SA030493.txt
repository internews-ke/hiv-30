More than 800,000 Kenyans are 
HIV-positive, the chairman of 
the National Aids Advisory Committee, Dr M.S. Abduilab, said 
yesterday. 
Dr Abdullab said Kenya bad 
300,000 Aids orphans. 
The human immuno-deficiency 
virus (HIV) is believed to cause 
the killer disease Aids. 
Dr Abdullah was awarding certificates to 15 nurses after a one 
 course on training people 
to care for HIV and Aids patients 
organised by the Aga Khan 
Foundation. 
He said spouses and relatives
of Aids patients must be trained 
on how to care for them at home 
so that the patients could live 
and die in their homes with the 
dignity they deserve. 
, Even if we doubled the number of hospital beds in the country, we could never accommodate 
all the Aids patients,” he said. 
He said a survey conducted ¡n 
Uganda, Tanzania and Zaire bad 
revealed that 50 to 60 per cent of 
hospital beds were occupied by 
Aids patients. 
“We have not conducted 
the survey here but the figures 
are likely to be the same because 
the environment is similar,” he 
said.
He advised HIV positjve 
people not to waste time pointing 
fingers at other people but to look 
to the future instead. 
Dr Abdullah urged society to 
change its attitude towards HIV 
positive and Aids patients. 
Meanwhile, the director of the 
Kenya Medical Research Institute, Dr Davy Koech, yesterday 
said the publicity given to foreign 
doctors who made unfounded 
statements on Aids in Africa after short visit may jeopardise efforts to control the killer disease. 
Dr Koech said should 
ignore “dangerous claims by a 
team of British and American 
medics that the NW virus that
causes  is “harmless 
“Some of these people are simply tourists and their irresponsible claims that HIV cannot cause 
an Aids epidemic  Africa  
be ignored and strongly rejected,” 
he said. 
In a related matter, a 
official in the Ministry of Heal. 
Dr P. Achola, this week warn 
Kenyans to ignore reports
