Belgian, MP decries IMF measures
By NATION Reporter
The Structural Adjustment Programmes
being undertaken in
most African countries will lead
to further marginalisation of the
African woman, the Member of
Parliament for Antwerp, Belgium, Mrs Marijke van
Hemeldonck, said yesterday.
"The harsh austerity measures
imposed by the IMF and World
Bank which demand massive reductions
in the health and social
services budget will severely affect
the African woman by increasing
her burden as provider
for the family," she said.
Mrs Hemeldonck said the programmes were being implemented
at a time when health budgets
should be expanded because of
the serious risks of infections due
to the Aids epidemic.
She was addressing the Press
at a Nairobi hotel during a brief
stop-over on her way to Botswana
for a European Economic
Community-African Carribean
and Pacific (EEC-ACP) joint
assembly.
Mrs Hemeldonck said some of
the UN conventions on the status
of women should be revised. She also called for the
strengthening of the 1974 UN
Declaration' on Violence against
Women and Children
