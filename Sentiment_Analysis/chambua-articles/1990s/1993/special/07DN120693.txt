Kemron efficacy questionable
Dr Koech's presentation of
Kemron to the world in 1990
prompted numerous studies on
the use of Kemron and other low
dose interferons in the management of Aids.
As a medical doctor, I have reviewed
13 studies using Kemron
or other low dose interferons in
Africa, North America, Europe
and Asia. None of the studies
have been able to reproduce the
striking beneficial effects as described
by Dr Koech and Prof Arthur
Obel.
None of them were able to
show zero conversion from a HIV
positive to a HIV negative state,
an increase in CD4 count or a
significant clinical improvement.
Dr Koech would want us to believe
that they are all wrong.
Instead of reviewing his methodology,
result its and going back to
the laboratory, Dr Koech opts to
engage in media campaigns discrediting
these studies while marketing this worthless and still experimental
produce. A true
researcher should accept and expect
criticism.
His public posturing through
the media are noted with great
concern. They are a constant
source of embarrassment to the
media and research fraternity.
Perhaps his not being a medical
doctor contributes to his insensitive
approach.
In sharing this disappointing
news, HIV infected persons are
encouraged to seek treatment
with therapies whose efficacies
have been established.
The hepatitis B virus, like the
Aids virus, also has no cure and
kills those inflicted. We now hear
from Dr Koech that Kemron can
remove the virus from the body.
Either Kemron is a true wonder
drug or a major fake. No guessing
where I'd put my money.
