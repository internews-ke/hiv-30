WHO defends Kenya on Aids
, By GEORGE OWUOR
The World Health Organisation
(WHO) has refuted claims that Kenya inflated Aids figures to win sympathy from the donor community.
The local WHO representative Dr Paul Chuke, said reports in The Sunday Times and Africa Corifidential - both based in London - that Kenya was trying to portray a serious health situation so donors would resume aid were baseless. "That report is totally false," he said. It was a sensational report.
Dr Chuke was speaking at a symposium in Nairobi for journalists.
The symposium was organised by the United Nations as part of the celebrations marking
the organisation's 48th anniversaty.
He said WHO had responded to health problems in Africa by establishing a special programme to deal with research on tropical diseases. 
Dr Chuke said the collative number of Aids cases in Kenya was 35,000, with some 750,000 people HIV positive.
