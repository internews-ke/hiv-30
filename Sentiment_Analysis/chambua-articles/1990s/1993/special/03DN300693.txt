Aids counsellor: attacked, robbed

MARTHA MBUGGUSS

A man who has tested HIV positive was attacked and his fingers 
broken when he went to distribute condoms in a Nairobi street.
‘Three men hit Mr Peter Wambia Kimani with a metal rod 
near Tusker House on Saturday 
night and stole his bag full of 
condoms and Aids literature. 
He lay in great pain for about 
fifteen minutes,” he said. He later went to the bus stop and caught a
matatu to ‘ his Kariobangi house’ 
He did not quite know how seriously hurt, he was until Sunday 
when his hand started swelling. 
He went to Kenyatta National 
Hospital where he was treated. 
‘Mr Kinani says his full time 
occupation, is to educate people about Aids. He is part of a group 
called Aid  Community  Based 
Outreach Services which counsels 
Aids sufferers. It also teaches 
“safe sex by using’ condoms: 
Mr. Kimani spreads his message mainly in night’ clubs and
back streets ‘which he says are 
likely places for the spread of 
Aids. Mr Kimani counsels people 
by first of introducing himself 
as an Aids victim. He then goes on to urge them not to have careless sex! 
 
He depends on we1lwishers or those he ta1ks to t give him o
money for bus fare and house rent.

Before he was declared-HIV 
positive, Mr Kimani ‘used to run
a small business in Kibera employing nine girls where he ‘made 
popcorn: and ‘crisps. 
He could not get a medical certificate to enable him to get a 
licence for the business after he was found to be HIV positive. 

“I have since used all my savings on: Kemron)” he says. 
Mr Kimani was born ‘in 
Nairobi’ in 1959 He is separated’ 
from his wife who, with their two. 
children, are HIV: negative.
