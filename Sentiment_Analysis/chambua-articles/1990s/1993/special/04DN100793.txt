TB killing three million annually'
By NATION Correspondent
Tuberculosis accounts for the largest number of dealthsattributed to a single disease, the World
Health Organisation representative in Kenya, Dr
Paul Chuke, said yesterday.
Dr. Chuke said the disease, previously believe to be under control, presently causes three million deaths each year worldwide.
"A sense of urgency is created by the return
TB 'Which we all thought was at last disappearing 
and its comeback is linked to HIV infection, he
said. '
Dr Chuke was speaking on· on "Tuberculosis
and HIV Infection, Medical and Social Economic
Aspects' at an Aga Khan Health Services organised talk at a Nairobi hotel.
The WHO said, TB was a disease of poor people 
immigrants and wartime refugees, "but the disease 
now afflicts people from all walks of life".
"If someone has dormant TB infection and his
immunity is depressed as in the case of Aids, [the silent TB bacteria] will be re-activated an
progress to full-blown clinical TB," he said while
explaining the relationship between TB and Aids
He said only 10 per cent of those people exposed
to TB suffered the disease while the others overcame and contained it.
He said in the developing countries, TB infection comes before the HIV one and remains dormant until the body's immunity is lowered. 
He added that HIV patients who also have … do not seem to respond well to TB treatment and side effects are more common in such patients.
"There is also speculation that TB accelerates
the progression of HIV infection to severe clinical
Aids," he added;
