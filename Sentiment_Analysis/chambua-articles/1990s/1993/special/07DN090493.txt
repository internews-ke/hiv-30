OCTOBER 28, 1993
New Aids discovery
PARIS 
French researchers said that they 
had discovered the gateway 
through which the Aids virus 
penetrates and infects blood cells, 
a discovery that could lead to the 
development of a vaccine to lock 
the virus out. 
The Pasteur Institute team 
said it had discovered a “co-receptor” molecule, named, 
used by all strains of the Aids 
virus to gain entry. 
Aids researchers have known 
for several years that the HIV virus latches onto a receptor molecule called CD4 on the surface of 
some blood cells. 

“But we did not know how the 

virus got inside the cell to contaminate it,”  Dr Ara 

Hovanessian, who headed the 

Pasteur Institute’s research team. 

The group’s findings were to be 

presented yesterday at an Aids 

conference outside Paris. 

Researcher Robert Gallo of the 

National Institute of Health in 

Bethesda, Maryland in the USA, 

said the findings appeared to be a 

‘very exciting, very stimulating 

step” in Aids research. (AP)
