{"text": "Kemron efficacy questionable\nDr Koech's presentation of\nKemron to the world in 1990\nprompted numerous studies on\nthe use of Kemron and other low\ndose interferons in the management of Aids.\nAs a medical doctor, I have reviewed\n13 studies using Kemron\nor other low dose interferons in\nAfrica, North America, Europe\nand Asia. None of the studies\nhave been able to reproduce the\nstriking beneficial effects as described\nby Dr Koech and Prof Arthur\nObel.\nNone of them were able to\nshow zero conversion from a HIV\npositive to a HIV negative state,\nan increase in CD4 count or a\nsignificant clinical improvement.\nDr Koech would want us to believe\nthat they are all wrong.\nInstead of reviewing his methodology,\nresult its and going back to\nthe laboratory, Dr Koech opts to\nengage in media campaigns discrediting\nthese studies while marketing this worthless and still experimental\nproduce. A true\nresearcher should accept and expect\ncriticism.\nHis public posturing through\nthe media are noted with great\nconcern. They are a constant\nsource of embarrassment to the\nmedia and research fraternity.\nPerhaps his not being a medical\ndoctor contributes to his insensitive\napproach.\nIn sharing this disappointing\nnews, HIV infected persons are\nencouraged to seek treatment\nwith therapies whose efficacies\nhave been established.\nThe hepatitis B virus, like the\nAids virus, also has no cure and\nkills those inflicted. We now hear\nfrom Dr Koech that Kemron can\nremove the virus from the body.\nEither Kemron is a true wonder\ndrug or a major fake. No guessing\nwhere I'd put my money.\nCharles Maringo, (Dr),\nNlirobi."}
