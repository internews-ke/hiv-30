Ndichu's Aids call criticized
By NATION Reporter
Juja MP Stephen Ndichu was
criticised yesterday for his suggestion
that the Government
should confine AIDS patients in
a special home.
The executive director of Know Aids Society, Mr Joe Muriuki, said in a Press statement that the call was disturbing since the implication was
to deny people their constitutional
right of free movement and
association.
Mr Ndichu said in Parliament
on Thursday that it would be better
to confine Aids patients instead
of asking their relatives to
take them home just so that
space could be created for the
treatment of non-Aids patients.
Mr Muriuki argued that such a
move would make people infected
with the HIV virus feel insecure
and isolated.
He said Mr Ndichu should be a
protector of people's basic rights.
Aids may be incurable but was
manageable and "no one should
write off people on account of
HIV infection as Mr Ndichu suggests.
