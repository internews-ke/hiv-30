Calculating cost of Aids
The Kenyan economy which
has been performing poorly
for some time now, is headed
for yet another crisis arising
from the Aids pandemic.
Apart from the obvious human
losses, the economy is rapidly
losing potentially productive
human resources in addition to
incurring high medical expenses.
By January this year, about 33,000 Aids cases had been reported
to the National Aids Control
Programme (NACP). It is
estimated that for each case
reported two others went
unreported:
The cummulative number of
Aids up to January is thus estimated
at around 100,000.
Transmission of the Aids-causing
virus in Africa is largely
through heterosexual (male/female)
contact which accounts for
about 75 per cent of the transmission.
Both vertical, mother to
child; and blood transfusion
account for about 5 to 10 per cent
each.
Current estimates indicate a
probability of between 25 and 45
per cent of transmission of the
Aids virus from mother to child
mainly during pregnancy and at
birth.
In Kenya, one may then say
with a high degree of accuracy
that for every three children born
to mothers infected with the Aids
virus one will be infected.
Incubation
Aids has a relatively long
incubation period, which
distinguishes it from many other
diseases. During the incubation
period, the health of the. patient
is apparently normal. In Kenya,
such a patient lives for about 8
years before he/she shows the
symptoms of full blown Aids, if
he/she is not a child. infants infected
with the virus rarely go beyond
the age of four.
What makes the incubation period
very important is the fact
that the infected patient who often
may not know it, could easily
transmit the virus, mainly
through heterosexual contact.
Another peculiar aspect of Aids
is that once its symptoms have
appeared, .the virus goes ahead
wrecking the body's immunity
system, thereby opening the door
for other diseases to attack and
kill the patient.
By January, Kenya had about
700,000 people aged 15 and
above, who were infected with
HIV. Many of these people look
quite healthy and could thus be
transmitting the virus over the
next couple of years.
Currently, the concentration of
HIV infected people in the population
is estimated to range between
50 to 67 per cent in the
rural areas, compared to urban areas on average.
However, given that about 85
per cent of Kenyan's population
lives in rural areas, even this relatively
lower concentration leads
to a high absolute sum of those
infected among the rural
population.
HIV infection patterns in
Africa indicate that the 15 to 49
age group is worst hit by the epidemic.
Here in Kenya available
statistics underline this view.
Out of about 33,000 Aids cases
reported to NACP by January
1993, 82 per cent were within the
15 to 44 age group, and out of
these 85 per cent were in the 20
to 44 age bracket.
These statistics have severe social-
economic implications. One,
at age 15, one is expected to have
reached standard eight of the
education ladder. Loss of such individuals
after education and
training leads to "brain drain".
Two, between the ages 20 and
44 years, we have a high concentration
of employed people and
people undergoing on-the-job
training who have internalised
special skills. Within this age
bracket output/labour ratios are
high. Loss of individuals in this
age bracket leads to loss of potential
productivity.
Three, between the ages 20 and-
49 years, we have a high concentration
of parents with young children to take care of. Loss of these parents spells doom to the
lives of these young children who
need parental love and care,
leadership and guidance, and
material provision.
Aids orphans have to contend
with enormous problems. Many
have to do without education.
Provision of basic necessities including
food, shelter and clothing
becomes a chronic problem. Lack
of adequate care exposes many of
these orphans to diseases that
could easily be prevented.
A combination of problems and
lack of guidance and leadership
, could lead many of these children
to the streets, possibly engaging
in activities that could fuel the
Aids pandemic.
The treatment of Aids is exorbitant,
and will definitely become
a major strain on our public
health budget. At the household
level, previous resources will also
be consumed by the scourge.
In Kenya Aids medical costs
are estimated at around Sh50,000
per year, at current 1993 prices.
This compares badly with our
per capita income. In 1991 our
per capita income which stands
at about Sh7,900 per annum.
Given the deteriorating economic
performance coupled with rising
population our per capita income
has declined. Hence few Kenyans
can afford to seek private hospital
care for Aids. Rather the bulk
of Aids patients will continue to
rely on the public. health care system.
Given that we had about
700,000 HIV positive patients
among the 15 and above age
group in January, we have a serious
problem even if we assume
that nobody else is infected.
To assist us in our analysis let
us have a few simplifying assumptions.
One, that the 700,000
HIV infected patients reach their
terminal Aids stages in an evenly
spread manner over the next ten
years. Two, only half the terminal
Aids patients seek in-patient
care. Three, non-terminal Aids
patients receive minimal medical
treatment. Four, in-patient care
costs double the cost of out-patient
care.
Based on these assumptions,
we can estimate the direct medical
cost of Aids resulting from the
700,000 individuals already infected.
Granted that over the
next 10 years, terminal Aids cases
will be evenly spread, each year
we shall have 70,000 Aids terminal
cases.
Out-patient
Out of this number 35,000 will
seek in-patient care and the other
35,000 will only seek out-patient
health care. Given that currently
our national health care system
has only about 34,000 beds and
cots, it means that even if we discharge
everybody else, we shall
not have enough room for half of
the terminal aids patients.
Given that it will take about
Sh50,000 at current 1993 prices,
it means that 35,000 Aids in-patients
would require K£87.5
million, while the other 35,000
Aids patients seeking out-patient
care would incur K£43.8 million.
Based on these assumptions,
then direct medical costs involved
in treating terminal Aids
cases among the 15 and above age
group, will be K£131.l million at
today's prices.
This amounts to about 0.7 per
cent of the 1992 Gross Domestic
Product (GDP), and 79 per cent
of the 1992/93 Ministry of
Health's printed recurrent
budget.
The strain on the public health
budget might soon lead to the
shifting of scarce resources from
preventive and promotive to curative
health care. However, even
curative health will not have
enough resources, given the imbalanced
nature of our public
health recurrent budget, in
favour of personnel expenditure.
Apart from the medical bill, a
lot of man-years of potential economic
productivity will be lost.
Most of this will involve Aids patients
in the 20 to 44 year age
group.
Calculations indicate that if
the trend continues, then from
this age group, Aids deaths will
lead to a loss of an average of at least 26.3 potential years of productive
life, assuming life expectancy
at birth to be 57 years.
Given that crude death rate in
Kenya stands at 37/1000, then
2,590 out of the 70,000 reaching
their Aids terminal stages would
be expected to die through other
causes even if there was no Aids.
Thus out of the 70,000 patients,
67,410 would be expected to die
annually strictly due to Aids for
ten years.
Assuming the current pattern
of AIDS cases among the population
continues then 85 per cent of
the 67,410 expected to die each
year will be aged between 20 to
44. This will lead to a loss of
about 1,506,964 man years per
year - assuming that life expectancy
at birth and crude death
rate do not change.
If we assume that labour productivity
for the 20 to 44 age
bracket is equal to the 1990
national average, of Kenya
K£426. at constant 1982 prices,
and an average interest rate of 30
per cent over the next several
years, then we can estimate the
discounted value of GDP lost
each year, for ten years, to Aids.
Each year, the potential productivity
lost to Aids from the 20
to 44 year age group would be
K£81,283,215, equivalent to
about 2 per cent of the 1990
GDP.
Considering that the average
productivity among the 20 to 44
age group could be about double
tl}e national average, one would
then estimate that about 4 per
cent of GDP will be lost each
year. Combining this lost GDP
with the medical bills the total
GDP loss will be 4.7 per cent.
