{"text": "Aids conference\nIs major step\nThe Aid conference, which begins in Nairobi tomorrow, is\na major positive step in the war against the lethal infection\nthat is threatening the survival of millions of people.\nThe conference, to be attended by Aids sufferers as well\nas people with no clinical symptoms, but who carry the\nHuman Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), is important for\nOne  areas . Although 1.68 million Kenyan carry the virus,\nwith 34,0 0 either suffering from Aids or in the throes of\nthe final stages of the infection, most people still claim they\ndo not know, or have not heard, about anyone with the\ninfection. In other words, Aids is, in \u00b7many ways, still a\ncloset disease .\nTop officials at Afya House, the Ministry of Health\nHeadquarters, say the conference will - using ,the\nexperiences and ideas of victims, including members of the\nKnow Ai Society (KAS) - examine the stages of the\nepidemic n Kenya.\nOne sure thing is that Kenyans have failed to curb the\nspread of Aids and this calls for a critical analysis and\nevaluation of the causes of this tragic failure.\nIndeed, there are various dimensions to the problem and\nvery few in our in the country can escape blame. Parents\nhave failed to help protect their children from the infection.\nAids is, in fact, said to be rampant among teenagers.\nEqually iS , our youth should no longer look for scapegoats\nand the lesson is now clear. Sex outside marriage and\npromiscuity are a sure way to death.\nFirst recorded in 1984, the rapid spread of Aids is a major\nindicator hat Kenyans have to seriously examine their\nmorals. I deed, we agree with a senior official in the\nMinistry ho said that there was an urgent need to reexamine\nthe whole issue of morality because it has been\nlacking among our leaders - politicians, religious men,\ncommunity leaders or clan leaders and even the medical\nprofession.\nUnless the rate of spread of the killer disease is curbed _\nits infection and death rate at least doubles every six\nmonths - he country will soon be plunged into a major\ndisaster because Aids has major socio-economic, cultural,\nlegal and political implications that portend doom.\nThere is no doubt that an Aids test is already becoming\nan important requirement for those who have been sexually\nactive be\u00a3 e marriage, especially if they want children.\nLike all others, most of 1.68 million people infected with\nHIV simply took their \"chance\". Even if the country's top\nmedical experts confess that they have been shocked and\ncaught unprepared by the rapid spread of the infection.\nAn organization like Unicef, which specializes. in\nchildren's issues, has been forced to re-examine its\nstrategies or activities and seriously join the war against the\nkiller disease, which is wrongly assumed to affect only\nsexually active adults. ,\nIndeed, it is Unicefs country representative, Mr Vincent\nO'Reilly, who recently warned against curbing the funding\nof Aids progammes because the disease can rapidly retard\nall the progress that has been made in the war against\npoverty an diseases.\nAs parents die, leaving thousands of orphans, at least 30\nper cent of children born by mothers with HIV also get\ninfected du . g or before birth and their. number is rapidly\nincreasing. Aids even hinders immunisation against\ntuberculosis\nThere is need for strategies to help curb the killer\n'disease, which afflicts seven per cent of our population and\nreaches 30 per cent among some adult groups.\nThe KAS has done a good job in the war against Aids.\nHowever, it is a shame that some hotels have been\ndiscriminating against Aids sufferers, probably out of\nignorance. perhaps the Nairobi conference will help to\neducate the about the spread of the virus. Employers in\nKenya definitely need training on the handling of HIV and\nAids victims."}
