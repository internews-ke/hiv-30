Healthy babies cast doubt on Aids testing in Africa
From PAUL REDFERN, Nation,
Correspondent, ·London 
An investigation by the Sunday
Times newspaper which started
in a Nairobi hospice for HIV children
has again .cast doubt on HIV
testing in :Africa as well as the links HIV has with Aids 
The investigation by the newspapers 
correspondent Neville
Hodgkinson begun at the
Nyumbani hospice for abandoned
and orphaned HIV positive
children.
Despite predictions that most
of these children would have died
within a year, all but one are alive
and well. Some, who were originally
diagnosed as HIV positive
are now HIV negative. Others despite
remaining HIV positive
· have put on weight and appear
healthy.
· Father Angelo. d'Agostino, a
former surgeon who trained as
a Jesuit priest and became professor
of psychiatry in Washington
before coining to Africa 10 years
ago is the founder of the hospice.
According. to the  Sunday
Times, Father d'Agostino, "in
common with' growing numbers
of scientists and doctors around
the world, is beginning to question
whether HIV really is· the
killer it has been made out to be.
"He like them suspects that
many 'Aids" cases are really old
diseases given a new name and
that people who test HIV-positive
are not, as most have been
led to believe, the victims of a
new inevitably lethal disease.
"I'm a physician and I bought
the theory that HIV is. the cause
of Aids," .he told the Sunday
Times. "But it is surprising. We
expected a lot more deaths and a
lot more serious illness .
"According to most predictions,
the children should have
died within two to three months
of coming to us. Instead, we have
now had to set up a nursery
school and I'm planning to negotiate
their entry into primary
school.
"I had been preparing to establish group therapy for the mothers
to deal with their grief at the
loss of the children. Instead, the'
only losses..the hospice has are
happy ones: some of the children
become HIV -negative and are
taken back by relatives or ordinary children's homes." .
This is not the first time the
Sunday Times newspapers had
cast doubt on HIV testing in
Africa and indeed the links with
Aids. But its - views alongside
· those of a minority of the medical
profession are still regarded as
heresy by the World Health Organisation (WHO).
WHO maintains that thousands
of children die annually because
of Aids and that eight million
people across Africa .are
infected and that 500,000 a year will be dying by the year 2000.
But most children who are diagnosed
as HIV positive are automatically abandoned by their relatives
and health officials as
having no hope, the Sunday
Times says. As a result the children
are killed "by multiple infections,.
malnutrition and misery 
rather than by Aids."
Some explain that some HIV,
positive babies later test negative
because they were never truly virus-
infected but instead inherited their
mothers antibodies· to HIV
which fade with time;
But mothers too are being misdiagnosed
and doubts are growing
as to the efficiency of the HIV
tests--across Africa..
Other critics doubt the accuracy
of the statistics which are being
correlated on Aids and HIV
infection because of the difficulty
of getting hold of such
information.
The Sunday Times points out
that extensive medical investigation
into Aids in Africa during
the early to mid 1990s led to initial
claims that there were 5 million
HIV-infected people on the
continent.
"Lurid predictions followed,
Such as one newspaper claim that within 10 years., Aids would leave
vast areas of now-populated land
devoid of a single living person.
"The tests that led to those estimates
are now admitted to have
been unreliable, producing a high
proportion of false positive results.
Newer tests are said to be
more accurate but according to a
recent review in the journal, Bio
Technology, none has yet been
scientifically validated.
"The article showed that multiple,
non-specific assaults on the
immune system, which are extremely
common in Africa as a
result of poverty, prostitution
and the breakdown of medical
and· social services, may be causing
millions to test positive when
they are not infected with HIV."
In an interview with Dr Hedvig
Pelle, the WHO co-ordinator for
the Kenya National Aids Control
Programme, she said that Aids
was "widespread and increasing.
My colleagues. in other countries
can tell you the same.
"However if you come with
this postulate that there are a lot
. of false HIV-positive, it is very
difficult to tell."
The Sunday Times concludes
by saying that "political factors appears to play a part in determining whether a (country has a
major Aids Problem or not.
Kenya lost an estimated £200
million in desperately needed
foreign currency in November
1991 when the industrialised
world decided' to try to force political· and economic reform on
the country by cutting aid.
"A recent crisis .announcement
on Aids by the country's 'health
minister is seen within the international aid community as an attempt
to win back donor funds."
And what is the secret of the
success at the Nyumbani hospice?
That, according to Sister 
Mary Owens, is. entirely down to
the TLC(Tender Loving Care)
factor. "Their whole experience
in the home is one that makes
them happy children." .
And as for the future? Father
d'Agostino had few doubts: "Will
they (the children be alive) next
year? I have no reason to doubt
it; they are healthy.
"They. are very sick when they
come to us. But as a result of the
care here, they put on weight, recover
from their infections and
thrive. Hygiene is excellent. Nutrition
is very good. They are
really flourishing

children - after getting Tender Loving Care - test negative
