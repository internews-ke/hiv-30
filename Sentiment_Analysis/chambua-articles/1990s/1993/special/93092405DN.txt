{"text": "Healthy babies cast doubt on Aids testing in Africa\nFrom PAUL REDFERN, Nation,\nCorrespondent, \u00b7London \nAn investigation by the Sunday\nTimes newspaper which started\nin a Nairobi hospice for HIV children\nhas again .cast doubt on HIV\ntesting in :Africa as well as the links HIV has with Aids \nThe investigation by the newspapers \ncorrespondent Neville\nHodgkinson begun at the\nNyumbani hospice for abandoned\nand orphaned HIV positive\nchildren.\nDespite predictions that most\nof these children would have died\nwithin a year, all but one are alive\nand well. Some, who were originally\ndiagnosed as HIV positive\nare now HIV negative. Others despite\nremaining HIV positive\n\u00b7 have put on weight and appear\nhealthy.\n\u00b7 Father Angelo. d'Agostino, a\nformer surgeon who trained as\na Jesuit priest and became professor\nof psychiatry in Washington\nbefore coining to Africa 10 years\nago is the founder of the hospice.\nAccording. to the  Sunday\nTimes, Father d'Agostino, \"in\ncommon with' growing numbers\nof scientists and doctors around\nthe world, is beginning to question\nwhether HIV really is\u00b7 the\nkiller it has been made out to be.\n\"He like them suspects that\nmany 'Aids\" cases are really old\ndiseases given a new name and\nthat people who test HIV-positive\nare not, as most have been\nled to believe, the victims of a\nnew inevitably lethal disease.\n\"I'm a physician and I bought\nthe theory that HIV is. the cause\nof Aids,\" .he told the Sunday\nTimes. \"But it is surprising. We\nexpected a lot more deaths and a\nlot more serious illness .\n\"According to most predictions,\nthe children should have\ndied within two to three months\nof coming to us. Instead, we have\nnow had to set up a nursery\nschool and I'm planning to negotiate\ntheir entry into primary\nschool.\n\"I had been preparing to establish group therapy for the mothers\nto deal with their grief at the\nloss of the children. Instead, the'\nonly losses..the hospice has are\nhappy ones: some of the children\nbecome HIV -negative and are\ntaken back by relatives or ordinary children's homes.\" .\nThis is not the first time the\nSunday Times newspapers had\ncast doubt on HIV testing in\nAfrica and indeed the links with\nAids. But its - views alongside\n\u00b7 those of a minority of the medical\nprofession are still regarded as\nheresy by the World Health Organisation (WHO).\nWHO maintains that thousands\nof children die annually because\nof Aids and that eight million\npeople across Africa .are\ninfected and that 500,000 a year will be dying by the year 2000.\nBut most children who are diagnosed\nas HIV positive are automatically abandoned by their relatives\nand health officials as\nhaving no hope, the Sunday\nTimes says. As a result the children\nare killed \"by multiple infections,.\nmalnutrition and misery \nrather than by Aids.\"\nSome explain that some HIV,\npositive babies later test negative\nbecause they were never truly virus-\ninfected but instead inherited their\nmothers antibodies\u00b7 to HIV\nwhich fade with time;\nBut mothers too are being misdiagnosed\nand doubts are growing\nas to the efficiency of the HIV\ntests--across Africa..\nOther critics doubt the accuracy\nof the statistics which are being\ncorrelated on Aids and HIV\ninfection because of the difficulty\nof getting hold of such\ninformation.\nThe Sunday Times points out\nthat extensive medical investigation\ninto Aids in Africa during\nthe early to mid 1990s led to initial\nclaims that there were 5 million\nHIV-infected people on the\ncontinent.\n\"Lurid predictions followed,\nSuch as one newspaper claim that within 10 years., Aids would leave\nvast areas of now-populated land\ndevoid of a single living person.\n\"The tests that led to those estimates\nare now admitted to have\nbeen unreliable, producing a high\nproportion of false positive results.\nNewer tests are said to be\nmore accurate but according to a\nrecent review in the journal, Bio\nTechnology, none has yet been\nscientifically validated.\n\"The article showed that multiple,\nnon-specific assaults on the\nimmune system, which are extremely\ncommon in Africa as a\nresult of poverty, prostitution\nand the breakdown of medical\nand\u00b7 social services, may be causing\nmillions to test positive when\nthey are not infected with HIV.\"\nIn an interview with Dr Hedvig\nPelle, the WHO co-ordinator for\nthe Kenya National Aids Control\nProgramme, she said that Aids\nwas \"widespread and increasing.\nMy colleagues. in other countries\ncan tell you the same.\n\"However if you come with\nthis postulate that there are a lot\n. of false HIV-positive, it is very\ndifficult to tell.\"\nThe Sunday Times concludes\nby saying that \"political factors appears to play a part in determining whether a (country has a\nmajor Aids Problem or not.\nKenya lost an estimated \u00a3200\nmillion in desperately needed\nforeign currency in November\n1991 when the industrialised\nworld decided' to try to force political\u00b7 and economic reform on\nthe country by cutting aid.\n\"A recent crisis .announcement\non Aids by the country's 'health\nminister is seen within the international aid community as an attempt\nto win back donor funds.\"\nAnd what is the secret of the\nsuccess at the Nyumbani hospice?\nThat, according to Sister \nMary Owens, is. entirely down to\nthe TLC(Tender Loving Care)\nfactor. \"Their whole experience\nin the home is one that makes\nthem happy children.\" .\nAnd as for the future? Father\nd'Agostino had few doubts: \"Will\nthey (the children be alive) next\nyear? I have no reason to doubt\nit; they are healthy.\n\"They. are very sick when they\ncome to us. But as a result of the\ncare here, they put on weight, recover\nfrom their infections and\nthrive. Hygiene is excellent. Nutrition\nis very good. They are\nreally flourishing\n\nFather d'Agostino and some of the Nyumbani children join other guests in admiring a tankard presented to\nthe priest after he won the Guinness Stout Effort Award recently for his work at the home. Most of the HIV positive\nchildren - after getting Tender Loving Care - test negative"}
