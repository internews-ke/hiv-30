{"text": "200 women sex spree\nof an actor f with Aids\nBy a Correspondent\nA: Hollywood actor had sex with more than 200 women even though he knew he was carrying the Aids virus.\n.\u2022 The revelation has led to Ray Sharkey, 40, who died from the disease last month, being branded \"the most evil man in Hollywood\". -\n\u2022Days before his death, he broke down and admitted: \"I've done things that are terribly wrong. I'm so, so sorry.\" Sharkey appeared in the TV series Wiseguy and movies such as The Idolmaker, Ganglands and Scenes From The Class Struggle In Beverly Hills. His estate is being sued for massive amounts by two women he allegedly infected, and many more claims are expected.\n'Elena Monica, the 27-year-old daughter of a Los Angeles\ncomedian, is claiming $40 million.\n,A 30-year-old graphic designer from Beverly Hills - who\nidentified herself only as Joyce - claimed that she too had been infected by Sharkey.\nShe said she had an on off relationship with the\nmarried actor starting in1985.\nHe was tested HIV positive in 1989 but kept the result a secret.\nJoyce found out she was infected when she had a test after being tipped off that she might be at risk.\n\"I had just got back from lifting weights in the gym and had never felt so healthy in my life,\" she recalled.\n\"I asked Ray if he had the virus. He came over, hugged me, and denied it. \nHe said, \"Don't tell anyone. It could ruin your career\" .\nShe said she did not want to believe that she had caught the virus from Sharkey, even though he had told her of his hundreds of lovers.\n\"The thing about it which really angers me is that this is not about one man going around killing people,\" she said. It is about a system of people who for their own selfish, self-serving reasons, had something to benefit from by keeping their mouths shut while I died.\"\nSharkey's agent, Herb\nNanas, said: \"Ray's dead\nand I don't give a damn\nabout the issue any more.\nRay had sex with a lot of\nwomen and 99 per cent of\nthem are fine.'\nAsked about the other one per cent, he said\nSharkey had assured him\nhe would never have\nunprotected sex.\nSharkey's widow  Carole,\nwho is not infected, said\nhe would not have\nmaliciously infected his\nlovers.\n\"May be he transferred\nhis drug addiction to a\nsexual addiction,\" she said.\n\"When a person is\nfamous, they tend to think\nthey are exempt from the consequences of adultery\nand everything else.\" ,\nWhile staying in' Palm Springs during one of the\nlast weekends of his life,\nSharkey broke down for\n,the first time and\nexpressed remorse about\nhis sexual misdeeds.\nHe tried telephoning\nsome of his lovers, begging\nthem to forgive him, and\neven tried to become\nreconciled with two\nwomen he had condemned\nto death.\nRay Sharkey: Branded the\nmost evil man in Hollywood\n\nKabaselleh's new tune\nto fight a deadly plague\nBy WILLYS OTIENO\nSinger Ochieng' Kabaselleh is on\nan entertainment mission with a\ndifference in Kisumu District.\nThe popular musician is\nperforming at various market\ncentres in the district to draw\nawareness to the dangers of Aids.\nKabaselleh and his Luna Kidi\nBand better known for\ncaptivating songs such as\nZainabu, Achi Maria and\nWuora Ogola has been\ncontracted to perform at four\nvenues per division - trading\ncentres, disco halls, agricultural\nshows etc.\nThe performances, part of a\nUnicef Aids project, primarily\ntarget the youth who after the\nshows are lectured on the dangers\nof Aids.\nKisumu is' believed to have one\nof ,the highest HIV incidence.\nThe project is meant to pass\ncorrect information on Aids and HIV infection among the youth,\npopularise the, use of condoms\nand discourage cultural practices\nthat have high potential for HIV\nspread.\nKabaselleh's role is to attract\ncrowds with his music while\nvarious speakers talk on Aids.\nAfter the performance condoms\nare distributed to the audience.\nThe strategy is said to be\nbearing fruit.
