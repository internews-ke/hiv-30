{"text": "Aids: Ultimate challenge for the communicators\nAids is being described as the\nultimate challenge to\ncommunicators.\nIn its coverage of the first decade\nof the disease, the mass media'\nconcentrated on news from\nmedical experts, research institutions\nand regional or international\nconferences in major urban\ncentres.\nNow, even top medical experts\nare reminding communicators\nthat they have an urgent duty to\neffectively inform the public\nabout Aids and this involves going\nbeyond mere creation of\nawareness.\nProfessor Lobe Monekosso,\nthe World Health Organisation\n(WHO) director for Africa region,\nlast week said that \"a reliable\nanti-Aids vaccines is not\nreally in sight and thus, personal\nand communal efforts which promote\ngood sexual behaviour, including\ncondom use, should be\nemphasised even in schools in order\nto protect the youth.\"\nProfessor T. Vilma, who runs\nan ultra modem molecular biology\nlaboratory at the university of\n. California, testing. some of the\nemerging genetically engineered\nAids vaccines, said that the\nspread of Aids is linked to ignorance\nand people should be effectively\nprovided with appropriate\ninformation on the simple preventive\nmeasures.\nIn other words, the mass media\nis being asked to change and focus\non activities, knowledge and\nbeliefs of \"ordinary\" people. The\nmedia should pay attention to\nanti-Aids activities in villages,\nclans, slums, theatres, schools\nand among\u00b7 various groups, including youth, women, prostitutes and others who usually\nmake little or no news.\nStill, it has been realised that\nthe war against Aids will only be\nwon by the youth.\nThere should be more news on\nsteps being taken by the youth to\nprotect themselves against Aids.\nThe Kenya Boy Scouts, with\n200,000 registered members, is\none such group which first formulated\nFamily Life Education\nin 1989, expanded its activities\nand, last July, begun initiating\nAids intervention projects.\nThe KSA potential cannot be\nignored because it has up to\n300,000 unregistered members\n,which means it can reach half a\nmillion young people with appropriate\nmessages.\nHowever, the local media may\nnot know Kenya's young people\nfirst like to listen to their peers.\nThe emphasis of the scouts is on\nthe positive outlook rather than\nspreading of fear' or shock when\ndealing. with Aids. The positive outlook that the\nscouts dwell on includes the dissemination\nof information which\nshows that it is very easy to avoid\nthe disease, for it can be checked\nif enough people practiced safe\nsex which includes the use of\ncondoms.\nThey are also involved in\ncaring for Aids victims and are\nreminded that the disease is not\ncontagious despite the fear it\nevokes in many a people.\nIn Kenya, reports have always\nplaced prostitutes at the top of\nthe high risk groups and said that\ninternational tourism and prostitution\nrings are basically responsible\nfor the arrival and initial\nspread of the Aids\u00b7 virus whose\ncarriers are now 1 million.\nHowever, the mass media never\npaid close attention to the activities\nor human interest stories\non prostitutes and Aids. Indeed,\nthis was made clear when a team\nof local journalists visited hot\nnight spots in Mombasa to witness\nsome of behaviours linked to\nthe spread or curbing of the\ndisease.\n'The use condoms has become\nwidespread among prostitutes\nwho frequent Mombasa's night\nspots. It has become fashionable\nto carry condoms, but the girls\ncomplain that local men do not\nseem to mind unprotected sex.\n. However, some of the prostitutes\n that drinking and use\nof drugs by some people led them\ninto disregarding the use of\ncondoms. They said that visiting\nseamen, troops, and naval officers\nuse condoms and have also\nbeen officially warned against indiscriminate\nsex unlike in the\npast when they were let loose.\nIn other words, instead of the\nmedia quoting experts on prostitutes\nthere is room for \"inside\"\nstories from the women or their\nclients which can have an impact\non the behaviour of the readers.\nIn Kisumu District, Unicef has\nencouraged a group of commercial\nsex workers (read those who\nengage in commercial sex) to disseminate\nappropriate messages\non Aids\u00b7 and the HIV virus that\ncauses it through theatre, songs,\npoems and dance. Some of the\nladies have already formed drama\ngroups and stage plays in markets,\nsocial halls and bars which\nsend powerful messages to audiences.\nCommercial sex workers talking\nabout the use of condoms and mentioning some of their members\nwho have been killed by\nAids, have become credible messengers\nin this particular\ncommunity.\nKisumu District is, indeed, a .\nbeehive of anti-Aids activities\nwhich are based on social\nmobilisation. Here also audio-visual\nmaterials have been translated\ninto local languages.\nThe Nyawita Youth Group, for\nexample, is clearly proving that\nwell designed messages have an\nimpact. Some of their performances\nimitating actual beliefs\nand activities of the community\nwhich help spread Aids leave audiences,\nincluding the illiterate,\nswearing to help curb the spread\nof Aids.\nMusic plays a major role in the\nsocial life of most individuals and\nin western Kenya, Ochieng\nKabaselleh has included important Aids messages in his popular\nnumbers ...\nHis band is also accompanied\nby medical personnel on its tours\nand apart from him singing about\nAids, during a break or when\nthere is a full house, the people\nhave time to ask questions.\nThese activities recently attracted\nthe attention of communication\nand medical experts\nfrom Senegal, the US, Egypt\nHonduras, Cote d'Ivoire, South\nAfrica and Kenya who attended\nUnicef's Technical- Support\nGroup on Mass Mobilisation for\nYouth Health and Development.\nThe group visited Buoye Primary\nSchool in Kisumu where\nsongs and drama about health\nwere performed. But, the\nKochieng Primary Health Care\n(PHC) project is a clear indicator\nthat the war against Aids will\nfinally be won when individuals\nand communities are convinced\nto act.\nThe Kochieng PHC project is\none of the 26 communities implementing\nthe Bamako Initiative\nwhich also ensures that community\npharmacies have adequate\nessential drugs sold at affordable\nprices for the members apart\nfrom practical initiation of preventive\nmeasures including clean\nwater, impregnated mosquito\nnets and latrines that curb the\npopulation of flies.\nThe Bamako Initiative centres\nare also involved in maternal\nchild health and immunisation.\nHowever,. Aids prevention has\nbeen added to the list and apart from providing information' _\nthe disease, the pharmacies also\nhave condoms for distribution.\nProf Monekosso said last week\nthat \"there is a strong move towards\ncollaboration among UN\nagencies and Unicef provided the\ninitial funding for the Bamako\nInitiative which. are active centres\nof village or community\nhealth care activities.\nAt the Kisumu meeting, experts\nfrom South Africa said that\nthe country which is at political\ncrossroads is also struggling to\ncurb the rapid spread of Aids but\nstill lacks an implimentation\nplan.\nCote d'Ivoire, which is also one\nof the hardest hit nations in the\nAfrican region, has a mass communication\nprogramme to\nmobilise primary school pupils\nand youth organisations, especially\nyoung women and girls, in.\nvocational training institutions.'\nIn Egypt, the number of people\ninfected with the Aids virus.'\nstill reported to be below 500,\nthere are efforts to boost public\nawareness so that the disease and\nthe spread of it are not taken for\ngranted ..\nHonduras is said to have a relatively\nhigh proportion of Aids\ncases when compared to other\nLatin American nations and the\nmass communication and\nmobilisation programme will involve\nincreased awareness about\nthe causes of Aids, sexuality and\nyouth rights, with special attention\nto gender differences.\nIn this region the \"Macho\nMan\" syndrome remains widespread\nand it has direct and indirect\nnegative effects on anti-Aids\ncampaign strategies. In Senegal,\nthere are plans to promote decision-\nmaking capacities of the\nyouth to enable them to take actions\nwhich help curb the spread\nof the disease.\nUnicefs mass communication\nand social mobilisation\nprogramme .involves close co-operation\nwith journalists and this\nalso includes the African Council\nfor Communication Education\nwhose headquarters is in Nairobi.\nMass communication and social\nmobilisation form a major\nstrategy that is just evolving. The \nother major effort in the war\nagainst Aids involves the biomedical research which is designed to\nfind effective treatment or cure\nfor Aids. __\nThis has so far resulted in new\ndrugs, substances and at least 23 -\nvaccines designed to fight the virus that damages the body's immune system.\nIn our next installment we shall\nexamine the SEl81'Ch for an Aids\ncure and the latest on the discoveries of drugs. \n\nIn this second installment of his four-part update on the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (Aids), Science Editor OTULA OWUOR looks at some of the activities facilitated by Unicef and the World\nHealth Organisation to help curb the spread of the disease."}
