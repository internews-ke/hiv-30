{"text": "FRIDAY, DECEMBER 10, 1993\n\nSpare a thought for children\n\nNow that moat schools are\u2028\nclosed for the holiday\u2028\nseas\u00f4n, youngsters will\u2028\nbe spendin more time in front of\u2028\nthe television. It is hoped . that\u2028\nprogrammers keep in mind the\u2028\nyounger minds as they schedule\u2028\nthe month\u2019s line up of shows. Of\u2028\ncourse a good amount of time\u2028\nduring the day-time schedule is\u2028\nreruns of the week\u2019s evening pro\u2028\ngrammes. The trend in the past\u2028\nweek or so haz been to increase\u2028\nthe number of day-time movies\u2028\nand to schedule films that are\u2028\nchild-oriented. . \u2018\u2028\nAn example of such a film is\u2028\nOrphan Train, screened on\u2019KBC\u2028\nlate on Saturday night (which no\u2028\ndoubt . means it will be repeated\u2028\nduring_the week in an afternoon\u2028\nslot). This was a story of the or\u2028\nphans (street . children) of New\u2028\nYork City in the 1890s. One cou-\u2028\n. rage\u00e7us woman at a church mie\u2028\nsion braves ber own life and repu\u2028\ntation to try to resettle the\u2028\norphans in a better environment\u2028\n\u201cout West,\u201d hopefully on farms -\nanything woula be better than\u2028\nthe squalor of a big city. This je a\u2028\nCharles Dickens - type story with\u2028\nplenty of children performing.\u2028\nThough set in another cntury\u2028\nand in another place, the message\u2028\nis very applicable in today\u2019s world\u2028\nwhere it seems that orphans, the\u2028\nelderly, the mentally ill and the\u2028\ndiseased are often shunned by so\u2028\nciety. .\u2028\nA similar film Was screened on\u2028\nKTN last week. Sx Weeks was\u2028\nabout a young adolescent girl who\u2028\nis suffering from leukemia. Dud\u2028\nley Moore atare as a politician in\u2028\nCarlifornia who is more or less\u2028\nswept off his feet by the teenage\u2028\nprima dona whose lifetime\u2028\ndream is to perform in ballet, The\u2028\nNutcracker Suite. Some good\u2028\ncharacter development made this\u2028\nsomewhat entertaining, but the\n\noverall approach to marriage and\u2028\nfamily waa disappointing.\u2028\nSiniilarly, Forbidden Ni9hts\u2028\non the Friday night movie wae a\u2028\nlove story set in China in the\u2028\n1980e. An American teacher and\u2028\na young Chinese man fall in love\u2028\ndespite the rigid social order,\u2028\ncommunist control and dict\u00e4tor\u2028\n5hrtainiy The Cat &o,n O\u2019uter\u2028\nSpace has been screened more\u2028\nthan a half-dozen times on KTh,\u2028\nbut children never seem to tire of\u2028\nthis and similar Walt Disney\nmovies designed specifically for\u2028\nthem. There is never any fear of\u2028\ncontent or uijurioue images in a\u2028\nWalt Disney filin.\u2028\n\u2018Round Midnight was a very\u2028\ncreative film about African-\u2028\nAmerican jazz musician Dale\u2028\nTurner. This film would not ap\u2028\npeal to children as it is rather\u2028\nslow-moving. The poignant bio\u2028\ngraphical story very subtly devel\u2028\nops around the tenor saxophone\u2028\nplayer\u2019s struggle apinat alcohol\u2028\nand heroin addiction. Much of\u2028\nthe musician\u2019s life was spent in\nPans (to avoid the peddlars of\u2028\nNew York) where a young French\u2028\nman is so enamored by Tuzner\u2019g\u2028\ninnovative jazz that he takes bim\u2028\ninto his family and away from the\u2028\nexploitation by the proprietors of\u2028\nthe Blue Note cale (which actual-\u2028\nIy used Turner as their main\u2028\ndrawing card). Much of the dia\u2028\nhe is in French.\u2028\ntribute to Dale Turner.\u2028\nWorld Aids Day was noted on\u2028\nKBC with two documentaries\u2028\nHIV: Preventtng the War fo\u2028\ncused on Aids in Zambia and in\u2028\nIndia. It would seem, from these\u2028\nfocal pointa, that many govern\u2028\nments have n\u00f2w taken serious\u2028\nprevention tactics since they\u2028\nhave discovered that the disease\u2028\nattacks the age group which com\u2028\nprises the main work force in\u2028\nthese (and other) countries.\u2028\nChanges was a short film\nabout Aids in Kenya. The theme\u2028\nwas th\u2019at of preventing Aids\u2028\nthrough clean living and the use\u2028\nof condoms. This was a very ex\u2028\nplicit show with interviews with\u2028\nhealth and social workers who ex\u2028\nplained how and why to use\u2028\ncondoms. The fiLm also used a\u2028\nacare approach by showing\u2028\npe\u00e7ple suffering from the disease\u2028\nand their various symptoms and\u2028\nunhealthy appearance, but over\u2028\nall, it was a positively informative\u2028\nfilm (highly recommended for\u2028\nyoung people).\u2028\nKBC\u2019s continuing Thea (re\u2028\nSpec4ai recently screened A Mat\u2028\nter Qf the Heart. This was a bit\u2028\nfar-fetched as far as plot is con\u2028\ncerned \u2014 a young woman falls in\u2028\nlove with a newspaper vendor\u2028\nand of course must 1eep this rela\u2028\ntionship a secret because of their\u2028\ndiffering classes. The resolution\u2028\nis even more difficult to believe.\u2028\nHowever, the senes la well worth\u2028\nwatching as it offers some creative approaches to filming of locale in Kenya.\u2028"}
