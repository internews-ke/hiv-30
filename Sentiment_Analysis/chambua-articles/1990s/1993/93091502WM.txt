{"text": "Effect of rape on victim and the need to assist\nBy Prof DAVID M. NDETEJ\nSo far in this series we\nhave examined the definition\nof rape, described\nthe characteristics of\nrapists and last week\ntouched on the complications of\nrape on the rape victims. We discussed\nin some details a complication\nwe referred to as ''posttraumatic\nstress disorder\"\n(PTSD) in which the victim of\nrape relives every now and then\nthe experience she went through\nin the process of rape especially if\nshe encounters reminders of that\nexperience ..\nApart from PTSD some women\nmay have difficulties in resuming\nnot only normal sexual\nrelationships, but also difficulties\nin relating in a trusting relationship\nwith members of the opposite\nsex even when there is no\nsexual relationship. Some are so\nfearful of any sexual relationship\nthat they cannot relate with their\nspouses. Indeed only a few women\nemerge from the assault completely\nunscathed. The manifestations\nand the degree of damage\ndepend on three variables:\n\u2022 The degree of violence of the\nattack.\n\u2022 The personality of the\nvictim.\n\u2022 The help and support available\nto her immediately after the\nattack: As already mentioned earlier,\nthe degree of the violence\ncan have several components:\nThe amount of force applied\nphysically on her and the degree .\nof physical injuries sustained.\n\u2022 The degree of the threatened\nviolence: If a death threat is given, then this has inherently more\nviolence than the mere threat to\nbeat her, especially if she feels\nstrong enough to stage a fight if\nall he threatens to do is to beat\nher up.\n\u2022 The type of weapons used in .\nthreatening her: The use of a gun\nis in itself threatening and definitely\nmore threatening than the\nuse of fists. So is the use of a\nknife.\nThe humiliation that also accompanies\nthe attack such as\nforcing objects into her private\nparts or doing other humiliating things on her body. These were\ndiscussed last week. Other types'\nof humiliation include slapping her\nin front of her own children or\nwhile other people watch ..\nThe personality of the rape victim\nis important in the sense that\ndifferent personalities have different\ncoping capacities. There\nare some people who by their own\nnature, have\u00b7 difficulties in coping.\neven with relatively minor stresses\nand upsets of life. Rape is a\nmajor upset and therefore the\nmore vulnerable victims will develop\nmore complications than\nthe stronger and less vulnerable\npersonalities. There are also\nsome people who by their nature\nare timid, predisposed to depression,\nare withdrawn even without\nany stress at all. The help and\nsupport the rape victim gets after\nthe attack will determine to a\nlarge extent the long term complications\nof that attack. The victim,\nwho receives immediate support\nand is able to ventilate her\nfear and rage to loving family\nmembers, or to sympathetic professionals or to sympathetic law\nenforcement agents, will fare far\nmuch better than those who cannot\nget such support.\nShe is helped when she knows\nthat she has socially acceptable\nmeans of recourse at her disposal,\nsuch as the arrest and conviction\nof the rapist. She will be more\npredisposed to complications if\nshe believes people will ridicule\nher if she talks about it, that nobody\nwill take her seriously, that\nthe law enforcement agents will'\nnot act fast enough, or if she believes\nthat even after taking all\nthe trouble to get the attacker go\nthrough the process of. law, the\nsentence given out will be so\nshort as not to act not only as a\ndeterrent to him against future\nattacks, but also to other potential\nrapists.\nThere is nothing that can be\ndone to compensate her for the\ninjury' than putting him away or\ndeterring others in the sincere\nhope that it will not happen\nagain. The constant fear that it\ncan happen again can be more\ntormenting than the actual experience\nshe went through 'in the\nactual attack. The law enforcement agents need to be educated\non the psychological impact of\nrape and how to handle rape victims\nso that more victims feel encouraged\nto report this crime. It\nis perhaps better to have police\nwomen rather than policemen\nhandling these cases not because\nthey will enforce the law any better\nthan the men.. but because\nthey will facilitate communication\nand empathy with the\nvictims.\nIn most countries, there are\nvarious pressure groups that\nspeak out on the issue of rape.\nThere is one such group in this\ncountry and its formation is a'\nmost welcome dev1elopment towards\nnot only fighting rape, but\nproviding a forum for rape victims\nto articulate their experiences\nwith the sure hope that\nsomebody else will speak on their\nbehalf.\nThere is also the :place for the'\nprofessional, not only in articulating\nthe trauma of rape but in.\nlooking after those who have developed\ncomplications arising out\nof rape experiences ..\nPTSD is a particularly distressing condition, which is a\nclinical entity on its own and which requires tailor prescribed\nmanagement depending on the\ndegree of severity, the person involved\nand the circumstances in\nwhich the attack: took place.\nEssentially in the management\nof PTSD the aim is to help the\nperson overcome and live above\nthe experience of the attack so\nthat the person does not continue\nto relive those attacks. It is like\nhelping a person to live with the\nfact that he has lost a close and\nbeloved one and that life must go\non and for that as' normally or as\nnear normal as possible. When\nsexual problems arise as a result\nof the attack then treatment is\ntargeted at the E:exual problem\nwith a view to resolving it towards\nnormality ..\nBesides these psychological aspects\nto the management of rape\nthere are other aspects of management\nthat are purely physical ..\nTreatment of any physical injuries\ngoes without saying, so there\nare periodic tests to test for the\nAids virus (HIV)\nThese days HIV in rape situations\nis an important issue with\nspecial legal implications especially\nif the rapist knew that he\nwas HIV positive.\nMrs Fatuma\" Anyanzwa founder of the anti-rape organisation:\nShe provides a' forum for rape victims."}
