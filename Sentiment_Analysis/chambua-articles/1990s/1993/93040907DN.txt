{"text": "Condoms crucial in anti-Aids fight\nI would like to clarify a few points\nraised by writer Wangui Gachie\nin her recent article on the effectiveness\nof condoms in preventing\nthe transmission of the HIV\nvirus.\nNumerous scientific studies\nthroughout the world have shown\nthat the latex condom, if used\nproperly, is an effective barrier\nagainst sexually-transmitted diseases,\nincluding Aids. The\ncondom's efficacy against unwanted pregnancy is also well;\ndocumented.\nThe condom, as she pointed\nout, is not perfect. However, for\npeople who are unwilling or unable\nto abstain completely from\nsexual relations, the condom is\n'the next best option to prevent\nHIV transmission.\nA recent study by the United\nStates Food and Drug Administration\n(FDA), in which a machine\nwhich duplicated the\nstresses of sexual intercourse to\ntest whether viruses would leak\nthrough the pores of a stretched\nlatex condom was used, found\nthat men who do not use\ncondoms are at least 10,000 times\nmore exposed to HIV transmission than those who do.\nSafer (not safe) sex is better\nthan unprotected sex. Advising\npeople not to use condoms because\nthey are not foolproof is\n\u00b7like advising people in malaria\nendemic areas not to sleep under\n\u00b7nets. The condom forms an important part of any Aids prevention\nprogramme and should be\n, encouraged. Caroline Blair,\nProject Officer- Aids,\nUnicef."}
