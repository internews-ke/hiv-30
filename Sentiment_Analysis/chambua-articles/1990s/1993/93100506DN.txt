{"text": "Tuesday, October 5, 1998\n\nAids: Our time\u2028\n is running out\u2028\n If Kenya were to lone 80,000 people over the next two or\u2028\n three yearn as a result of tribal attacks, the country would\u2028\n be up in armo, the Government would be in serious danger\u2028\n and there would he calla for UN intervention. In fact, there\u2028\n have been about 1,000 deaths - according to some reporta -\u2028\n from thin cause over the last two years and our fervent hope\u2028\n is that will be the end of it But even that figure shocks and\u2028\n haunts Kenyans.\u2028\n Why, then, are we nut similarly traomatised when high\u2028\n officialo toll uu we wilt lose 80,000 of our fellow countrymen\u2028\n by t995-96, bot the killer will not be bows, arrows, pesgas\u2028\n or rungua, hut the Aids viras?\u2028\n Sadly, we suspect that Kenya, like many high-risk areas,\u2028\n has reached the point where it mentally turno off when the\u2028\n great killer disease, the Bubonic Plague of the 20th century,\u2028\n is mentioned. \u2018We didn\u2019t atari it, we don\u2019t propagate it, we\u2028\n can\u2019t stop it\u201d seema to he the cay. In it not time we started\u2028\n confronting reality? -\u2028\n One of the moot chilling stories carried by the Notion\u2028\n yesterday was a warning by the Permanent Secretary is the\u2028\n Ministry of Health that in two or three years every hospital\u2028\n bed in the country could be occupied by a dying Aida\u2028\n patient. What the PS actoslly said waa that 800,000\u2028\n Kenyans are HIV positive and if only 10 per cent nf these\u2028\n develop full-blown Aids, there in no way the hospitals can\u2028\n care for them. We have after all, only 45,000 bedo.\u2028\n As a heart-stopping postscript, he added that the whole\u2028\n of the Health Ministry\u2019s budget could go for Aida treatment\u2028\n in the nest seven yeare. Think back to where you were,\u2028\n what you were doing seven yearn ago. Not too long, in it?\u2028\n Now move forward seven years and consider: If you or your\u2028\n pscento or children are sick, they w\u00efll not get a hmpital bed\u2028\n becsuse it is occupied by an Aida victim, with another\u2028\n corpse-to-be poised to clamber into the still-warm sheets.\u2028\n Fer nobody aurvives Aids.\u2028\n Of course it will not happen quita like that Hospital\u2028\n treatment of Aida victimo in 199t cost 5h5.5 biffins and will\u2028\n coat st least ShlS.S billion by the year 2000 \u2014 money that\u2028\n will never be found. The living dead by then will routinely\u2028\n be turned away to die at home without the benefit of pain-\u2028\n relieving drags or professional care- By then every village,\u2028\n every community will have its quota of Aids skeletons.\u2028\n From being s family tragedy, Aids will have exceeded the\u2028\n dimensions of s national tragedy to become s national\u2028\n disastar.\u2028\n Consider some mom statistics: There will be 300,000\u2028\n orphans of the Aids dead by the year 2000; 14 per cent of\u2028\n pregnant women treated in Nairobi haapitala now are 111V\u2028\n positive (in 1985 the figure was 2 per cent); in Homa Bay\u2028\n diatrict one Aida victim is buried every weekend and in the\u2028\n whole of Nyanus and Western provinces 12,000 Aids cases\u2028\n have bees registered since t966; there are at least 1,150 s\u2028\n year in the Rift Valley province and Coast province hes\u2028\n notched ap 62,000 cases.\u2028\n An ta the effect on the national economy, 6 per cent of\u2028\n 111V positive casen nationwide are in the high-productivity\u2028\n age group between the years 15 and 49. it baa been\u2028\n calculated that Kenya lesea Sht million every time an\u2028\n employee with s Bachelor\u2019s degree dies of Aids.\u2028\n Clearly the Aids pandemic, with its orphsnu, depesdants,\u2028\n care coats and depredation of the work force in undermining\u2028\n social cohesion and threstening economic wellbeing st a\u2028\n time when we ace striving simply to keep afloat This in ta\u2028\n e, nothing of the emotional coata caused not only by lose\u2028\n of loved ones but that the lone is to Aida, the disease whicb\u2028\n brands the victim in the eyes of the righteous with a merel\u2028\n mark of Cain.\u2028\n In seeking a solution, or st leant en amelioration of the\u2028\n Aids scourge, let meral condamnation be our first target\u2028\n Let us leave \u201csin\u201d eut of our vscabulary. Thin horror could\u2028\n happen to any One of es.\u2028\n Practically, it in time foe a multi-aecterel sassait,\u2028\n involving Government, religieua inatitationa, NOOn,\u2028\n neighbourhood groupa, donors, acbeola, individuals, drama\u2028\n groupa, the media Every means should be employed to\u2028\n csmmunicate the dangers of Aids, including sex instruction\u2028\n in schools. Mentors, patenta and leaders should ruthlessly\u2028\n set aside their traditional embarrsaameat when it comes to\u2028\n talking about see and net out the plain facta.\u2028\n Dangeross cuatoms such ea wife inheritance, polygamy\u2028\n end child marriage should be closely examined and the\u2028\n protective mensures ahosid be illuminated for the young\u2028\n Fidelity itt a relationship, abstinence oc at the very least\u2028\n condoms.\u2028\n Aids is not something that is going to go awsy soon.\u2028\n Then ia nu sign of e cure and moat people muet assume it\u2028\n will be with them fur the rest of their senuelly active lives.\u2028\n Let us get to grips with it before it geta to grips with us,"}
