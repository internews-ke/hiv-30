{"text": "Some people 'may be immune to Aids\nFROM PAGE 1\nwant to identify or establish in\ncollaboration with the University\nof Mannitoba in Canada, Dr\nPlummer added.\nDr Plummer was reacting to\nreports from London which\nquoted the British newspaper\nThe Guardian as saying that scientists\nb Kenya have found what\nthey believe are 25 cases of natural\nimmunity to the human Immune\nDeficiency Virus (HIV).\nHe said the story was basically\ncorrect and his team plans to\nstudy the HLA.\nHowever, Dr Davy Koech, the\ndirector of the Kenya Medical\nResearch Institute (KEMRI),\nwho is an expert on how the immune\nsystem works, said the observation\nis not new.\nHe said there have been several\ncases of spouses who were exposed\nto Aids virus by infected\nspouses who ended up dying but\nthe partners are still alive and\ntesting negative six years later.\nDr Koech said that KEMRI is\nstudying up to 163 HLA cases\nwhile the National Cancer Institute\nin the US has experts studying up to 530. \"What we are talking\nabout must be understood to\nmean innate or natural immunity\nand not immunity which people\nacquire after being exposed to the\nvirus. It is not a question of going\nout to get the lethal virus in order\nto get the immunity,\" he warned.\nDr Elizabeth Ngugi, who works\nto rehabilitate the prostitutes in\nMajengo, recently told the\nNation that \"there may be hope\nif what was being observed\namong some of them turned out\nto be a reality,\" .\nBoth Dr Koech and Dr\nPlummer said the finding could\nlead to a laboratory replication of\nthe natural immunity in order to\ndevelop a vaccine against the killer\ndisease that so far has no cure.\nHowever, an expert who requested\nanonymity said the\nchances of having people with\nnatural immunity against the virus\nis zero because the infection\nrate among the group of Majengo\nprostitutes is nearly 99 per cent\nand with a thorough analysis and\ninterpretation of the data collected,\nthe infection could reach 100\nper cent."}
