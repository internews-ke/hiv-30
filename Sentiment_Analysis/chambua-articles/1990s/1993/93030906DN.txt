{"text": "Tuesday March 9 1998\n\nIn funding, Aids\u2028\n should be special\u2028\n The recent call by the local representative of Unicef, Mr\u2028\n Vincent O\u2019Reilly, that Aids should he treated as an\u2028\n emergency development problem and programmes to\u2028\n control the killer disease not be sobjected to some of the\u2028\n donor condicions or demands coald not have come at e\u2028\n more appropriate time.\u2028\n Kenya\u2019s Aids control programme has received much of its\u2028\n financial and material support from donnes and last week\u2019s\u2028\n reports that organisations charged with the task nf\u2028\n educating the peuple shout this danger were running out of\u2028\n funds dus ta dwindling donar support is worrying indeed.\u2028\n This state of affsirs has came ahoat os account nf the very\u2028\n heavy reliance the local Aids control programme has on\u2028\n foreign donors. It is, therefore, vital that the Government,\u2028\n Iscal nsn-governmentaJ groups and related organisations\u2028\n begin injecting money and other resources into the\u2028\n prngramme.\u2028\n For the last two yeam, there have been several reports\u2028\n that the National Aida Control Programme was facing a\u2028\n financial criais linked not only ta the dwindling donor\u2028\n aupport bat also to bureaucratic delays within the Ministry\u2028\n of Health.\u2028\n In attempting ta streamline the channelling nf funda to\u2028\n the right projects, it has been suggested that the Aida\u2028\n contrsl programme he placed under one nf the divisions in\u2028\n the Ministry. Our view is that this could he disastrous\u2028\n herauae Aida is not just \u201canother\u201d disease. The fight against\u2028\n it does nut leave room for the kind of laxity all too often\u2028\n found in many government departments.\u2028\n As Mr O\u2019Reilly saya, unless anti-Aida campaigns are\u2028\n intensified, the disease may reversa much of the progreso in\u2028\n the fields of health, education and 50cm-economic\u2028\n development that Kenyans \u2014 and indeed the world \u2014 still\u2028\n take fnr granted. Aida prevention is, therefore, an\u2028\n emergency programme. It ahould he treatad as such and\u2028\n handed accordingly.\u2028\n This means that donors have to re-examine moat of the\u2028\n direct and indirect \u201cstrings\u201d they attach to the funding of\u2028\n Aida prevention programmes, eopecially in education and\u2028\n awareness. These two areas ara vital because after five\u2028\n yeam of vigorous campaigning, many Kenyana seem to have\u2028\n given up the fight and are ignoring the dangers poaed by the\u2028\n Aida-cauaing virus.\u2028\n The tnfl already speaks fnr itself. In some parta of Kenya,\u2028\n eapecially Nyanza, unshakeable beliefs and customs\u2028\n worsened by ignorance, made communities asoume that\u2028\n Aids was not a new disease, hat \u201cchira\u201d which is\u2028\n traditionally a wasting ailment afflicting those who\u2028\n seriously violate societal norms or tahona.\u2028\n More trouble in on the way. Expects waro that within\u2028\n four years, at least 30fl,000 children may become Aida\u2028\n orphana. What is more, the name children sed others nf\u2028\n their age will he entering the sexually active teenage years\u2028\n without a proper grasp of the devastating impact nf the\u2028\n disease.\u2028\n We hope that Parliament will take the inane of Aida more\u2028\n senuusly and that legialatom will allocate more resources\u2028\n sad take time to join anti-Aids campaigns is their\u2028\n conatituencies.\u2028\n Churches, too, have a major anti-Aids campaign role to\u2028\n play especially in caring foc and counselling the victims\u2028\n because, as we have always said, we need each other in this\u2028\n fight."}
