{"text": "Vaccination urged to keep silent scourge at bay\nBy HENRY AMBWERE\nAND OCHIENG' RAPURO\nBrian, a brilliant student, who was just about to\nsit for his Kenya Certificate\nof Secondary Education\n(KSCE) believed\nthat the stomach ulcers that had pestered him for many years had been worsened by anxiety caused\nby exam fever. His condition worsened and he\nwas admitted to the intensive\ncare unit to the Nakuru War Memorial\nHospital The situation\ngrew even worse and Brian went\ninto a coma with liver failure.\nDetermined to save Brain's\nlife, his school, together with his\nparents joined forces and arranged\nfor his airlifting to one of\nthe top hospitals in the city. But\nhe did not make it. Brian was\npronounced dead as the air ambulance\ntouched the tarmac. The\npostmortem revealed that Brian\nhad been suffering from Hepatitis\nB.\nAccording to Dr Frederick\nOkoth, a liver specialist at the\nKenya Medical Research Institute\n(KEMRI), Hepatitis B is responsible\nfor 80 per cent of all\nliver cancers and killed as many\npeople as Aids.\nIn Kenya, Hepatitis B is responsible\nfor 80 per cent of all liver cancers.\nThe disease is most common\nin Turkana, where as many as 30\nper cent of the population show\nsigns of past or present infection.\nIt is estimated that another 10\nper cent (If the population were\nHepatitis B carriers and could infect\nother people.\nThe signs for Hepatitis B are\nyellow eyes (jaundice) and dark\nyellow urine. Victims also lose weight and appetite. They sometimes\ndevelop fever and swollen\nlower limbs.\nIf these signs are observed beyond\nseven days, the patients\nmight recover completely, become\na carrier or develop cancer\nof the liver cancer or liver cirrhosis.\nHepatitis B is a progressive\ndisease that is transmitted\nthrough the exchange of a variety\nof bodily fluids but mainly\nthrough transfusion of blood and\nblood products, sexual intercourse,\ncontaminated needles or\nother body piercing objects, and\nfrom an infected mother to her\nnewborn baby.\n\"Poor sterilisation of surgical\nequipment contributes to its\nspread as in traditional circumcision\nceremonies,\" a Kemri expert\nsays. In Nakuru District,\nmedical staff, laboratory staff,\nthe armed forces and policemen\nwho handle accident victims are\nat high risk, and have therefore\nbeen immunised against the\ndisease.\nDespite being dangerous to all\nage groups, Hepatitis B is most\ninfectious among children in\ntheir first years of life. They often\nbecome carriers of the virus.\nAs many as one million Kenyan\nchildren aged' under 15 years\ncarry the virus, 50,000 of whom\nare expected to eventually develop\nacute Hepatitis B complications\nand die of liver cirrhosis or\nliver cancer in adulthood.\nWorldwide, hepatitis B is estimated\nby the World Health Organisation\n(WHO) to affect approximately 50 million new\npeople every year. Two million\nof them are killed by the disease.\nLike many other viral diseases,\nHepatitis B has no known cure.\nThe virus, which lodges in the\nliver, can stay in the body for\nmany years without causing any\ndiscomfort and without the carriers\nrealising that they were infected.\nThe Nakuru District Public\nHealth Officer (DPHO), Mr\nEliud Imbayi, says the best way\nto control Hepatitis B was\nthrough vaccination.\nCases of the deadly diseases\nexist in Nakuru District, \"although\nI believe many cases pass\nunnoticed. Different diseases\nhave a habit of showing the same\nsymptoms,\" he adds.\nHowever, Mr Alex Mutai, a\nlaboratory technician at the Nakuru\nGeneral Hospital involved\nin blood examination for this virus\nsays that Hepatitis B cases\nwere not many. \"They could be\none in a thousand. With immunisation,\nbetter hygiene and public\nawareness, they are bound to\ndrop.\" .\nHepatitis B vaccine has been\navailable since the early 1980s.\nHowever, it was expensive and\nbeyond the pockets of many\nwananchi until 1991 when the\nprices went down.\nVaccines were first introduced\nin Kenya in 1991 and that same\nyear, the Government started administering\nthem in poliomyelitis\nand measles,\" says Samuel Kipkor,\nthe clinical officer in charge\nof Kabarak Health Centre.\nKenya has stepped the war\nagainst this killer by introducing\na highly effective but low cost\nvaccine named \"Hepaccine B\" .\nThe new vaccine costs about half\nthe price of previous varieties\nand provides effective protection\nagainst the disease for a period of\nfive years.\nThe vaccine is being administered\nat a cost of Sh441 a dose\nfor adults and Sh221 for children.\nEach dose is administered in\nthree courses at an interval of one\nmonth. It is manufactured by a\nleading South Korean Pharmaceutical\nCompany, Cheil Foods\nand Chemicals, and is being marketed\nin Kenya by Sal Healthcare\nLimited.\n\nSale of blood banned\nBEIJING, Wednesday\nBlood donated by an 18-year-old\ncarrier of HIV spread the virus to\n132 other people, leading health\nauthorities to urge stricter control\nof the blood supply, official reports\nsaid recently.\nAlarmed by the rapid spread of\nAids, China banned the sale of\nblood beginning this year. Blood collection\ncentres are supposed to\nrely solely on voluntary donations.\nThe discovery that 132\npeople recently had been infected\nby a single person who had donated\nblood many times in northern\nShanxi Province has raised\nthe alarm, prompting the Health\nMinistry to urge local officials to\ntake more precautions. (AP)\n\nWhy girls fail to realise their full potential\nOne of the reasons why girls' education lags behind that, of boys is that during upbringing in childhood, the girl is culturally programmed\nfor the function of bearing and rearing children. This 'is why in the majority\nof cases, she is not able to realise her other potentials through\neducation and training.\nThis is because she programmed to regard the man as a tower of\nstrength for whom she will bear and rear children as expected of her\nby tradition.\nAids makes it essential for the woman to make decisions regarding\nher productive health.\nAs a result of traditional prejudices against women, many of them\nhave difficulties in dealing with the rigid requirements of education,\ncareers and other modem requirements. These requirements make it\ndifficult for many women to continue playing their multiple roles as\nmothers while contributing fully to other social and economic activities.\n*** Our aids against Aids are in making it mandatory for more\ngirls to complete primary and secondary education and undertake\ntraining thereafter.\nAfter getting married and as the marriage develops, the women them themselves\nmature and develop their potential within marriage. The experience\nof child bearing and rearing is a major source of obvious natural\nstrength for her.\nShe also learns from other women and from working colleagues.\nBecause of their closer relation to the children, they naturally appear to have become the more powerful personalities.\nThere is fear held by some men that nature has given women so much power in the bearing and rearing of children. Furthermore, this natural power of women has led men to the erroneous belief that the\nprimary role of women is the bearing and rearing of children and that\nthe house is therefore the only rightful place for a woman Today however, women are able to perform the multiple roles of\nbearing and rearing children as well as professionals jobs. They have\nfully disapproved these prejudices.\nThis growth of the wife reduces what was assumed to be her weak\nnature in relation to her husband, thereby appearing to minimise the\nculturally assumed strength and authority of the man.\nShe is no longer the meek, submissive and ignorant bride. She is an\nexperienced mother who is now the authority in the needs of children\nthat must be met.\nIt s this development of the wife that many husbands find difficult\nor impossible to adapt to. Where the husband had not been prepared,\nbefore marriage, about this kind of natural change of the wife, the inevitable\noutcome is an angry male spouse. He reacts emotionally by\nbecoming more and more angry and by blaming his wife for every\nproblem. This is how a great deal of wife beating arises. This will in\nturn lead to strain and...conflict in the marriage which may eventually\nbreak up.\n\nOur aids against Aids are in ensuring men are adequately\nprepared regarding what to expect in marriage with the birth\nof children."}
