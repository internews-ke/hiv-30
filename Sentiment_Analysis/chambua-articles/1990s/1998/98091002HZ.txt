{"text": "Song and dance to combat killer\nBV EVANS OMBIRO\nThey sing, dance, act and deliver poems, verses and\nnarratives packed with\nstrong messages directed at\nsociety and their peers. As\nthey sweat and drain their energies,\nthey hope to win at least two prizes\n- the war against a killer disease,\nand the trophies awarded at the\ncompetition.\nThese are Kenyan youth, who\nhave in the last four years been\nchanneling their creativity into\nhelping stave off the HIV/Aids\npandemic's unrelenting spread.\nThrough a national drama festival,\nyoung Kenyans have been employing\ndramatic expressions to\ndisseminate messages about this\nscourge to which they are more\nvulnerable than other age groups.\nAccording to Mr Gathecha Kamau\nof Artnet Waves Communications,\nthrough the festival which\nwent national last year, \"youth are\nable to articulate in a creative way\ntheir knowledge about HIV/Aids\nand to suggest ways of controlling\nand preventing its spread. \"\nThe standing ovation and the applause\nthe groups get after a thrilling\nperformance symbolize  new consisgains\nmade in the war against HIV /Aids.\nHowever, the organisers and the communicators\nare yet to fully address the issue of outreach.\nWhereas attempts have been made to take\nwinning plays to rural communities, much more\nneeds to be done, so that the messages reach as\nmany people as possible.\nGiven its entertaining nature, theatre is potentially\nan effective mediun1 for sharing out crucial\ninformation on HIV/Aids.\nThe National Youth Wodd Aids Day Drama\nFestival kicks off in Meru this Saturday at the\nregional level. Other regions will be holding festivals\nlater this month, in preparation for the nationals\nin November.\nYouth groups will present plays, poems, oral\nnarratives, verses and open items stressing\nbehaviour change, modes of HIV/ Aids prevention\nand care for the infected and the affected\npersons.\nThe festival is aimed at giving people aged\nbetween 10-35 years an opportunity to articulate\ntheir knowledge of the Human Immunodeficiency\nVirus.\nThe initiation of the festival in 1994 was\nbased upon the realisation of the increasing vulnerability\nof young Kenyans aged 15-39 to HIV\ninfection. Over 70 per cent of the estimated 1.3,\nmillion Kenyans infected with HIV fall within\nthis age bracket.\nDeaths due to Aids are increasing because of\nthe existence of a large pool of people infected\nwith HIV. Sexual contact accounts for up to 90\nper cent of Aids cases in Kenya.\nThe first festival was organised by the Nairobi Aids Task Force, with the support of\nUSAlD, through Family Health International/\nAIDSCAP, featuring 30 youth groups from\nNairobi.\nThe following year's festival attracted 60\ngroups, again from Nairobi. In 1996, more\ngroups participated, corning from as far as\nCoast, Nyanza and Eastern provinces.\nMr Edwin Saka, the chief adjudicator at the\n1997 finals said winning groups presented' 'mature\nperformances. The choral verses were powerful\nand well-interpreted, touching on the\ntheme,\" he observed.\nSo impressive was the winning verse by Kizingo\nArts Troupe from Coast Province, that adjudicators\nsuggested it be turned into an advert.\nThe verse titled The Untouchable depicted how\nthe virus that causes Aids is transmitted.\nThe top five plays were competitive., just like the\nverses, representing two categories whose pieces\nwere thematic and of high artistic quality. Choral\nverses were the most outstanding pres(nominations in\nthe finals.\nMombasa was well-represented, and that was\nwhy they took many trophies. Coast emerged the\nbest region followed by Central/Mount Kenya.\nA report on the festival by the orgalltisers, Artnet\nWaves Communication notes that the HIV infection\nrate is going down in some countries, for instance\nUganda as a result of consistent and continued mv/\nAids prevention efforts.\nUSAID Kenya director Dr George Jones said the effort is worthwhile although the country had not\nachieved as much success as Uganda.\nThe festival has been hailed as an \"effective folk\nmedium to communicate messages. \"\nThe project began with the mobilisation of youth\ngroups in fiv,eregions: Coast, Nairobi, Central\nMount Kenya, Western/Nyanza and Rift Valley.\nOne of the major roles of the regional workshops\nwas to underline the importance of the youth as\nagents of the behavour change process among their\npeers and community at large. The young people\nare communicators of behaviour change.\nThe festival aims at facilitating open discussions\nabout sex and gender and roles using theatre, thereby\nbreakig the cultural practices that promote the\nspread ofmV/Aids. Also targeted is the transmission\nof messages discouraging the stigmatisation of\npeople with Aids and promote care for the infected\nand 'affected persons.\nMr Kamau, the director of Artnet, says the festival\nhelps sustain HIV/Aids awareness among the\nyouth, with emphasis on adoption of safer sexual\nbehaviour to control and prevent the spread of the\nscourge and other sexually transmitted infections.\nWhile scripting, rehearsing and presenting items\nfor the competition, youth are constantly reminded\nof the messages they want to convey to their audiences.\nThus, they too cannot escape the reality of\ntheir creations and are, hopefully, influenced in the\ncourse of doing this.\nThe organisers have learnt that most of the participants\nare unemployed youths who would also\nlika to use drama to eam some money. The challenge\nof guiding the young people and giving them\nincentives to continue spreading the gospel through\ndrama cannot be escaped. Theirs is a cry for assistance\nto utilise their skills to benefit society, and\nthemselves.\nPCEAEastleigh's lohn Mwangi, Brian Kasivi and Moses Njoroge in Tangled Web, the group's entry for this year's festival.\nPCEAEastleigl1were the winners of last year's festival.\nCouples advised on proper use of contraceptives\nThe occurrence of an unplanned\nand unwanted pregnancy is a\nmajor additional problem to a\nfamily which is affected by\nAids. Even under normal circumstances,\nit is necessary for\nthe couple to know early the\nnumber of children they desire\nto have. This is of particular importance\nto the woman.\nSpacing children means delaying\nconception. But this may\nnot be a major concern, especially\nwhere the couple believe\nthey should have as many children\nas possible.\nIn spacing of children the\npregnancies are merely delayed.\nBut even then there is always\nsome desire for it to occur sooner\nthan later. This means that the\ncouple have to be adequately\nmotivated to delay the pregnancy.\nPrevention or delay of a pregnancy\nis an important decision\nfor any couple and requires that\nthe couple have full and consistent knowledge on all of its\naspects.\nOur aids against Aids lie in\nenabling marrying couples\nto plan their families carefully.\n. The failure by many couples\nto prevent an unplanned pregnancy\nis often due to lack of motivation\nto use any of the known\nmethods of doing so. Furthermore,\nthe main factor that determines\nthat motivation appears to\nbe the level of knowledge and\neducation which the young persons\nwill have received from\nany early age regarding sexuality\nand family development.\nLack of knowledge on sexuality\nand motivation by many\npeople regarding prevention of\npregnancy continues to be a major\nhandicap. This means therefore\nthat the acquisition of ethically\nguided skills and\nknowledge on sexuality is an essential\nrequirement for the successful use of methods of preventing\npregnancy acceptable to\nmodern society.\nKnowledge on sexuality is a\nmost effective possession as a\nway of preventing unwanted and\npoorly supported children because\nit regulates other aspects\nof sexual behaviour.\nThe possession of knowledge\nenhances the motivation and\nability of the couple. Aids\nmakes this a necessity.\nIn order to be able to prevent\npregnancy, the spouses must be\nable to describe the menstrual\nperiods of the woman, the process of ejaculation by the man\nand their general as well as sexual relations.\nThe spouses who have this\nability are able to control sex\nand they understand the question\nof the woman becoming pregnant\nand the man making her\npregnant.\nThis is particularly important\nin the case of women because\nthey do become pregnant even\nwhen they are grossly ignorant\nabout sexuality.\nOur aids against Aids lie in\neducating adolescent girls fully on the menstrual cycle.\nAbility also means tl1e specific\nknowledge and skills regarding\nvarious methods of preventing\nconception. This kind of routine\nrequires an organised mind and\nability to maintain a record of\nevents in the menstrual cycle.\nIn the case of avoidance of\npregnancy by the natural method,\nit requires that the couple\nhave accurate knowledge and record\nof the woman's menstrual\ncycle.\nThis is because the couple depend\non having sex during the\nlast week of the menstrual cycle\npopularly known as the safe period.\nThe couple must also know\nwhat to do when the periods become\nirregular for such reasons\nas anxiety, fatigue or illness.\nPrevention of conception by\nwithdrawal requires the man to\nknow the exact moment at\nwhich he has to withdraw without\nleaving any semen in the vagina\nthat may cause pregnancy. The use of condoms also requires\nan ability for acquiring\nand keeping them and then remembering\nto put them on before\nstarting sex and according\nto instructions.\nIn general, condoms are so\npoorly used that their effectiveness\nis often not realised. Furthermore,\ncondoms cannot be\nused to replace the social values\nand ethics that should have bee\ngiven to the young persons.\nIn the case of the women, the\nproper use of oral contraceptives\nfirstly entails keeping the container\nin a proper place. Then\nwhen she needs a pill she has to\nreach the container, get a pill out\nof it regularly, swallow it and\nthen return tl1e container. \n\nOur aids against Aids lie in\nensuring that young persons\nreceive value- added and ethically-\nguided education on\nadolescent development and\ncourtship."}
