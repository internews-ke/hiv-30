{"text": "Enhance effort to\ncheck Aids\u00b7 threat\nThe latest statistics on the extent of the Aids scourge in Kenya\npaint a frighteningly gloomy scenario. But they also dramatise\nthe urgency that must be injected into the campaign to roll\nback the threat from a disease that poses a serious socio economic\nchallenge.\nThe National Aids/STDs Control Programme in the Ministry\nof Health indicates that some 256,750 Kenyans have died\nof Aids since the first case was discovered in the early 1980s.\nIf nothing else, the figures are a firm confirmation that the disease\nis indeed a serious scourge. Besides those who have perished\nwithin this period, the programme says another 1.5 million\nKenyans are infected. Needless to say, there is no cure.\nTherefore, those who develop full blown Aids will add to the\nfast growing numbers of the dead.\nAids has been shown to be prevalent among the most productive sector of the economy. When those aged between 20 and 50 years perish in such large numbers, it means that the\neconomy is being robbed of manpower it really needs. In fact,\na recent seminar held in Nairobi on Aids in the workplace amply\ndemonstrated that employers are concerned about the potential\nadverse consequences on their workforce.\nStatistics unveiled at another recent seminar on Aids held\nat Limuru indicate that in the year 2000, 50 per cent of bed occupancy\nin public hospitals will be taken up by Aids patients.\nIt is also feared that by the year 2005 the disease will have\nclaimed 3 million lives .\n\u2022Since the most common mode of Aids transmission in\nKenya is through sexual intercourse, the campaign to raise\nawareness about the need to avoid risky sexual behaviour\nmust be stepped up.\nThe enormity of the Aids menace is evident. Current religious\narguments over whether or not people should be supplied\ncondoms will not change the reality. What is required is\na means to boost awareness and strengthen the crusade for\nprevention.\nThe Second National Aids Conference, which opens at\nMbagathi, Nairobi, today and the Kenya Aids NGOs consortium\nseminar on Women and HIV, starting on Friday, are important\nforums to address this serious problem.\nTheir proceedings should be keenly followed and supported\nin the war against Aids."}
