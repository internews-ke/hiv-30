{"text": "Aids vaccine trial allowed\nNEW YORK. Wednesday\nThe Food and Drug Administration has granted permission to VaxGen Inc. for the United States first large-scale trial for an Aids prevention vaccine, the Wall Street Journal has reported.\nHeaded by virologist Donald Francis, who successfully battled the Ebola virus in the Sudan and smallpox in India, the three-year trial of Aidsvax will include 5,000 volunteers in the US and 2,500 in Thailand. Tests in the United States are expected to begin this month, the Journal said, and in Thailand by the end of the year.\nAn ideal Aids vaccine would train the human immune system to ward off infection by creating antibodies, though critics say a vaccine alone is unlikely to provide immunity against HIV.\nSome 30 million people worldwide have Aids.\nThere are other Aids vaccines in early trials. But Seth Berkley, president of the nonprofit lnternational Aids Vaccine Initiative, said the Aidsvax trial was a 'watershed in the Aids crisis.'\nFDA permission does not mean the government endorses Aidsvax, but merely that trials would conform to a certain standard of safety and that prior testing showed, indications of biological activity.\nMeasurable antibodies were present in more than 90 per cent of those who received Aidsvax during earlier trials, the journal said. (AP)\n\nStandardised bride price urgedt\nThere is need standardise dowry\nto enable young people to marry.\nThe issue of bride price sometimes\nleads to strained relations\nbetween the in-laws and newly\nmarried couples. Traditionally,\nthe payment of dowry was\nstretched over a long period of\ntime to allow the families on both\nsides to get to know each other\nand establish real kinships. The\nprocess also involved standardised stages at\nwhich standardised items were exchanged\nand extensive discussions held between the\ncouple's families.\nA similar standardisation is necessary today\nto give a couple time to establish themselves\nin marriage.\nA standardised system for the couples to\nprovide help to their respective parents also\nneeds to be worked out to strengthen the kinships\nthat will have been established.\n*** Our aids against Aids are in ensuring\nthat the requirements for exchange of\nmaterial items did not ruin the marriage itself. In traditional African communities, the preparation and process of marriage involves the\npayment of dowry to the girl's parents. In\nsuch communities, children born to a woman\nfor whom dowry has been paid are considered\nto be the legal offspring of her husband.\nHowever, even though the important aspect\nof this custom is the human relationship that\nit establishes between the families, it has become\nan increasingly difficult obligation for\nmany bridegrooms to meet. This is particularly\nthe case today where the girl's family look upon dowry as a means of acquiring wealth.\nIn other communities, the resources are\npassed from the girl's parents to her new home at the time of marriage. In such communities, dowry consists of presents which are traditionally\ngiven to a bride by her\nparents.\nIn such a society, it is a matter\nof cultural pride to be able to\nadorn the bride expensively at\nthe time of marriage.\nIn a home with several daughters, this can be a real liability because the bridegrooms in such communities can make heavy demands on their parents-inlaw.\nIn such communities it is not uncommon\nfor baby girls to be married to baby boys to\navoid the grooms making dowry demands\nthat such families cannot afford.\nIn such communities, baby girls are killed\nduring pregnancy and immediately after birth\nbecause of the dowry problem.\nThis is why dowry should be standardised\nas had been the case traditionally.\nOur aids against Aids are in removing\nthose dowry practices which lead to the destination of marriage itself."}
