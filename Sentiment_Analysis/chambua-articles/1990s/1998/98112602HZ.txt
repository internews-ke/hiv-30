{"text": "Danger looms as\npeople make merry\nBy JOSEPH G1CHURU\nIn the tea growing zones of Meru Central District, two events\ncoincide with Christmas: the second tea payment (popularly\nknown as bonus) and boys' circumcision.\nThe bonus triggers a period of free-spending, excessive\ndrinking and permissive sexual activities.\nAt the same time, the conclusion of Kenya Certificate of\nPrimary Education examinations ushers a period of celebration\nas the villagers burst into a month-long carnival-like boys'\ncircumcision rituals.\nBoys, mainly Standard Eight leavers are initiated into manhood.\nThe practice is deep-rooted in Central and South Imenti\nconstituencies.\nThe traditional circumcision ritual is so highly valued that\nparents, who would otherwise have their sons circumcised in\nhospitals, are intimidated through wanton destruction of their\nproperty and ridiculing of their sons into accepting that their\nsons be circumcised in \"the right way\".\nHowewr, in this day and age of HIV/Aids, the twin events\n- bonus and traditional circumcision rites - may spell doom\nto the residents if immediate measures are not taken to change\ntheir lifestyles. The sharing of the circumciser's knife among initiates exposes the newly circumcised boys to the risk of contracting\nHIV.\nAids prevalence in the district is alarmingly high, having\nbeen accelerated by sexual promiscuity among the youth and\nadults:\nA survey released recently by the local Medical Officer of\nHealth, Dr John Ogange, shows that up to 80 per cent of deaths\namong the: 15-49 age-group are Aids-related.\nAccording to the survey, the age at which youths first engaged\nin sexual activity is going down. In Meru, boys engage\nin sexual activities at 13 while girls have sex at II years.\nThe sexual habits in the district have not been helped by the\nrampant drug abuse ~ Meru men are notorious for alcohol,\nmiraa abuse and, lately, bhang smoking. Other causes of promiscuity\namong young people in the district, the report says,\nare pornographic literature and lack of parental guidance.\nThe shocking Aids situation in Meru comes to light barely\nfive years. after the district was identified as an area with low\nHIV prevalence.\nUntil three years ago, the virus prevalence among mothers\nattending antenatal clinics was only nine. per cent, noted a\n1996 National Aids and STDs Control Programme report titled\nAids in Kenya: Background, projections, impact\nand intervention. Then, the situation in Meru District was\ncontrasted with that of Kisumu where the disease prevalence\namong the same group reached 30 per cent\nA chat with a group of unemployed young men aged between\n20 and 28 years - secondary school-Ieavers .and university\ngraduates, shows peer pressure still determines the\nyouths' sexual behaviour, partly due to indoctrination during\nthe circumcision seclusion period.\nSitting in a hotel at Kathera market where youths gather for\na cup of tea in the evenings after a long day's work, 10 male\nyouths discussed all manner of issues ranging from local politics\nand the bonus to the forthcoming circumcision rites.\nRobert (not his real name), 20, introduced the Aids subject\ninto the discussion when he inquired about the situation in hospitals.\nThe other young men stopped to listen keenly as this writer\nexplained the congestion in major public health institutions resulting\nfrom HIV-related infections. Then I asked them: Does\nany of you know someone who is suffering from or has died of\nAids?\nJesse; the oldest in the group, said he knew II men whose\nformer girlfriends were currently sick. Other young men nodded\nin affirmation. Although they all agreed that it was important\nto know one's HIV status, they feared the results might not be kept confidential.\nIn response to a question on how they would conduct themselves\nsexually on testing HIV negative, their answers ranged\nfrom sensible to ridiculous.\nSaid Jesse: \"I lust for nine girls in this area. I would only\nconsider having a single partner after conquering the other\neight. \"\nRobert added: \"I can't control myself. I am used to having\nsex frequently, and I don't like using condoms. Using a condom\nis like sucking a wrapped sweet.\"\nJerry, an unemployed graduate, said: \"I would henceforth\nopt for protected sex using condoms. I know it is not as pleasurable\nas the real thing but I have to take precautions.\"\nKen, who said he does not engage in sex, said: \"I would abstain\nfrom premarital sex completely. After marriage, my suitor\nand I would then undergo a HIV test before consummating\nour love.\"\nWhen told that the most effective prevention of Aids and\nother STDs is abstinence from sex, the youths laughed it off,\ndismissing Ken's answer as \"academic and impracticable\".\nThe other youths reserved their comments, but indicated\nthey would do something to change their sexual behaviour.\nHowever, the look on their faces betrayed the young men's\nunderlying worries and fears concerning their health in the\nface of sexually transmitted diseases, including Aids, after realising\nhow vulnerable they are to HIV infection.\nThose who had reserved their comments later said they\nfeared looking stupid in front of their peers, a pointer to the\ndeep-rooted peer pressure in regard to youth sexuality.\nMisconceptions about the disease also emerged from the\ndiscussion on Aids.\nJesse, the most vocal in the group, said he knew he had no\nAids because when he gets a cut on his body, it heals quickly.\n\"I know people with Aids do not heal from whatever infections\nthey get,\" he said, convinced that he was all right.\nHowever, the young men were in agreement that Aids or\nany other STD could no longer be regarded as an urban disease\nas was the case a few years ago.\nRobert said he had previously been infected with a STD after\nhaving sex with a primary school girl who he thought was\nfree from infection.\nIn this area, the HIV transmission increases because initiates\nshare the same circumciser's knife.\nAccording to Dr James Machoki, a University of Nairobi reproductive\nhealth expert, traditional circumcision, both for\nboys and girls, is an important factor in HIV transmission\namong the communities where it is practised.\nHowever, he adds, circumcision's role in Aids transmission\nhas not been documented.\nWhat is not in doubt, though, is that should any of the initiates\nbe infected, then whole villages' population face decimation\nby Aids.\n\"The World Bank country director, Mr Harold Wackman,\ntold the Second National HIV/Aids and STDs Conference at\nMbagathi that HIV/Aids accounts for more than 41 percent of\ndeaths in the rural areas. The conference was also told that\nmore than 1.5\u00b7million Kenyans are infected with the virus and\nover 250,000 others have already died from the disease.\nIn spite of the reality of Aids in rural Kenya, few people are\nwilling to admit that avoiding high risk behaviour is the way\nout.\nIf nothing is done in Meru Central, control the high-risk cultural\nrites and sexual behaviour, the results of what is being\ndone in the name of \"eating tea bonus\" and elaborate circumcision\nrites may spell doom for the residents.\nTime to become a man: A boy awaits the circumciser's knife to graduate into manhood.\nMedical experts warn against the sharing of a single knife among the initiates."}
