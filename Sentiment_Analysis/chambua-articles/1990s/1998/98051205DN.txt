{"text": "HIV explosion explained \nParing on beach to blame - report\nBy CHURCHIU OTIENO \nThe practice of \"allocating\" women to male partners along fish-landing beaches in Lake Vic toria has been singled out as a major factor in the spread of HIV/Aids in Nyanza Province.\nA joint report by the Ministry of Health and a British non-governmental organisation says the practice, which is enforced to avoid fighting over women, contributed considerably to the transmission of the virus.\nThe report, dated April 16, 1998, is by the Ministry of Health through its National Aids and STD Control Programme and the UK's Futures Group International. The two bodies are involved in implementing an HIV/Aids prevention and care project funded by the British Fund for International Development.\nThe project draws its facts from workshops held with fishing community leaders from fish-landing beaches in Migori, Suba, Homa Bay, and Rachuonyo districts.\n It says: \"There is a regulation ensures that women who come to the beach are allocated male partners .... This is done all women who come to the beach including widows who lost partners to HIV/Aids. No one is sure of the HIV statues of the male partner to whom they are assigned.\nThe project's NGO/training coordinator, Mr Richard Odindo, said the three-year programme was initially started in Nyanza Province but would spread to the other parts of the country.\nMr Odindo' announced that a programme to finance community-based organisations on Aids prevention would be launched.\nOther factors that promote the spread of the killer disease among the fishing communities were:\nWomen having to have contact persons in different fishing boats as a strategy to ensure procurement of adequate fish, an arrangement usually maintained by sexual favours.\nThe mobility of fishermen - and women.\nThe use of the same blade for to several people by traditional for healers.\nAbuse of drugs and alcohol and thriving prostitution.\nSome men at the beaches are available to hire to perform rituals associated with wife inheritance for widows.\nPrevalent poverty.\nInaccessibility of sexually transmitted diseases' treatment and information.
