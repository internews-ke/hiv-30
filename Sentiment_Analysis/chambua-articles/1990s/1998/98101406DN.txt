{"text": "Aids -menace must be seriously fought\nIt may have been done with the flair of the Nelson Mandela style of managing state affairs, but the symbolism of it all should not overshadow the critical Aids message the exercise was meant to send out, not only to South Africans but also to the whole continent.\nLast Friday, President Mandela ordered the South African flag flown at half-staff on all government buildings and foreign missions in memory of his compatriots who have died of Aids: All businesses with South African flags were similarly urged to do the same.\nThis gesture preceded by a day the launch of the South African government's new strategy against the growing incidence of Aids. The campaign launched by Deputy President Thabo Mbeki included a special 10-minute address broadcast live on TV and radio. Cautioning South Africans to change the way they live and love, Mr Mbeki said his country had for too many years allowed the virus to spread at one of the fastest rates in the world.\n\"Every single day 1,500 people in South Africa get infected,\"\nMr Mbeki told his compatriots. \"To date, more than three million people have been infected.\"\nWith a few exceptions, many African governments have been terribly slow in acknowledging that, unlike other ailments, Aids can no longer be seen as a health problem affecting individual citizens, but rather as a problem of national concern. In some countries, .the political leadership is known to make fleeting references to Aids, but few have shown the political will to declare war on the explosion of HIV. Many governments have left the battle to non-governmental organisations and international agencies where these ought to be playing supporting roles.\nIn analysing the economic debacle facing one southern Africa state recently, an international media organisation said\n\"many homes have lost a breadwinner either due to death from Aids or lay-off in corporate failures in industry commerce, mining and agriculture\".\nThis is a picture that could be reproduced in several other countries, including Kenya, in varying degrees. It is a worrying picture that tells all governments to do more than pay lip service to the Aids menace."}
