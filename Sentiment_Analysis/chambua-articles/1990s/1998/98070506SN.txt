{"text": "Preventing Aids only way forward\nAn important gathering, the. 12th World Aids Conference, has been taking place in Geneva, Switzerland. Important because it is on a subject close to the hearts and minds of all sane individuals, for it concerns a scourge that is anything trough\npopulations, slowing down economies, upsetting families and communities, and may well wipe out the human race.\nAids is a frightening phenomenon. And not just because it\nhas no cure but also because it bas brought out the worst in man. Its origin has been the subject of painful controversy,\nwith accusations and counter accusations of a most racist and\ninhuman nature being traded back and forth, with the method\nof science as we know it being thrown overboard so that fear\nand loathing have now become the premises of what is purported\nto be scientific truth ... ' .\nThis is why the Aids conference is welcome, for it is a vindication\nof humanity, evidence that humanity can, If It has the\nwill, cast its differences aside and bring the strengths of its diversity to bear on a common enemy ...\nAnd though it is premature to turn out the band, there is. a\nBody or researchers who belive the battle in the laboratory is beginning to turn, that HIV,. the Virus sent to try humanity,\nmay not be retreating, but at least its merciless advance of appears to have been checked.\nScientists are talking of breakthroughs and advances, of\nprotease inhibitors and cocktails of drugs that have helped\n100,000 patients in Europe and America. They talk of a reduction in HIV -related complications and a 50 per cent drop in Aids mortality in America. To that extent, there IS reason for very cautious optimism ..\nThe war that is being lost though, is the one played In the\npockets of men. There are 30 million people infected with\nHIV, 90 per cent of whom live in the so-called Third World where these super-expensive drugs are cruelly beyond their reach. Few can afford even AZT, one of the oldest Aids drugs and perhaps the least expensive.\nThe decision by Glaxo Wellcome to reduce the price of\nAZT in poor countries is laudable. But this is an isolated case that is unlikely to be widely emulated, which is why poor countries must invest every effort in preventing infection rather than longing for complicated drugs they cannot afford."}
