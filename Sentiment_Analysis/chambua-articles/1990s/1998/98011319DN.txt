{"text": "Proponents say 'move will prevent over three million children's deaths\nGroup in push for vaccines\nWASHINGTON, Monday\nBackers of an eight-year-old drive\n6 immunise all children against\ndeadly diseases are seeking a new\nworldwide push to develop new'\nvaccines that could save millions\nof lives each year.\nThe plan of Children's Vaccine\nInitiative, supported by three UN\nagencies, the World Bank and the\nNew York-based Rockefeller\nFoundation, is for the wider use of\nexisting vaccines against several\nchildhood diseases that could prevent\nup to three million deaths\neach year.\nAnother eight million children\nand adults also could be saved\neach year by vaccines which are\ncurrently under development and\nmay be available as early as the\nyear 2005. They include vaccines\nagainst pneumococcal pneumonia,\nwhich kills about 1.2 million\nchildren a year; rotavirus and\nother diarrhoeal diseases (2.6 million\ndeaths a year), acute respiratory\nvirus infections (600,000),\nand HIV/Aids (2.3 million).\nNew vaccines could also be a\npowerful weapon against the worrying\nreemergence of deadly diseases\nsuch as tuberculosis, which\nhave developed resistance to antibiotics.\nVaccinations prevent children\nfrom contracting the disease.\nThe plan, \"Managing Opportunity\nand Change: A Vision of\nVaccination for the 21 st Century,\" is backed by the World\nHealth' Organisation, the UN\nChildren's Fund (Unicef), the UN\nDevelopment Programme, the\nWorld Bank, and the Rockefeller\nFoundation.\nCVI was launched at the Children's\nSummit in New York in\n1990. That was the same year that\u00b7\ngovernments, non-governmental\norganisations (NGOs) and global\nagencies reached an initial goal of\nimmunising 80 per cent of the\nworld's children against six deadly\ndiseases: Polio, diphtheria, tetanus,\npertussis, measles, and tuberculosis.\nThe effort saves between\ntwo and three million lives a year.\nSince then, however, no new\nvaccines have been introduced\n. widely, and the percentage of\nchildren who are vaccinated has\nnot increased significantly.\nAccording to the CVI plan, the\nglobal health community should\ntake the vaccination drive to a new\nlevel, by spending more money to\nensure wider coverage and the development\nof new vaccines and\nworking more closely with the\nvaccine companies.\n\"Two things in particular need\nto happen,\" says Mr John La-Montagne, who chairs the CVI\nTask Force on Strategic Planning.\n\"More governments must take\nfull responsibility for expanding\ntheir own immunisation programmes,\nand we must work in\nbroad collaboration with vaccine companies, which has never taken\nplace before.\" .\nThere is no question that a new\nvaccination effort would be very\ncost-effective, particularly for\ngovernments which often bear\nmost of the burden for costs incurred\nby diseases.\nGlobal health expenditures\namount to some two trillion dollars\neach year, according to the report,\nbut only $10 billion is spent\non vaccinations. and only a tenth\nof that is earmarked for research\nand development of new vaccines.\nTo implement the strategy, it says,\n\"substantial new resources beyond\npresent expenditures\" will\nbe required.\nThe new plan sets targets for\nthe development and introduction\n, of vaccines and calls for investments\nin their large-scale produc tion and use. It also recommends a\n\"banding strategy\" by which developing\ncountries will be\ngrouped together according to\ntheir need for external funding\nand support to implement the\nprogramme. That should help vaccine\nmanufacturers adopt pricing\nstrategies to ensure adequate supplies\nto the poorest nations, the report\nsays.\nAmong the specific targets of\nthe plan is the total eradication of\npolio throughout the world by the\nyear 2000. The disease, no new\ncase of which has been reported in\nthe Americas since 1991, still affects \nas many as 50,000 children a\nyear, most of them in South Asia and parts of Africa.\nWHO estimates that countries\nthere will need about one billion\ndollars in external funding, and\nUS$2.7 billion all together to\nwipe out the disease.\nThe plan says US$250 million\nwill be needed for vaccinating 90\nper cent of children worldwide\nagainst measles, which kills some\n1.1 million children a year, about\nhalf of whom are' in sub-Saharan\nAfrica. To eradicate the disease\naltogether will cost about US$4.5\nbillion, according to the plan.\nHepatitis B, which kills about\n800,000 adults. per year (but\nwhich is contracted in early childhood),\ncould be effectively brought under control in poor sub-Saharan African countries for\nonly US$20 million a year, according\nto the strategy, while\ncombatting Hib disease, which\nkills 400,000 to 700,000 children\nannually, would cost about one\nbillion dollars a year.\nVaccines against yellow fever,\nwhich causes about 30,000 deaths\na year, mostly in sub-Saharan\nAfrica, costs only 15 cents a dose\nand could be provided to everyone\nin affected regions, mostly sub-Saharan Africa, for US$17 million\nand then another US$4.6 million\na year for routine vaccination\nof infants.\nVaccinations currently being developed or improved and likely to be introduced by 2002 or before '\ninclude those against rotavirus diarrhoea,\nwhich causes 400,000 to\n600,000 child deaths a year; pneumococcal\npneumonia, which kills\nsome ,1.2 million children a year;\nmeningococcal meningitis\n(20,000-30,000 people a year, especially\nin tropical Africa);- cholera\n(120,000). The plan says\nbroad distribution in poor countries\nshould be achieved by 2005\n2007. By 2010, widespread introduction\nor improvement of vaccines\nagainst viral pneumonia, which\nkills. about 400,000 children a\nyear; bacterial diarrhoeas and typhoid,\nwhich kill two million\npeople a year, mostly children;\nmalaria (1.2 million children' a\nyear); tuberculosis (three million\ndeaths of all ages); and HIVIAids\n(three million new infections of\nmostly young adults) should be\nachieved, according to, the plan.\n(IPS)"}
