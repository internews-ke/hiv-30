{"text": "MONDAY MARCH 30 1998\nImpact of Aids forces\nsex workers, clients\nto be more guarded\n\nBy ROSEMARY OKELLO\u2028\n The reality of Aids is forcing commercial sex workers and their clients to behave more carefully where sex is concerned.\u2028\n A study carried out by Dr Joshua Kimani of the Microbiology\u2028\n Department, University of\u2028\n Nairobi, amongst sex workers in\u2028\n Majengo. Nairobi, notes the steady decline of STDs in Kenya since 1989.\u2028\n Dr Kimani, who is also involved in research on the startling immunity to HIV/Aids among the sex workers in the Majengo slums, says some of the sex workers clients will opt pay more in order not to use a condom although the practise is becoming rare.\u2028\n \u201cThese women are well aware of the dangers of Aids yet they normally give their clients the options to use or not to use the condoms.\u201d\u2028\n In 985, the number 0f commercial sex workers using condoms was less than I percent.\u2028\n Interventions including education condom promotion and\u2028\nSTD treatment has seen this figure increase to 85 percent.\u2028\n This contradicts recent reports from the World Health Organisation (WHO) which puts STI figures worldwide as 333 million new cases every year.\u2028\n According to Dr Kimani, Kenya has been able to achieve reductions in STD infection rates through aggressive promotion of condom use.\u2028\n \u2018Once people use condoms, STD cases automatically decrease because people are not infected\u2019 he says.\u2028\n Asked how it was possible for his study, funded by the Canadian International Development Research Centre, to accord a downward trend while worldwide figures were increasing, he attributed the increase of STDs worldwide to the use of triple therapy which is readily available in the United States of America for the management of STDs.\u2028\n \u201cWhen people know that there is a possibility of o cure to Aids, they become reckless and stop using condoms,\u201d he said.\u2028\n \u2018\u2018The same problem was experienced in Kenya when Kemron was launched and also when there was talk of Pearl Omega.\u201d\u2028\n Though current reports list Sub-Saharah Africa as having the highest incidences of STDs the incidence in Kenya decreased to almost 10 per cent in 1996.\u2028\n \u2018I am sure by last year it was lower than 10 cent,\u201d says\u2028\n Kimani.\u2028\n The research findings conducted at the Microbiology Department \nGonococcal Infection Prevalence indicate that in 1985. The infection rate was about 48\nper cent. This increased in 1987 to 50 per cent. In 1996 it decreased to 10 per cent\n \u2028\n \n Impact of Aids forces sex workers, clients to be more guarded\u2028\n The prevalence of Chlamydia Trichomatosis fell from 14 per cent in 1991 to less than one per cent in 1996.\u2028\n The results are not limited to Nairobi. High usage of condoms countywide has achieved positive results in Busia on the Kenya-Uganda border where the rate of infection in pregnant women testing HIV positive has dropped from 22.0 per cent in 1995 to 7.8 percent in 1996.\u2028\n \u201cThis could be a reflection of what is happening in Uganda where Aids cases are on the decline, says Godfrey Baltazar an\u2028\n Epidemiologist at the Kenya Aids Control Programme. He adds \u201cWe expect the figure to decline further in the 1997 and\u2028\n 1998 period.\u201d\u2028\n In a publication on epidemiology of STD edited by P. L. Penne\u2028\n H. H. Handftetd, K. K. Holmes and Boaunt J. H., the authors note that humanity stands on the threshold of a new era in the\u2028\n management of STDs.\u2028\n \u201cTraditional STDs remain serious public health problem particularly in the developing in the developing\nWorld but they pale in comparison to Aids.\"\nThey also note that there will be a decrease in STDs as the \"baby boom\" generation ages.\n\"We are also witnessing change in sexual behaviour caused in part by the fear of contracting Aids, genital herpes and\nPerhaps other STDs.\n-AWC"}
