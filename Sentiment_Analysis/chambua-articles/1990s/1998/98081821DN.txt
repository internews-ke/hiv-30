{"text": "Campaigns fail to stop Aids\nMedia and Church asked to\nlend more pro-active hell!\nBy Churchill Otieno\nManagers of campaigns against\nthe spread of Aids gave been\nforced to change strategies as\nachieved so far fall short of\nthe desired goal.\nDespite virtually all Kenyans\nknowing that Aids is deadly and\nincurable, many are contracting it\n,daily in a relentless and lethal\nmerry-go-round. The dust in its\nwake are rising death figures.\nHealth authorities in the campaign\nare calling in reinforcements, and already they are beckoning\nto the media and Church to\nplaya bigger role. The mission is\nto sell ideas that would change the\nsociety's risk -prone behaviours.\n-A recent media workshop in\nHoma bay's Hippobuck Hotel\nheard that since the scourge set in,\njournalists had so far done a commendable\njob, pushing awareness\nlevels to beyond 90 per cent of the\npopulation. But it is fast dawning\nthat awareness is not all it takes to\narrest the determined spread of the\nvirus.\nThe new strategy is to go beyond\nalerting the masses of the\ndisease and how its spreads. It\nseeks to help people, especially\nthose, at high risk, to change various\nbehaviours.\nThe Church is being reminded\nthat its congregation comprises\nfamilies, which unfortunately are\nsuffering a serious blow from the\nscourge. The Church therefore\nfaces the choice of letting its faith take the brunt or actively intervene by exhorting moral uprightness\nthrough sermons. The\nChurch is being asked to climb\ndown to reality and not mislead itself\nthat its followers are perfect.\nAvailable statistics depict telling\nfacts. Over 90 per cent of Kenyans\nare aware of the disease and\nhow it spreads but only 46 per\ncent believe they face risks of getting\nit.\nAids flourishes among women\nof 20-25 years and men of 25-35\nyears old. It also targets youth below\n24 years, who account for 70\nper cent of all Aids cases in the\ncountry. Young girls are also\nmore vulnerable. For instance, in\nNyanza Province, an average of\n34 per cent of girls start engaging\nin sex at 14-15 years.\nDuring the media workshop attended\nby 40 journalists, resource\npersons made a case for the media\nto cease \"merely reporting from\nthe periphery\" but to get involved\nin marketing messages that would\nmake readers, listeners and viewers\nchange their risky behaviours.\nAn official of The Futures\nGroup, a UK-based international\nnon-governmental organisation,\nMr Richard Odindo, said the media were now faced with an anti-\nAids challenge in the public interest:\n\"The Fourth Estate must now\nengage in social marketing of its\ncontents to effect behavior\nchange. \"\nMr Odindo. who is the Group's Co-ordinator,\ngave a presentation on \"Social\nMarketing as a Strategy for Initiating\nand Promoting Behaviour\nChange. \"\nHe defines social marketing\nvariously, one being \"the use of\nmarket techniques to generate discussion\nand promote information,\nattitudes, values and behaviours.\nBy doing so, it helps to create a\nclimate conducive to social and\nbehavioural change\" .\n\"Social marketing makes use\nof methods from the commercial\nsector: setting measurable objectives,\ndoing market research, developing\nproducts and services\nthat correspond to genuine needs,\ncreating demand for them through\nadvertising, and finally marketing\nthrough a network of outlets at\nprices that make it possible to\nachieve the sales objectives,\" the\ndictum goes, decidedly pure\ncommerce ..\nMr Odindo said the difference\nbetween commercial and social\nmarketing was in their content and\ngoals but not in the methods they\nuse.\nThe strategy, he said, was not\nutopian since campaigns for social\nchange were not a new.\n\"They have been waged from\ntime immemorial. Social campaigns\nform an integral part of the\nenvironment in industrial and developing\ncountries. They are often\nprompted by the perception that\nsome situation represents a social\nproblem and merits social\naction. \"\nAreas that have recently gained\nfrom this approach, he said, include\nhealth campaigns to reduce\nsmoking, drug abuse, nutrition,\nimmunisation and family planning\namong others.\nHe recommended a more targeted\ncampaign, developed from\nmarket and audience research\nsince social problems are complex\nand interrelated. He argued that\nsolutions needed to be developed\nin light of the specific socio-economic,\nhistorical, religious, and\ncultural frameworks. Often,\npeople who were particularly vulnerable\nor exposed needed to be\nidentified and a campaign developed\ntargeting them.\nMr Odindo is against lumping\npeople together under the assumption\nthat they are \"same\". For instance\nthe youth include male and\nfemale, urban and rural, and have\ndiverse cultural and religious traditions\namong others all which affect\ntheir sexuality.\nHe alluded that due to the prohibitive\ncost of scientific market\nresearch, most community-based\norganisations could not afford it.\nBut they could compensate\nthrough thorough review of available\nmaterials, consult existing\nmarket researches sponsored by\nother organizations. An assessment\nof the situation in the community\nwith the help of \"key informants\"\nsuch as community leaders can be equally helpful.\nBut social campaigns should\nnot be conceived as forums to\neducate or admonish.\nHe warned: \"Some social campaigns\nare designed merely to\nhelp bring problem areas into the\nopen and draw attention to their\nroots, which can often be a taboo\nsubject. Although Sharpening society's\nawareness of a problem is\nnecessary, it is by no means sufficient\nfor bringing about changes\nin societal attitudes and behavior,\nas these are shaped by habits, interests,\nfeelings, and beliefs,\namong other factors. \"\nMr Odindo said the population\nwas even more complicated now\nin so far as Aids was concerned\nsince there are people who have\nadopted behaviour changes. There\nis a second category of the population\nwho were \"receptive but find\nit difficult\" to adopt a given\nbehaviour. A third category were\n\"receptive but think what you are\nsaying is not for them\" and a\nfourth one who are outrightly\nagainst the changes being sold.\nAll the different categories\nmust be targeted individually because\nthey required different social\nmarketing goals. Ultimately,\nthe marketer must find ways to\nmake the adoption of new\nbehaviour easy. Hence, reducing\nsuch costs and creating incentives\nto adopt and maintain the new\nidea or practice over time is a central\ntask of social marketing.\nThe workshop was organised\nunder the HIV Aids Prevention\nand Care (HAPAC) project being\nimplemented jointly by the government\nand the British Department\nfor International Development\n(DFID). The project is being\nmanaged by The Futures Group\nInternational, UK.\nJournalists and health specialists\nat the workshop agreed the\nChurch could not afford to be an\nimpediment in the campaign\nagainst the Aids spread. It was argued\nthat while religion had its\nown guidelines on family life and\nsexuality, very few faithful followed\nthose rules.\nThe Amref deputy country director,\nDr John Nduba, challenged\n, the Church to take a role and stake\nin the campaign against Aids or let\nthe scourge decimate families.\n\"Aids has come up while we\nhave had the Church; we are reacting\nto it while we have the\nChurch. The Church must come to\nget involved. It can't ignore it. In\nKenya, families are suffering terribly.\nFamilies are disappearing\nyet the family is the most sacred\ninstitution. Whole families are\ngetting extinguished, \" he added.\nDr Nduba said the spread of the\nAids virus was enhanced by increased\nopportunities for people\nof different age-groups to have\nsex.\nHe said it was worrying that in\n1996, Nyanza Province accounted\nfor 28 per cent of national Aids cases, a share which had by\nDecember last year increased to\n31 per cent.\nNyanza was leading nationally\nat end of 1997. Other provinces\nwere Rift Valley (17.8%), Eastern\n(12.4%), Central (11.6%), Western\n(10.2%), Nairobi (9.3%),\nCoast (6%) and North Eastern\n(0.7%).\nThe Amref official said that\nwith Aids, kissing was as risky as\nactual intercourse: \"Kissing one\nwhose HIV status you don't know\nis as dangerous as going to bed\nwith that person. Kissing hundreds of people is equal to having\nsex with the same number of\npeople. \"\nParticipants raised concern that\nthe government was contributing\ntowards further mystification of\nthe disease. The Ministry of\nHealth was accused of handling\nAids issues differently from how\nit managed other killer diseases\nsuch as cholera and ebola.\nIt was noted that when people\ndied of cholera or ebola, the\n\"whole government\" went to that\nvillage. \"Why is that not so when\nits Aids?\" asked media practitioner Tervil Okoko.\nThe medical fraternity was\nchallenged that confidentiality\nwith Aids was highly counterproductive.\nThe workshop :was told\nthat under Sessional Paper No. 4\nof 1997, medical doctors had a\nduty to inform the public that one\ndied of Aids, especially those at\nimmediate risk of infection.\nAs health campaigners agonise\nover why almost all Kenyans\nknow there is a danger, but\nstrangely believe the danger is not\nfor them, one is set thinking why\nthis scourge has never become a\nserious political agenda.\n\nAn illustration showing instances of risky behaviour: Despite a high awareness level of Aids, behaviour\nhas not changed among Kenyans."}
