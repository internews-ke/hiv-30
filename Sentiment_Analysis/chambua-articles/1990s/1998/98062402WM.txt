{"text": "WEDNESDAY, JUNE 24, 1998\n\nSex between men\n\nFROM PAGE I\u2028\nthe duties of marriage, on the Kenyan coast young homosexual men\u2028\nlearn from male mkungus.\u2028\nAhmed, 36, who lives in Mombasa, learnt bedroom tactics from a\u2028\nmkungu, as well as how to groom\u2028\nhimself, to look out for disease and\u2028\nto keep his man happy by being a\u2028\ngood cook. The training, which is\u2028\nboth theoretical and practical \u2014\u2028\nincluding sexual \u2014 lasts a month.\u2028\nAt the end of the \u201ccourse\u201d, the\u2028\nyounger man gives the mkungu\u2028\nspecial cloth and kitchen utensils\u2028\nas payment. Ahmed is now a\u2028\nmkungu himself, advising what\u2028\nperfume to sprinkle on one\u2019s body\u2028\nto please the \u201chusband\u201d and demonstrating how to wear the special\u2028\nkhanga (flowered cloth) in the\u2028\nhouse. \u201cYou must be clean and\u2028\nsmell nice to your husband all the\u2028\ntime,\u201d he tells his recruits.\u2028\nFor eight years, Karini, 30, who\u2028\nalso lives in Mombasa, has maintained a relationship with a 40-\u2028\n\u2018ear-old man married to his cousin. Five years ago, the cousin\u2028\ncaught them in bed. To hush things\u2028\nup, Karim was asked to marry his\u2028\nlover\u2019s 16-year-old adopted\u2028\ndaughter. From Karim\u2019s point of\u2028\nview, it was a good arrangement,\u2028\nas it offered him both the respect\u2028\nability of a wife and continued access to his lover, now his father-in-\u2028\nlaw. With no experience with girls,\u2028\nKarim forced himself on his wedding night to provide his relatives\u2028\nwith the evidence that he had bro\u2028\nKen his wife\u2019s virginity He now\u2028\nhas a five-year-old daughter and\u2028\ndoes not want another child.\u2028\nTwo evenings a week he and his\u2028\nlover hire a hotel room, where they\u2028\nspend several hours before each re\u2028\nturns to his wife.\u2028\nAt the travel agency where he\u2028\nworks, Karim\u2019s colleagues know\u2028\nthat he is gay. The women are\u2028\nfriendly, but some men despise\u2028\nhim while others approach him in\u2028\nprivate. Karim believes that most\u2028\nmen in Mombasa enjoy sex with\u2028\nother men and rejects the theory\u2028\nthat homosexuality was brought by\u2028\ntourists.\u2028\nFazal, 30, a mechanical engineer\u2028\nwith an I8-year-old lover, agrees.\u2028\nNow he is faithful to his partner,\u2028\nbut as a teenager he had several experiences with fellow boys.\u2028\n\u201cMany men in Mombasa try out\u2028\nhomosexuality in their youth,\u201d he says.\u2028\nAbdul, also 30, is a successful\u2028\nbusinessman who travels frequently to the Gulf. He was a virgin\u2028\nwhen his parents found a wife for\u2028\nhim, as is the tradition, and they\u2028\nhave a two-year-old daughter.\u2028\nMeanwhile, Abdul has been in a\u2028\nloving relationship with another\u2028\nman his own age for the past three\u2028\nyears. They have a small flat in\u2028\nwhich they meet regularly and\u2028\nwhere Abdul does all the house\u2028\nwork. In his own house, where his\u2028\nwife and sisters prepare and serve\u2028\nhis food, the roles are reversed.\u2028\nRocky, 23, is a tall young man\u2028\nfrom western Kenya who was\u2028\nbrought up in Mombasa. He is a\u2028\nstudent of languages and hopes to\u2028\nbecome a tour guide. When he was\u2028\nyounger, a neighbour his father\u2019s\u2028\nage introduced him to homosexual\u2028\nactivity. Their affair lasted three\u2028\nyears. For the moment, Rocky does\u2028\nnot have a stable relationship.\u2028\n\u201cMarriage is not an option for\u2028\nme,\u201d he says. \u201cGod made me and\u2028\nunderstands me. I don\u2019t think what\u2028\n I do is a sin.\u201d\u2028\nMost men who have sex with\u2028\nmen in Kenya keep their activities\u2028\nso secret they will not admit it to\u2028\nclose friends or family members.\u2028\nAs a result, the pressures of a double life get to many men. On the\u2028\none hand, Abdul appears to adore\u2028\nhis male lover of the last three\u2028\nyears, but at the same time he says\u2028\nthat now he has a one-year son he\u2028\nis tired of \u201cplaying around with\u2028\nthe woman\u201d.\u2028\nHe would like to begin a new life and stop his homosexual relationship. \u201cI don\u2019t want my son to\u2028\nget to know that I am a homosexual, and for him to be ashamed of\u2028\nme,\u201d he says. \u201cI think that Allah\u2028\nwill come to punish me.\u201d\u2028\nFazal, with an 18-year-old-lover, prays that one day \u201cI will see\u2028\nthe light and stop this sin\u201d. His\u2028\nparents want to arrange a wedding\u2028\nfor him, although he would rather\u2028\nget a wife on his own, \u201cWith time\u2028\nthings change, and I might get used\u2028\nto a heterosexual relationship,\u201d he\u2028\nsays. He would like to move to Dubai, where he could Live anonymously. \u201cThere 1 would not have\u2028\nto deal with the heartache of being\u2028\ndespised and children calling one\u2028\nin the street msenge.\u201d\u2028\nOthers, such as Eric believe that\u2028\nit is society rather than homosexual\u2028\nmen who should change. But few\u2028\nwould go so far as in Zimbabwe\u2028\nand Botswana or Europe and north\u2028\nAmerica, where organisations of\u2028\ngay men have been estabLished. In\u2028\nthe 1960s, there was an attempt to\u2028\nform a gay club in Nairobi, when\u2028\nmen met at the Pop-In restaurant\u2028\n(now closed). In the early 1970s,\u2028\nanother Nairobi restaurant was\u2028\npopular until Street fights erupted\u2028\nbetween women sex workers and\u2028\ngay men. Later, they got together\u2028\nat the Club 1900 until the Government cracked down on the club,\u2028\nciting drugs as the reason. Today,\u2028\nthe locales where men who have\u2028\nsex with men can meet are well\u2028\nknown to those \u201cin the know\u201d, but\u2028\nnone advertise. Furthermore, since\u2028\nhomosexuality in Kenya is considered a criminal act, few men are\u2028\nwilling to \u201ccome out\u201d \u2014 to openly admit their homosexuality and\u2028\nto demand a place for gay men in\u2028\nKenyan society.\u2028\nThe stories of many men reveal\u2028\nthat most are pressured into marriage. Some wives know of their\u2028\nhusband\u2019s sexual and emotional\u2028\nrelationships with other men,\u2028\nwhile other wives remain ignorant.\u2028\nAmin, the primary school head\u2028\nmaster, for example, has an unspoken agreement with his wife of 26\u2028\nyears. She knows that he prefers\u2028\nmen, while he only \u201cbothered with.\nher\u201d to have their three children.\u2028\nKarim in Mombasa has intimacy\u2028\nwith his wife on Wednesdays and\u2028\nSaturdays, but does not enjoy it.\u2028\nWere she to walk away from the\u2028\nmarriage, he says he would not\u2028\nbother to marry again.\u2028\nThere are cases of heterosexual\u2028\nwives finding out that their husbands are bisexual. Some seek\u2028\ncounselling, hoping that the husband will change, or they simply\u2028\nwalk out if they are economically\u2028\nindependent. Frank Njenga, of the\u2028\nKenya Medical Association, recently handled a case where a\u2028\nwoman found her husband and a\u2028\nmale family friend in the matrimonial bed when she came home unexpectedly. The woman brought\u2028\nher husband for counselling. He\u2028\nagreed to stop having sex with men\u2028\nand stopped for some time only to\u2028\ngo back to his old ways. The couple are now separated. \nIn another case, an accountant\u2028\nheard rumours about her husband\u2028\nfrom her gardener and carne home\u2028\none afternoon to find him in bed\u2028\nwith the cook. She says, \u201cI could\u2028\nnot live with him another day, I\u2028\nmoved into a hotel to sort out my\u2028\nfeelings and to consult my lawyer.\u201d Because of the children, it\u2028\nwas the husband who eventually\u2028\nhad to move out. Julie is still receiving psychological counselling.\u2028\nHow much women are at risk of\u2028\ncontracting HIV from their husbands\u2019 affairs is uncertain, Often,\u2028\nthere is little sexual contact between them, although even one act\u2028\nof intercourse is enough to transmit\u2028\nthe virus often condom is not used. A\u2028\nfew men are careful to protect\u2028\nthemselves and their wives by using condoms with their male partners. Others believe they are not at\u2028\nrisk. Abdul, mentioned above,\u2028\ndoes riot use condoms because \u2018I\nam faithful to my partner and to my\u2028\nwife\u201d.\u2028\nWith no official information to\u2028\nguide them, few men who have sex\u2028\nwith men are persuaded to use\u2028\ncondoms on a regular basis. Some\u2028\nof the men interviewed said they\u2028\ndid not use condoms with their\u2028\nwives on the grounds that to do so\u2028\nwould invite suspicion. Further\u2028\nmore, they argued, there is no risk\u2028\nsince they had only one male part\u2028\nner lo whom they are faithful. (In\u2028\nfact, there is a risk if a partner is\u2028\nunfaithful or contracted HIV before the couple began having sex).\u2028\nThose who have multiple partners\u2028\nsay they \u201cay\u201d to use condoms, but\u2028\nthe word itself suggests they some\u2028\ntimes or often fail.\u2028\nOf the men interviewed, only\u2028\nKarim uses condoms all the time,\u2028\nalthough he calls them \u201ccumber\u2028\nsome\u201d. Many others, such as AM\u2028\nul and F?zal, consider. that fidelity\u2028\nprotects them, Odongo sees no\u2028\nneed for protection; while Jared\u2028\nbelieves that with young \u201cuntainted\u201d boys he is safe, Amin occasionally uses condoms, believing\u2028\nthat he cannot get HIV/Aids if he\u2028\ngoes out with \u201cfresh\u201d men.\u2028\nKassim, 19, of Mombasa has\u2028\njust completed high school and\u2028\nwould like to become a computer\u2028\nprogrammer. He admits that he has\u2028\nbeen promiscuous and that even\u2028\nthough he is aware of Aids he does\u2028\nnot use a condom, \u201cWhy spoil the\u2028\nfun?\u201d he asks, adding, \u201cI hope\u2028\nthat I won\u2019t get Aids,\u201d Indeed,\u2028\nmany of the men interviewed prefer to have sex without condoms.\u2028\nOthers cited the fact that stronger\u2028\ncondoms for homosexuals are not\u2028\navailable in Kenya and the regular\u2028\ncondoms they use tend to tear easily and are, therefore, ineffective.\u2028\nTo he continued tomorrow"}
