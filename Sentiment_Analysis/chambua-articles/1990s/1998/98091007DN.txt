{"text": "Churches to blame not NGOs \nCatholic bishops, some Protestant church leaders,\nMuslims and members of other religious\norganisations are accusing non-governmental\norganisations of misleading young people by\nissuing them with free condoms as part of their\ncampaign to curb the spread of HIV infections.\nThese religious groups are also blaming the\nNGOs for pushing for the immediate introduction\nof Family Life Education in schools where\nthese devices can easily be served.\nIn a show of anger against the activities of\nthe NGOs, the Catholic bishops and Muslim\nleaders three years ago set on fire cartons containing\nthousands of condoms and books published\nby the Scout movement on the Subject of\nfamily life to demonstrate to the world that '\nthey cared for the morality of Kenyan youth.\nIf indeed all of us are concerned about the\nplight of our teenagers, 'we must make sure that\nwe protect them from all dangers, including\nthe provision of condoms.\nThe Catholic bishops and other churches\nshould realise that burning condoms and books\nwill not prevent the manufacture of more\ncondoms and publishing of more books on\nfamily life, neither will it stop the issuing of\ncondoms to teenagers. What these church leaders should know is\nthat birth control centres existed in Kenya even\nbefore independence. The first clinic for birth\ncontrol was opened in Nairobi in 1955. The\nsecond was established in Mombasa in 1956.\nThese two clinics were later merged into the\nFamily Planning Association of Kenya which\nwas affiliated to the International Planned Parenthood\nFederation (IPPF) in 1963.\nIn 1985, the Marie Stopes International\nPartner Organisation was established in\nKenya, being the third largest reproductive\nhealth NGO in the country.\nIts clinics, which have no external funding\ncurrently, operate in urban areas and rural\ncommunities, like those in Mathare Valley in\nNairobi and western Kenya, especially in Bungoma\nand the Nyanza districts.\nSince its establishment, the organisation has\nserved millions of young Kenyans with free\ncondoms which they are encouraged to use\nthem to prevent HIV infections.\nThe organisation has specific youth programmes\nwhere peer education raises awareness\nabout sexual health and birth control to\nenable schoolgirls to continue with their education. One thing that is very clear is that the Government\nis aware of this and works in collaboration\nwith the NGOs active in this area. In\nfact, even some churches also world. with them.\nUnder the slogan Tetea Vijana, the\nPlanned Parenthood in Kenya works in conjunction\nwith the National Council of\nChurches of Kenya (NCCK), to safeguard the\nlives of teenagers against the danger of HIV/Aids.\nIn July 1995, the Kenya Youth Initiative\nProject co-sponsored a national youth workshop\nwith the NCCK which attracted more\nthan 100 young people. The workshop was\nalso attended by more than 400 senior clergy,\nincluding bishops and moderators of some of\nProtestant churches in Kenya to press for the\nintroduction of Family Life Education in\nschools.\nChurch leaders, divided as they are on\nwhether or not Family Life Education should\nbe introduced in schools with the possibility of\nissuing the young people with more condoms,\nshould not blame the NGOs. Instead, we\nshould blame ourselves.\nFr Joachim Omolo Ouko,\nBrooklvn, New York,\nEnact tough Law on Aids\nAs the constitutional reform debate continues, the issue of HIV/Aids and related problems should be discussed.\nI am particularly concerned about the HIV infected people who knowingly infect other with the disease. \nI know of a woman in Kisumu Town who of a women in Kisumu Town who knowingly infected an unsuspecting lover.\nShe is said to have forged laboratory test result from hospitals showing that she is HIV negative. She uses these to lure her victims.\nI feel a law should be enacted to deter this malicious and reckless behaviour by some people who have been diagnosed as being HIV positive.\nUnless this is done some of the victims may be forced to take the law in their own hands and seek revenge. And one way of doing so would be to resort to killing their tormentors. \nThis issue should be taken seriously to protect healthy people, particularly youth who may be taken in by these sick people.\nA Victim\nKisumu "}
