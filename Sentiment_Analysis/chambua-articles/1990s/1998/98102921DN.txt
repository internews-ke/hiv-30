{"text": "Anonymous HIV testing key to early treatment\nStudy in US cities details positive outcome\nBy BRENDA C. COLEMAN\nCHICAGO. Wednesday\nAnonymous screening for the\nAids virus leads to people getting\ntested and treated much earlier, a\nstudy found.\nBut where name-linked testing\nis required - as it is now in II\nstates - public clinics have seen\nno significant decline in the number\nof people tested, another study\nfound.\nIn confidential testing, the person's\nname is linked to test results\nin a medical chart and kept on file\nat health departments to prevent\ncases from being tracked more\nthan once. The names are stripped\nbefore results are sent to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.\nIn anonymous testing, only a\nnumber is recorded with the test\nresult, never a name.\nFederal authorities favour the\navailability of both. They say\nname reporting is the only way to\ntrack the\u00b7 epidemic, but anonymous\ntesting may help curb it by\ngetting people into treatment earlier.\n.\n\"The history of this disease has\nbeen a little different than ... other\ndiseases, because we haven't had\na therapy until recently that was highly effective,\" said Dr Allyn\nK. Nakashima, lead author of one\nstudy and a CDC medical epidemiologist.\nPublic reluctance to give names\nto public health officials for testing\nhas eased, since a person's anonymity\ndisappears when he or\nshe becomes a patient, she said,\nThe CDC studied' about\n459,000 tests at health departments\nin six states before and after\npublic clinics implemented reporting\nof names of people who\ntested positive for HIV, the virus that causes Aids.\nName reporting did not appear\nto diminish the use of testing in\nthe states studied - Louisiana,\nMichigan, Nebraska, Nevada,\nNew Jersey and Tennessee - the\nCDC said in Wednesday's Journal\nof the American Medical\nAssociation.\nName reporting has been required\nsince 1981 in all American\nstates for full-blown Aids and has\nbeen routine even longer in all\nstates for other diseases ranging\nfrom tuberculosis to gonorrhea\nand salmonella poisoning.\n\nBut only 11 states require name reporting of HIV-positive tests.\nA separate study in JAMA found that where anonymous testing was also offered as a publicly funded alternative - as it is now in\n39 states- people who were eventually diagnosed with Aids sought HIV tests and HIV-related treatment much earlier than other patients.\nHIV related treatment aver aged more than a year earlier in anonymous group, the study found.\n\"That is one of the biggest positive effect of any public health \nprogramme anywhere, eadauthor, Dr Andrew Bindman of Francisco General Hospital Medical Centre.\nTheir study involved 835 patients in Arizona/Colorado, Missouri, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon and Texas. North Carolina has - since mandated name reporting of HIV tests.\nEarly testing and treatment not only prolongs patients lives but allows them to take precautions to\nprevent spreading the disease, the\nresearchers noted.
