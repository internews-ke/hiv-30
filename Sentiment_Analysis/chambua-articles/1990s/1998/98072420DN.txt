{"text": "Heavy migration linked to the spread of Aids\nBy ROSE LUKALO\nA third of the world's people are\non the move - many migrating to\nfind safer homes or better economic\nopportunities - and a fact\nwhich researchers want more attention\npaid to because of the impact\nthis has on the spread of\nHIV /Aids.\n\"It is understood there are over\ntwo billion people on the move\nglobally,\" Ms Irene Fernandez,\nchairperson of the non-governmental\norganisation CARAM -\nor Coordination of Action Research\non AIDS and Migration -\ntold the Geneva Aids conference\nrecently.\nWhile the majority are businesspeople\nand tourists who return\nto their homes after a few\ndays or weeks abroad, more than\n50 million people are economic\nmigrants or refugees, according to\nthe Johns Hopkins School of Public\nHealth in Baltimore, US.\nMs Fernandez says that in the\nrush to globalise, governments\nrace to negotiating tables eager for a piece of the economic miracle\nbeing promised but ignoring the\nimpact on the spread of HIV/Aids.\n\"This economic model only\nconcerns itself with profit and\ncapital accumulation. The human\nbeing is only secondary to the\nagenda,\" says Fernandez, criticising\nthe donor agencies International\nMonetary Fund and the\nWorld Bank for \"policies that\nwork against the health of people\nincluding the privatisation of\nhealth services and the exploitation\nof cheap labour markets\".\nAccording to a 1996 report by\nthe Johns Hopkins School, an estimated\n16 million people migrate\neach year from rural to urban\nareas of developing countries, excluding\nChina. Another two to\nfour million migrate internationally\neach year, some 18 million\nhave fled their own countries as\nrefugees in the last two decades\nand about 20 million are internally\ndisplaced.\nThese are among the most vulnerable. In, developing world, governments\nroutinely assist their people\nto migrate to other countries as a\nmeans of earning foreign exchange.\nBut the conditions of migration\nproduce risks. Most migrants\nare unmarried or must\nleave their partners behind; and\nwhile they are largely seen as\nmere economic tools, their sexual\nneeds make them vulnerable to\nHIV/Aids.\nParticipants in Geneva were\npresented with research findings\nfrom a survey of Bosnian women\nworking in Germany indicating\nthat the loneliness generated by\nisolation and lack of family support\nstructures are major contributors\nto sexual activity.\nPointing to the wide variation\nin the incidence of HIV from one\ncountry to another and even within\na single country, researcher Josef\nDecosas claims there is a correlation\nbetween HIV and the\nmovement associated with labour\nmarket, with high rates of the virus\nfound in areas of frequent economic migration.\nFor instance, Decosas links the\nspread of the epidemic in Southern\nAfrica to the strong economy\npresented by South Africa and the\nhistory of migrant labour from\nneighbouring countries which service\nthe mining industry.\nDecosas' research is one of\u00b7\nonly a small number of studies investigating\nthe relationship between\nHIV transmission and migration.\nA network of experts in\nthe field, going by the name of\nMonitoring the AIDS Pandemic\n(MAP), reports that the studies\nwhich have been undertaken tend\nto focus on highly mobile populations\nsuch as truck drivers and\nitinerant traders, whose lives are\nstructured very differently from\nmigrant labourers'.\nLarge-scale migration is also\ncaused by war and conflict. In\nthese situations finding food and\nshelter is a priority and Aids is often\noverlooked. However, it is just\nat such times that Aids threatens\nmost, says UNAids, the United Nations' Aids wing. Refugees from high and low areas of HIV\nprevalence are thrown together as\nincidents of rape and violence rise\ndramatically, leaving men and\nwomen highly vulnerable to the\ndisease.\nTens and thousands of women\nHave been raped in conflict situations\n- whether in Bosnia-Herzegovina\nor Rwanda. Rape is used,\nas an instrument of war across the\nworld. Conflicts are also thought\nto lead to other behaviour which\nincreases the risks of being infected\nwith HIV - displaced men and\nwomen, stranded without their\nloved ones, interact sexually both\namong themselves and with the\nhost community.\nUnprotected sex in such circumstances\ncan cause sexually\ntransmitted diseases which in turn\nmake men and women more vulnerable\nto HIV infection.\nAccording to Ms Millicent\nObaso, who works in eastern\nAfrica for the International Federation\nof Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, more than 250 rapes were reported over seven\nmonths in just one district of western\nTanzania, a region where\nmore than 230,000 Burundian and\nCongolese refugees are sheltered.\nOther conditions associated\nwith forced migration and displacement,\nsuch as overcrowded\nand unhygienic living conditions\nand unsafe abortions, also assist\nthe spread of HIV/Aids.\nMarina Mahathir of the Malaysian\nAids Council wants regional,\ntrans-border and international cooperation\nbetween countries\nprioritised as a means of dealing\nwith HIV/Aids and migration and\nfinding ways of sharing costs.\nMr Michael Carael, who coordinates\nmigration policy and programmes\nat UNA ids, says that\nthere should be education and programmes\non HIV/Aids for migrants,\nadding: \"Interventions\nshould be directed at risk reduction,\nand the human rights of migrants\nshould be respected. \"\n(PANOS)"}
