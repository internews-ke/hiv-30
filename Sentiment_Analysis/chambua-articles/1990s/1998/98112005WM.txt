{"text": "Regional drama festival for Kisumu\nUgandan groups to attend event\n\nBy PETER KIMANI\nTheatre enthusiasts in Kisumu are in for a major\ntreat as Misango Arts Ensemble put final touches\nto a regional arts festival scheduled for December.\nThis is the second treat for the\nlakeside town this year, having\nhosted the International Drama/Education Association congress in\nJuly.\nThis time round, it is the\nKisumu based group that has organised the drama festival, set totake place between December 19 and 21 in a venue that's yet to be\nconfirmed.\nAbout 20 Ugandan groups have\nconfirmed participation, including\nMasaka Theatre Artists, Kalabana, Vetu Company, Gula U.D.T.A, Ndere Troupe and the Ugandan National Theatre.\nThe tour by Ugandan groups\ncomes a year after Misango Arts\ntoured Uganda following similar\ninvitations by the Ugandan teams\ncourtesy of the Ugandan National\nTheatre.\nUnder the guidance of founding \ndirector Obat Masira, the group\npresented their repertoire that included\nAfter A Long Illness, a play that arddresses Aids/HIV; and\nNo Retreat, No Surrender, a captivating gender-oriented play.\nThe troupe also presented, \ndances in a cast that featured Razel Oluoch, Maureen Kemunto,\nLeonard Akwang, Collin Omondi\nEric Onyango and Eric Owira,\namong others.\n\"We thought it fair to invite\nUgandan troupes here, so that\nKenyans who are not acquainted\nwith Ugandan culture can catch a.\nglimpse of it,\" explains Masira.\nBesides sounding noble, this is\nan exemplification of the spirit of\nnetworking that Masira has often\nemployed successfully.\nMoreover, the performances\nwould serve as a good yardstick to\ntest the popularity of Ugandan\nplays in Kenya, Masira adds.\nFor there is no doubt that Ugandans\nliked what Kenyans offered,\nwhich is partly why they have already\ninvited the Kenyan troupe\nto return next year.\nbut beyond these invitations,\nMasira says, there were lessons to\nbe learnt including how a supportive\nGovernment can help change\nthe direction of theatre.\n\"The Ugandan National Theatre\nis managed by theatre personalities,\nand not by civil servants\nwho have never watched a production,\"\nsays the man who admits\nthat political goodwill is\nquite manifest in Uganda as seen\nin the number of political leaders\nwho patronise theatre, \u2022\n\"There is space for artists in\nUganda,\" he says, adding that the\nrise and rise of theatre in uganda\nhas something to do with the collapse of the film industry in that\ncountry. Many resorted to theatre\nas the only form of entertainment.\nBut the bottom line in the\nKisumu festival is that local artistes\nare networking with others\nto ensure there is entertainment\nfor all.\nThis is not something new' for\nMasira; he's been receiving invitations\nto perform in many countries\nsince 1986 when he went to\nBritain on a youth exchange\nprogramme, and directed Joe de-\nGraft's Muntu.\nIt was during the 6-month congress\nthat Misango Arts was\nfounded, and the group has been\nplodding on gently over the past\ndecade, trying to live up to its\nideals, which are to bring change\nand development through theatre:\n\"We have been able to make\ninroads to bring development,\"\nsays Masira reflectively.\nMasira says it has not been easy\nfor the group, which has been involved\nin many projects in\nKisumu, not to mention giving\nconsultancy to groups wishing to\nuse theatre to reach their targeted\naudience.\n\"The struggle has been long,\"\nhe says. \"Some paid with their\nlives, others went into exile. But\nthe future looks promising.\"\nWell, this is not the time to take\nstock of the dim past but to celebrate\nnot just the end of the year,\nbut also the festival ahead,\n\nMisango Arts leader, Masira Obat: \"Government support is\nimportant for theatre development.\" The Kisumu festival will offer\nKenyans a chance to have a glimpse of Ugandan theatre.\n\nMombasa group to stage Aids play\nBv NGUMBAO KITHI\nThe House of Dreams (Mwambao),\na household name in the theatre\nscene in Mombasa, has come\nup with yet another thrilling and\neducative play, Majuto, to be\nstaged throughout the country.\nThe first performance will be at\nthe Mombasa Polytechnic on\nNovember 22, followed by another\none during the National Artnet\nfestival on November 26-29 at the\nKenya National Theatre, Nairobi.\nMajuto is a story of a minister's\nson who has contracted HIV/Aids. His father kicks him out\nof the house thinking he got infected\nthrough immorality.\nThe misguided father later\nfinds out that this' was not the\ncase.\nThe cast members are Yusuf\nMohammed (Minister), Suleiman\nShambe (Baba Dola), Mbashir\nShambi (Majuto), Andrew Musakale\n(Pharaoh/Permanent Secretary).\nCaroline Rita (the minister's wife), Maggie Mbetsa\n(Mama Dola), Halima O.
