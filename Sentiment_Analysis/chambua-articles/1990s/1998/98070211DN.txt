{"text": "HIV virus still eludes drugs\nGENEVA (Switzerland),\nWednesday\nLeading Aids experts held out hope for a vaccine within a decade and warned that even the most potent triple drug combinations are not eliminating the HIV virus in infected patients.\n\nDrug cocktails including the latest protease inhibitors can reduce the virus that causes Aids to, undetectable levels in patients but there is still a latent reservoir, or pool, of infected 'cells in every patient.\n\n'I can never say never in biology,\" said Dr Anthony Fauci of the US National Institutes of Health, \"but so long as we've looked it seems it is going to be very, very difficult to truly eliminate and eradicate this pool. \"\n\nDr Fauci and other scientists told the 12th World Aids Conference that every patient, even those in successful therapy for three or more years, have the latent pool which is formed early in infection and remains despite the most effective treatment.\n\nThe virus can lurk in lympathic cells anywhere in the body but are most likely to be found in lymph nodes, the spleen or the brain.\n\"It's a very small pool but it's a very important pool because we know that it is the engine that gets reignited without therapy,\" Dr Fauci told a press conference.\n\n\"We need to deal with this reservoir and we need to deal with it creatively.\u201d\n\nDr David Ho, of the Aaron Diamond Aids Research Centre in New York, in response to a question said US President Bill Clinton's call last year for scientists to produce a vaccine within a decade was possible.\n\n\"It's a tall order, but it doesn't seem unreasonable. \"\n\nBut like Dr Fauci and Dr Robert Silician, of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore who presented similar research, Dr Ho's main concern and the focus of his research is the latent reservoir.\n\nHo said that despite successful combination therapy the virus is lurking and reproducing, although to different degrees in patients. One theory is that the antiviral drugs may not be adequately delivered to the latent pool.\n\n\"The challenge to eliminate HIV from an infected person remains;\" Dr Ho said during his presentation earlier on Tuesday.\nScientists are not sure if, or how quickly, the pool diminishes with long-term drug therapy and are\nlooking at strategies to eliminate or control it, possibly by boosting the body's immune system.\n\nDr Fauci admitted \"it was sobering news about the reality of where we are\" but stressed that combination therapy has dramatically changed the lives of many HIV patients.\n\nThe problem now is how to tackle those residual cells. Otherwise patients face 10 or more years on combination therapy or risk regression if they discontinue treatment.\n\nGiven the difficulty of taking the complicated assortment of pills every day and the build-up of toxicity, such long-term treatment may not be feasible for many patients.\n\nThe scientists noted that some patients have come off therapy with no ill effects and that there are long-term non-progressors who are infected but manage to bring the virus under control themselves.\n\nDr Ho said it is \"achievable naturally, although rarely.\"\nHe called for intensified treatment to get a true impression of how persistent the latent reservoir is.\n\n\"We have a lot to do,\" admitted Dr Fauci. (Reuters)\n\nCases of obesity, diabetes Increase\nGENEVA. Wednesday\nDrugs which have contributed to dramatic decline in Aids death rates could be a cause of extreme shifts in body fat and diabetes, experts said today.\n\n'This is a very large problem, \"Dr David Cooper, an Australian expert in HIV, said at the Conference.\nResearch has shown that users of protease inhibitors, which stop HIV from multiplying, have suffered unusual fattening. Women treated with the drugs have experienced breast enlargement.\n\nThe treatments have also been associated with increased triglyceride and cholesterol levels, which can lead to greater risk of heart disease, say specialists.\n\nIn a study by Krista Dong of the Miriam Hospital in Providence, Rhode Island, in the United States, and researchers at the Brown University in Providence,\n19 out of list women treated with a protease inhibitor were said to have complained of changes in their bodies. \"\nSome 71 per cent of the women are reported to have said their breasts got bigger, a further 71 per cent complained of an enlarged abdomen, 47 per cent said their limbs had wasted and 23 per cent said they were experiencing so called \"buffalo hump\" \u2013abnormal fat in the neck and shoulders.\n\nIn another study of 110 HIV positive patients at the Civic Hospital in Lugano, Switzerland, researcher\nEnos Bernasconi and others said they observed higher cholesterol levels in patients treated with inhibitors against those who received other forms of treatment.\n\nResearch carried out by Dr Ravi K. Walli and colleagues at the University of Munich in Germany showed use of inhibitors in therapy is linked with the occurrence of irreversible hyperglycemia and manifest diabetes mellitus. (AP)"}
