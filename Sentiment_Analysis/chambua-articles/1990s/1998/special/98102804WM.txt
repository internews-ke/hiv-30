{"text": "NATION, MARCH 2, 1998\n\nAZT: Third World women to benefit\n\nA quick treatment that could cut in\nhalf the number of HIV-infected\ninfants born in developing countries\nmay be more difficult and expensive\nthan initially suggested,\nsay US health officials.\nFirst, doctors must diagnose the\n2 million HIV-infected women\nwho will get pregnant each year in\ndeveloping countries - nations\nthat now have little testing for the\nAids virus, the officials say. Then,\nthey must keep the healthy babies\nfrom being infected by breastfeeding,\nLast month, scientists discovered\nthat three to four weeks of\nAZT therapy\u00b7 during the end of\npregnancy cut in half the number\nof infected babies born to HIV-infected\nmothers.\nAZT maker Glaxo Wellcome\nreacted by slashing the drug's\nprice for developing countries, to\nbetween US$50 to US$150 per\nwoman. The 26-week AZT therapy\ngiven to US women costs\nUS$800 to US$1,000.\nStill, \"there are some really\nmajor challenges in turning this\ninto a reality for the hundreds of\nthousands\u00b7 of children who are infected\nevery year ,\" said\nNils Daulaire of the U.S. Agency\nfor International Development,\n(USAID) which spends US$120 million on Aids programmes\nworldwide. The U.N Programme\non HIV/Aids has called international\nexperts to Geneva on Monday\nto plan how to get short AZT\ntherapy to developing countries.\nAids testing is largely unknown\nin these regions. USAID has begun\nHIV counselling and testing\nprogrammes in 14 developing\ncountries, at a cost of US$25 per\nperson. The question is how to\nfind an estimated 2 million HIV infected\npregnant women each\nyear at a more affordable price,\nDaulaire said Friday.\nThen comes the AZT. Even at\nUS$50 to U5$150, that's \"several\ntimes the amount normally\nspent on all prenatal obstetric\ncare\" in developing countries,\nDaulaire said.\nFinally, doctors must keep protecting\nthe healthy infants: If their\nHIV-infected mothers breastfeed\none in six of the babies will catch\nthe virus that way, he said.\nHealth experts for years have\ntried to increase breastfeeding ill\ndeveloping countries because mothers' milk is such good nutrition.\nGiven that, doctors must figure out how to curb nursing by HIV-infected mothers without\nhanging that bigger message, he\nsaid.\n-AP"}
