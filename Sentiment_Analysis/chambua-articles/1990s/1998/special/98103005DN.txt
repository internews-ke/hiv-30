{"text": "Banditry\nspeeds up\nspread\nof Aids\nKARAMA Isiolo, Tuesday\nOnce considered some of the\n\"safest grounds\" in Kenya, pastoral\nareas are now bearing the\nbrunt of the HIV/Aids pandemic.\nThat the infection rate in this\nEastern Province of Kenya district,\nwhich was three per cent\nfour years ago, is now estimated\nto be between 20 and 30 per cent\nis worrying. Aids is a fatal disease\nspreading extremely fast in\nthe district, states the District Development\nPlan for the period\n1997-200l.\nThe situation has been exacerbated\nby banditry, which has become\nsynonymous with the\nnorthern frontier districts of\nKenya. In what appears to be a\nsystematised way of dehumanising\ntheir victims, bandits not only\nloot property and drive away\nlivestock when they strike, but\nthey also rape women, children\nand men!\n\"Aids infected bandits have\npassed on the dreaded HIV virus\nto women, children and men\nalike during their sporadic raids\nin the district,\" a nurse at the\nIsiolo District Hospital, Mrs Pauline\nKinyua, says.\nOut of every five women and\nchildren raped during the last one\nand a half years, she says, two\nhave been infected with sexually\n_transmitted diseases (STDs), including\nHIV ..\nThe youngest recorded rape\nvictim was a four-year-old girl,\nwhile the oldest was a 72-yearold\ngrandmother, says Ms Kinyua,\nwho is attached to a home\nfor people with Aids and orphans,\n.known as \"Pepo la Tu\"\nmaini Jangwani\" (PT1), Kiswahili\nfor \"Wind of Hope in the\nWilderness\".\nThe story of Fatuma (not real\nname), who was simultaneously\nraped with her mother by a group\nof bandits, is spine-chilling.\nAccording to Ms Kinyua, the\n12-year-old girl now suffers from\na chronic STD and fears that, like\nher mother, she may have been\ninfected with HIV.\nAnother PTJ resident (name\nwithheld), whose wife has since\ndied of Aids, describes how his\nwife was raped in his presence in\nthe middle of last year by bandits\nwho also forcefully had anal sex\nwith him as their two young children\nwatched. \"I tried to fight them off but I\nwas overpowered,\" says the sickly man, who has since, tested HIV\npositive. \"My wife had persistent\nvaginal bleeding after the ordeal\nuntil she died seven months\nlater. \"\nBanditry in this district has\ncaused untold suffering to locals\nincluding murder, rape, abduction,\ntorture, looting and arbitrary\narrests.\nAccording to Mr Dabar Abdi\nMaalim of the Department of\nPublic Health, Moi University, in\na previous interview with IRIS,\nbandit activities in northern\nKenya are clearly commercial,\nwith violence and terror geared\ntowards achieving maximum\nmonetary gain.\nBandits\nThe current brand of banditry\nis geared towards robbing victims\nof their property, especially land.\nThose interviewed by IRIS noted\nthat bandits are using crude dehumanising\nmethods such as rape\nand sodomy to break families and\nforce them out of their land.\n\"It is embarrassing to be\nstripped naked together with your\nwife and children and be raped in\nturns! Whenever this happens,\nmembers of the affected family\nscatter in different directions, unable\nto endure the ordeal,\" Mr\nAbdi Isaak, a local resident, says.\nThe government should step in\nand arrest the situation immediately,\npleads Mr Isaak. \"How can we\nbe made women as the state\nwatches?\" the embittered 40-\nyear-old-man asked.\nOn the other hand., the deceptively\nlow incidence of reported\ncases of Aids among pastoral\ncommunities of eastern and\nnorth-eastern Kenya has duped\nlocals into complacency as the\ndeadly virus runs amok.\n\"Most people still believe that\nAids is a disease of urban non pastoral\npeople, and unless this\nnotion is corrected, the disease is\ngoing to wipe us out in a very\nshort period,\" warns Mrs Khadija\nRama, PTJ founder.\nMrs Rama adds that the local\ncommunity has turned a deaf ear\nPAGE 23 - COL 3\nPepo la Tumaini Jangwani (Wind of Hope in the Wilderness), a home for people with Aids and orphans in the outskirts of Isiolo Town.
