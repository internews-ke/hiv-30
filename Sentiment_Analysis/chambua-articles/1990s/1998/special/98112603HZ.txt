Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Uganda and\u2028\nVietnam to take part in the project the initiative the four\u2028\ncountries arc expected to adapt\u2028\ntheir health infrastructures to ensure effective distribution and the\u2028\nuse of the drugs while participating pharmaceutical and diagnostic\u2028\ncompanies will subsidize purchases of the appropriate drugs.\u2028\nsays Horizons-\u2028\nIn each participating country,\u2028\nship dances have also served to\u2028\nminimise the negative aspects of\u2028\nthe generation gap between the\u2028\nolder and younger generations.\u2028\nThis difference is enhanced where the children acquire more academic education than their parents.\u2028\nIn all cases, the generation gap\u2028\nreaches us peak when the children\u2028\nbecome adolescents with puberty.\u2028\nThis is because the generation differences are tested lo the limit due to differences in the values held\u2028\nby either generation,\u2028\nSonic of the solutions of the\u2028\ngeneration gap include the harmonisation of the cultural values\u2028\nof parents with those of their children. especially the adolescents\u2028\nThey also include the organisation, by parents. of appropriate so\u2028\ntwo new entities will be created,\u2028\nwhose activities will be monitored\u2028\nby UNAIDS. These area\u2028\nCIA national aids drugs advisory\u2028\nboard, under the ministry for health . which will devise a co-ordinated national policy for the\u2028\nprovision of tise needed drugs.\u2028\nU A non-profit company which\u2028\nwill act as a clearing house for\u2028\nplacing orders, say well as being a\u2028\nrecipient( and a channel for the\u2028\nsubsidies from the companies.\u2028\nFinancing for the intuitive will\u2028\ncome from pharmaceutical companies. subsidies, health ministries and UNAIDS.\u2028\nParticipating companies will\u2028\nmake available a range of aids related\u2028\ndrugs, including anti-retro\u2028\nvirals (new cocktail drugs). In addition. diagnostic companies will\u2028\nprovide virological services.\u2028\nactivities Lo enable children\u2028\nand adolescents to meet members\u2028\nof the opposite sex under valued\u2028\nguidance. \u2018today, parents them\u2028\nselves need to learn continually\u2028\nabout adolescent development so\u2028\nthat they can then competently\u2028\nhelp the young people in preparing for marriage Parent-c must\u2028\nrealize that adolescent courtship\u2028\nrelationships develop as a result of\u2028\nnatural sexuality changes and not\u2028\nto anything else the\u2028\nyoung persons might have done.\u2028\nEverything they do as a result\u2028\nof the changes is therefore a new\u2028\nexperience and causes many questions in their minds These questions muy be answered by parents\u2028\nas they rise. If the parents do not\u2028\nknow the answers it is their responsibility to make appropriate\u2028\narrangements with professional\u2028\nwho can provide the\u2028\nanswers.\u2028\nParents can also help the young\u2028\npeople to perform drama on aids,\u2028\nadolescent development, marriage and family development.\u2028\nThe various parts of the drama are\u2028\nprepared and acted by the teen\u2028\nagers themselves, In this way, the\u2028\nadolescents become the most \neducators among themselves. They are able to create effective communication \u00a1md close\u2028\nwhatever gaps there may be. Furthermore, they are able so integrate the messages into their own\u2028\ncultural and emotional lives.\u2028\n...\u2028\nOur against aids are in\u2028\nhelping young persons to\u2028\norganize and perform drama\u2028\non aids, adolescent development, courtship values . and\u2028\nethics, marriage and family\u2028\ndevelopment\u2028\n...\u2028\nIn communities, young girls\u2028\nhave been able to meet boys and\u2028\nother girls at dances which have\u2028\nbeen organised and supervised by\u2028\nparents.

As\u2028\nsoon as they got onto thy field, a\u2028\nleader would sian them off by doing some dancing himself.\u2028\nThe boys and girls would then\u2028\narrange themselves lacing each\u2028\nother. They would start dancing\u2028\nwhile searching for mates. They\u2028\nwould use various signals to \nthe chosen male.\u2028\nThe parents would stay in the\u2028\nbackground to watch over the\u2028\ncourtship dancing Some o the\u2028\nparents would have idea be\u2028\nas to who was likely to\u2028\nbe chosen by their children. \u2028\nmight have influenced the choices\u2028\naccording lo their own family aspirations to be approved by there\u2028\nparents. .\u2028\nIn a village or community.\u2028\nthere would be several dances go-\u2028\n\u00a1ng on at the same time.
