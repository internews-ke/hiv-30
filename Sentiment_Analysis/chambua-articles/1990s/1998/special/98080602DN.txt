{"text": "Divorce rate, blamed on\nchange of social values\n\nAUGUST 6,1998\n\nOne of the most important\u2028\ncauses of marriage breakdowns\u2028\nis the constant change in social\u2028\nvalues with each generation.\u2028\nThese changes lead to changes in\u2028\ninterpretation of sexual\u2028\nbehavior. It is these value\u2028\nchanges that have led to an in\u2028\ncreasing proportion of all first\u2028\nbirths being conceived before\u2028\nmarriage and to the rapid spread\u2028\nof Aids.\u2028\nMany marrying today are\u2028\nmore concerned with trying to\u2028\nprove their fertility before marriage than with maintaining\u2028\nchastity. It must neverthless be\u2028\nemphasised that even though , most\u2028\nof the pregnancies are not intended and the pregnancy will\u2028\nhave occurred largely due to ignorance or carelessness.\u2028\nTherefore, it is necessary for\u2028\neach generation to develop increasingly higher ethical value\u2028\nsystem for the management of\u2028\ntheir courtship relationships.\u2028\nWhen pregnancy has occurred the marriage is then hastily arranged and with with little time being spent on courtship and marriage preparation. Most of these kinds of marriages therefore start of with probIems of\u2028\nemotional conflict based on ignorance, fear, guilt and shame\u2028\nwhich lead to marriage conflict\u2028\nand breakdown.\u2028\n...\u2028\nOur aids against Aids are in\u2028\npreventing hurriedly arranged marriages by educat\u2028ing the youth on adolescence\u2028\nand courtship values and\u2028\nethics.\u2028\n\u201cA marriage breakdown is  set of circumstances ,between spouses in which the needs of one or both\nare not met . It occurs as a result\nof failure of adjustment between\u2028\nthe spouses who then start think\u2028\ning of separation and divorce. \u2018\u2028\nThe children from those mar\u2028riages will then in turn grow up\u2028\nto establish the same type of\u2028\nmarriage and family development. The deterioration of marriage and family lift in society\u2028\nwill thus occur with each generation. This will in turn be complicated by increases in sexually\u2028\ntransmitted diseases such as\u2028\nAids, premarital coitus with unwanted pregnancies and children\u2028\nand abortions as continuing\u2028\nsymptoms of marriage\u2028\nbreakdown.\u2028\nWhen a spouse decides to seek\ndivorce, the principal reasons\u2028\ngiven are adjustment failure, In\u2028\nsome which have high divorce\u2028\nrates, the major reason is failure\u2028\nof sexual adjustment, heavy al\u2022\u2028\ncobol dnnking, adultery, cruelty\u2028\nor spouse abuse which could be\u2028\nphysical, mental and even spiritual.\u2028\nA hastily prepared marriage\u2028\nBrought by forces rather than\u2028\nmutual consent mostly end in divorce. In-laws also play a major\u2028\nrole to make or break a marriage.\u2028\nCouples this think of separation, divorce or resorting to extra\u2028\nmarital sexual relations when\u2028\ndifficulties arise because they\u2028\nhave not sufficiently prepared or adjusted to cope with the marriage situation.\n\nAbout 60 per cent of divorce cases occur during the first nine\u2028\nyears of marriage with the third\u2028\nyear of marriage producing more\u2028\ndivorces than any other. Separations however occur as early as\u2028\nthe first years of marriage.\u2028\nDivorcees tend to marry again again\u2028\nin search of satisfaction which\u2028\nthey failed to realise with their\u2028\nerevious partners. In the majority\u2028\nof cases it is the failure to get emotional satisfaction which lead to divorce.When the new marriage does not provide the expected satisfaction then it is back to square one.\u2028\nWhat couples do in difficult situations depend on the value they place on\u2028\nmarriage.If marriage and family\u2028\nlife are given high value by the\u2028\nsociety. marriage problems will\u2028\nbe handled with great thought,\u2028\npatience and careful discussion\u2028\nof what must be done to restore\u2028\nnormalcy.\u2028\nThe indicator of the value\u2028\nplaced on marriage is the rate of\u2028\nremarriage of the couples who\u2028\nget divorced\u2028\n..."}
