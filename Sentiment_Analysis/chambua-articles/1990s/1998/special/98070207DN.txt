{"text": "Why doctors went on strike\nGovernment doctors have been on strike for\nabout two weeks now. It is unfortunate that at\nthe end of the day, it is the patient who\nsuffers as a result of the strike. But did doctors\njust wake up one morning and decide to\ngo on strike?\nWe have been trying to talk to the relevant\nGovernment authorities about the implementation\nof the Muya Commission's report since\nlast December, but to no avail. ,\nInstead, what we have received is a barrage\nof negative remarks and discouragement. The\ndemand for the registration of the Kenya\nMedical Practitioners and Dentists Union\n(KMPDU) has arisen from the need to have a\ncovering body that can negotiate doctors'\n'working conditions with the Government as\nopposed to individual representation.\nThe KMPDU also has a mandate for improving\nthe standards of health services in the\ncountry as well are responsibility for health\neducation and other functions. I state this to\nemphasise the other roles of the KMPDU, as\nopposed to being a 'trade union'.\nWe are agitating for improvement of doctors'\nworking conditions as opposed to a salary\nincrease alone, although at the end of the\nday everything is measured in terms of monetary\nvalue.'\nAfter five or more years of hard work at the\nuniversity, the young doctor emerges into the\nemployment market earning a miserable salary\nof Sh6,000,a house allowance of Sh2,000,\nand the so-called 'responsibility allowance' of\nSh  600 (which is supposed to cater for the\novertime work done - although more often\nthan not doctors are subjected to working 80\nor more hours per week without off days).\nIn this era of Aids, it is important to have a\nreasonable degree of protection from infection\nby the HIV virus. How is a doctor (or nurse\nfor that matter) protected from infection\nwhen gloves are not available, and when they\nare available they are found to have holes. HIV infection is not the only disease doctors\nare exposed to by virtue of their occupation.\nWe are also exposed to a host of communicable\ndiseases including tuberculosis.\nUnfortunately, Government doctors receive\nno medical cover.\nDoctors are human beings and many are\nmarried with families. Being a doctor does not\nmean that you cannot get sick. With the skyrocketing\ncost of medical care in this country\nit is necessary for us to have medical insurance\ncover.\nNot so long ago, my colleague's child fell ill\nand had to be admitted to hospital for treatment.\nAlthough he worked for the Government,\nhe had to pay the cost of\nhospitalisation. Is this the kind of concern we\nexpect to receive from our employer?\nOur grievances are not just limited to remuneration\nand benefits. After a long day (and\nsometimes days) at work, it would be pleasant\nto come home to a decent house. We are not\ndemanding bungalows or mansions that many\nof our bosses in the administration occupy,\nbut we will not settle for leaking, rat-infested\nhouses that we are compelled to occupy due to\nour state of poverty.\nThe list of doctors grievances can go on and\non, but at the end of the day how the current\ncrisis is solved will determine the future of\ndoctors in the public service.\nAlthough many of us would like to serve our\ncountry, we cannot carry on working in miserable\nconditions given to us by the government,\nand the possibility of mass exodus of\ndoctors from Government service is a reality. Dr A. Kanji,\nNairobi.\nTruths about the Aids virus\nIt is true that some of our\nnational leaders have tended to\nmislead the public that condoms\nhave been contaminated with the\nAids virus.\nThe truth about the virus is\nthat it can only survive in blood,\nand also in body fluids like semen,\nsweat, vaginal fluids. It may\nalso be present in tears as recently\nreported in medical literature. If the virus is exposed to other\nenvironmental conditions, it dies\nwithin 17 seconds or so.\nCondoms are sterilised and\ntested before they are packaged,\nand there is no way the virus can\nsurvive the extremely high temperature\nthat the condoms are\nput through during autoclaving.\nJ.D.
