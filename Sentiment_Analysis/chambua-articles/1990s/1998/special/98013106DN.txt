{"text": "Let's conserve our\nwetlands better\nWorld Wetlands Day, to be observed on February 2, commemorates\na planetary theme that is much less well-known\nthan, say, World Aids Day, but whose statistics' are perhaps\neven more grim than those for HIV infection and certainly\nhave a much more long-term effect. Wetlands are crucial\nstores of freshwater. Wetlands Day is the 27th anniversary of\n.the signing in the Iranian city of Ramsar of the Convention on\nWetlands. Some 105 (including Kenya in 1990) have ratified\nthe Ramsar Convention.\nIt is appropriate to ponder the issues of Wetlands Day a little\nahead of the event. One of the most chilling of statistics to\ndo with the sustenance of human life, indeed of all life, on the\nplanet is the fact that only three per cent of the earth's water is\nfreshwater. According to the director of the Kenya Wildlife\nService, 97 per cent of our world's water is salty.\nOn the planetary scale, the amount of freshwater is constant,\nthe fact that it is in permanent flux and transformation\nnotwithstanding, but wetlands are being lost irretrievably all\nover the world. On the individual/regional scale over much of\nthe planet, water is scarce in many life-threatening ways.\nThe KWS points out in a Press statement this week: \"Water\nis critically scarce in many places and in Kenya the demand\nfor fresh water far exceeds supply ... Water is a shared\nresource, 40 per cent of the world's population live in the\nmore than 200 -river basins that are shared by two or more\n[countries]. A case in point is Lake Victoria, which is shared\n~three East African countries but supplies water to Sudan\n- and Egypt through River Nile. Thus managing water with a\nsound whole-basin approach requires a strong dose of political\nwill to co-operate for the common good. Otherwise water,\nthe source of life, could easily become the source of deadly\nconfrontations.\" .\nAnother grim statistic: A billion people lack an adequate\nsupply of water and 1.7 billion have no proper sanitation. That\nis more than half the world's population. As Dr David Western\npoints out, wetlands were the true cradle of civilisation, _\nfrom Mesopotamia and Egypt to the valleys of the Niger, Indus\nand Mekong rivers. They are also the future of the race.\n~Let us conserve and manage the world's wetlanns the better to preserve life."}
