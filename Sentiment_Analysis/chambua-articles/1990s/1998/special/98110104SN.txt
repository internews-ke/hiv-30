{"text": "Fresh row erupts over\nSouth Africa Aids drug\nBy CHRIS ERASMUS.\nNATION Correspondent.\nCAPE TOWN. Monday\nA fresh row has erupted over the so called Aids \"wonder drug\" developed by South African scientists with a request for an investigation into whether the ruling\nAfrican National Congress has a financial interest in the development of the drug.\nThe drug, Virodene PO58, came into the limelight early last year when Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma circumvented the usual medical testing procedures and arranged for its three Pretoria University\ndiscoverers to make a presentation to President Nelson\nMandela and the rest of his Cabinet.\nThe scientist told the Cabinet meeting that initial trials on patients and laboratory trials on infected human cells showed dramatic reductions in the virus in blood and other tissues.\nHowever, the drug was banned by the South African Medicines Control Council (MCC) which argued\nthat the developers had failed to follow ethical testing\nprocedures and that it had no proven effect on HIV in people.\nBut now the opposition Democratic Party has asked public protector Selby Biwa, to investigate\nwhether the ANC has a financial interest in the development of Virodene.\nIt said documents in its possession indicate that the ANC was promised a six per cent stake in the company developing the drug."}
