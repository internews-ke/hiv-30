{"text": "Churches join hands against major killer\nBy EVANS OMBIRO\nWhat is the church saying and doing about the Aids pandemic that is devastating people's lives? \nHas this centuries-old institution responded adequately and appropriately to this relatively crisis?\nThe problem of HIV/Aids has not spared the church, just like it has not stopped wrecking havoc in other institutions. However, church leaders in Kenya have been wrongly portrayed as being indifferent to the Aids crisis and even hostile toward persons with the disease.\nThe Church ministers to the largest population in Kenya. Out of the country's 30 million people, 80 per cent profess to be Christians. They divide themselves into hundreds of sects with the leading denominations being Catholic and Protestant churches.\nMedical Assistance Programme International, a Christian global health organization that provides services and materials to missions and churches in various parts of the world looks at the situation differently.\nSays the organisation in its latest publication on Aids: \"Church leaders do want to be involved in\nAids work, but not in the way most people were speaking about it. They want freedom to promote\nAids prevention in ways consistent with their' beliefs and systems. \nMAP carried out a 'project aimed at reducing high risk sexual behaviour among the church-going\npopulation in Kenya. The highlights of the project are contained in the book, Aids in Kenya, to be launched next Tuesday, by Catholic Archbishop\nNdingi mwana a Nzeki. The booklet chronicles the church's challenge and the lessons learned from the project. It summarises more than two years' activities by church leaders in Kenya who believed it was their challenge to prevent Aids, In involving itself in Aids, MAP 'responded to a challenge.\nTrends and figures on Aids\nprompted the organisation to join\nin the war against Aids. The agency\nworks to build the capacity of\nchurches in Kenya and the East\nand Southern Africa region, to respond\nappropriately to the HIV/Aids pandemic. It is non-denominational.\nAccording to its director, Dr\nPeter Okaalet the organisation\nmaintains a neutral stand on controversial\nissues, for instance the\ncondom, and leaves churches to\ntackle the issues their way. This\nexplains how MAP managed to\nbring together more than 10 denominations\nto deal with a common\nproblem.\nThe countries covered by MAP\nin Eastern and Southern Africa are\nKenya, Rwanda, Zaire, Angola\nand Tanzania. The regional office\nwas set up in Kenya in 1985.\nMAP has succeeded in \"bringing\nunity out of vast diversity,\" a\nsituation that \"demanded not only\na common cause, but a common statement of purpose.\"\nEducation, training and\nnetworking to meet long term\nhealth needs in Africa and to respond\nto emergency relief also fall\nwithin MAP's mission. In the early\nyears of Aids, church leaders\ndid not think that they needed to\nstruggle with the problem. Some\nthought that Aids was God's punishment upon sinners, and the\nchurch shouldn't get involved.\nMr Wilfred Amalemba, MAP\ntraining facilitator notes that there\nhas been a change of attitudes after\nthe project work: \"Aids is now\nnot viewed as' a punishment or\ncurse from God. Church leaders!\nmembers used to think Aids was\njudgment against promiscuity.\"\nThe Church's slow reaction to\nthe scourge is linked to this. \"Nobody\nwanted to stand on God's\nway.\" MAP has published a number\nof publications that help\npeople to make the best of their\nlife. Most of the publications are\ncounseling material, that underscore\nthe need to give people information\non healthy living.\n\"The church is the only place\nwhere you can reach so many\npeople at once, so many times. It\naddresses many people for 52\nweeks more than many organisations\nfighting Aids,\" said Mr\nSirima Githinji, MAP's .communications\nmanager.\nA 1994 consultation on Aids\nand the church held in Uganda\ndrew 150 participants from 28\ncountries across the continent.\nParticipants reached a declaration\nthat: \" ... As an epidemic of huge\nmagnitude, we recognise that\nAids is the opposite of life ...We\nappeal to the people of God, the\nchurch, to reengage in the battle\nfor life ...\" It was agreed that the\nchurch must speak out  and act\n- on preserving life against the\nkiller. Aids impacts on entire families;\nnot just the infected individuals.\nThe church challenged itself to\n\"save lives and prevent the devastation\nof Aids to families and\nmarriages. ' \"\n- The publication Aids in\nKenya reports that, \"When\nchurch teamed facts about the\nproblem of Aids in the church in\nKenya, they ,were shocked to\nknow of the magnitude within\nchurch walls. They wanted to do\nsomething about it.\nArchbishop Ndingi is among\nthe extremely influential church\nleaders who encouraged others to\nwage war against the disease targetting\nopinion leaders to influence\nbehaviour change as these\npeople can start a ripple effect on\nthe grass roots.\n\"Church leaders are respected\ncommunity leaders and help form\nthe character and behaviour of our\ncommunities.' ,\nLuo bishops of the Organisation\nof African Instituted\nChurches who in 1996 met to confront\nthe scourge noted that deep rooted\ncultures and traditions in the community helped propagate \nAids.\nThey said in a joint statement:\n\"We recognise that HIV/Aids is\ndestroying our families and\nthreatens the very survival of our\nfamilies, future generations, and\nour society. We recognise that\nsome of our traditions contribute\nto the spread of HIV/Aids ... \"\nThe bishops affirmed that the\nscourge was neither a curse nor\nwitchcraft, but a disease that was\nprimarily spread through sexual\ncontact.\nThey pinpointed sexual cleansing\nand wife inheritance that\nneeded 'modificcation if lives\nwere to be saved. They recommended\nthat church leaders must\nstrongly teach that HIV/Aids is\ncaused by a virus and is not a\ncurse or witchcraft\nMAP contends that the full impact\nof Aids is yet to be felt as the\none million people with HIV in\nKenya succumb to Aids and one\nmillion children are left orphaned.\n\"In addition, the human toll\nwill rob elderly couples of their\nsecurity of care in old age by their\nchildren, industry of skilled\nlabour and clans, government, and\nchurches of leadership. Even today,\nentire villages in parts of\nAfrica are home to only sexually\ninactive children,\" say the new\nbook. The book terms Aids as\n\"the biggest destroyer of families\nand youth in Africa today\" and\nnotes that, as a consequence,\nchurches are now talking about\nAids in the pulpit.\n\nKey to society's survival\nCultural values are essential for the survival of the society. In the case of marriage, the importance of cultural values and backgrounds of the marrying spouses is in the role they play in determining such matters as moral values, attitudes to sexuality, prevention of pregnancy and any other aspects of their sexual and marriage lives. Many of these values are universal human and can easily be learnt. This is well proved by the success of many inter-racial marriages.\nIn marriage, one of the requirements for adaptability between the spouses is mutual understanding of each other's cultural values. Today, Aids makes the process of spouse adaptability even more crucial than before.\nOur aids against Aids are in preparing the marrying spouses for complete adaptability to one another.\nIt is nevertheless vital to remember that if marrying couples come from different cultures, their values need to be harmomised to avoid the possibility of conflict occurring. The question of how to make the different values, attitudes and opinions of the spouses complementary is a most important one.\nIt is necessary to ensure that their values are as much in harmony as possible before marriage. If this is not done, their differences will inevitably bring conflict later in their marriage.\nSimilarity in cultural values is thus of importance in enhancing marriage satisfaction. To achieve this, there is need to enable courtship mates to meet in order to discover each other's values.\nThis is particularly true of marriage between partners who come from different ethnic groups, races or religions. Education does help to reduce and even eliminate such conflicts. In preparing for marriage, it is however essential to emphasize that all human beings are mostly the same.\nTheir differences in culture are purely related to how they have adapted to various environments.\nThese cultural backgrounds will also determine any differences in the sexual behaviour of the spouses.\nThe importance of religion lies firstly in the observation that the majority of marriages are legalized in religious ceremonies.\nMost of the young person will be members of a particular religion through which they have particular guidance in selecting mates.\nFor example, in some religions, marriage to members of other religions is discouraged or not allowed.\nThe majority of members are married to people of the same religion as their own. This is attained by marrying within one's own denomination or by conversions at the time of marriage.\nHowever, some religions are more adaptable than others in this regard and they do facilitate religious harmony in the family. This is essential because religious differences between husband and wife can be a handicap to the marriage relationship and very confusing for the children of the marriage.\nIn practice, it is simpler and more convenient if everyone in the family holds the same religious belief.\nSecondly, religious beliefs are important in determining the values and practices upheld by the spouses. For example, the question of birth control between spouses of different religions can cause problems. Difference in religions of spouses may also make adjustment difficult in the raising of children. Serious conflicts occur between materially oriented spouses."}
