This includes clinical and nursing care, counselling and social support from the hospital to the home. The doctor is a vital link in this continuum.\nEffective' counselling; for example, leads to a strong doctor-patient relationship, and makes all the difference in how patients accept their situation and approach sexual and other relationships.\nFurthermore, few patients can afford expensive antiretroviral drugs, yet many opportunistic infections can be treated adequately with affordable standard drugs and thus prolong life. In addition,\nAids control requires positive health promotion, and a. knowledge of medico-legal and social issues.\nAll these factors and more are important in good Aids and STI management, and form the bases for this unique Postgraduate Diploma now being offered to doctors for the first time in Africa.\n This is, therefore, a course for you.\u2028 \nPostgraduate Diploma in, the Control and Management of Sexually\nTransmitted Infections by Distance Learning, University of\nNairobi, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Medical Microbiology and Faculty' of External Studies, Department of Educational Studies.\n\n The diploma will give learners the specialised knowledge and skills required to handle the increasing number of patients with\nSTI, including HIV/Aids.\nWith this post-graduate diploma, you will: \nGain up-to-date knowledge and skills in an area of growing public health importance; specialise in STI and HIV/ Aids management and control; study at a place of your choice, time and pace within two years; o Use your newly-acquired skills to help patients with special problems even as you go through the course.\n\nYou gain all this without having to leave your patients, practice or family for lengthy periods.\nThis postgraduate specialization can help further your medical career, or prepare you for a change in career direction.\n\nMode of study\nThe syllabus for the postgraduate diploma will be covered in four semesters over a period of 24 months.\nThe course consists of the following:\n\nIndependent study at home with specially-designed course materials (print and audio-visual); o Face-to-face sessions with tutors which include lectures, tutorials and practicals;\nExamination at the end of each year comprising written, oral and practical exercises.\nIn addition, there will be an induction seminar which will introduce students to the course material\nand familiarise them with the\nbest methods of independent study at home.\n\nFor effective Aids control, the doctors will need to enhance their knowledge of counselling, health promotion, and medico-legal and social issues, alongside their clinical skills.
