The wholesale cost\nOf the drugs alone runs about $800\nper pregnancy - clearly far beyond\nthe means of people living in\ncountries in which the annual\nhealth-care budget is often less\nthan $10 per person.\nTo try to find a cheaper treatment,\nresearchers have set up trials\nin developing nations to test\nsimpler, shorter regimes. Several\nof these have been what are called\nplacebo-controlled trials. In these\ntrials, one group of subjects,\ncalled. the treatment group, receive\nthe active treatment, while a\nsecond group, called the controlled\ngroup, is given an inactive\nplacebo. Usually, these trials are\n\"double-blinded\" meaning that\nneither the subjects nor the researchers\nknow who is getting the\nactive drug and who the placebo.\nThe idea is that if everyone is\nblinded, it is less likely that one's\nexpectations about the treatment\nwill influence the assessment of\nthe drug's effects.\nThe design of these trials, however,\nhave recently come under\nattack by critics in North America\nand Europe who charge they are\nunethical. They argue that under\ninternationally accepted rules of\nbioethics, the only justifiable reason\nfor conducting a placebo-controlled\ntrial is when you do not\nknow for certain if the treatment is\nno better than a placebo.\nFor example, if it has been established\nthat a particular antibiotic\nis an effective treatment for\npneumonia, it would be unethical\nto conduct another trial in which\nyou compared that antibiotic with\na placebo. Researchers conducting\nsuch a trial would knowingly\nbe putting the people in the con-\nNortrol\ngroup in danger.\nThis would violate one of the\nfundamental principles of research\nbioethics: Beneficence,\nthat is, that a study must be designed\nso that the risk to people\nparticipating in research be minimised,\nwhile the potential benefit\nis maximised.\nIt is considered ethical, however,\nto conduct a trial to compare a\nproven treatment with an unproven treatment, if you have good\u00b7\nreason to believe the new treatment\nis as good as or better than\nthe proven treatment - either, for\nexample, because it is more effective,\nless toxic or is easier and\ncheaper to administer.\nUnder these precepts, then, to\nbe ethical, in any trial involving a\nnew treatment the people in the\ncontrol group must receive the\nproven treatment or what is called\n\"the best available treatment\" for\ncomparison.\"\nAny trial testing cheaper, simpler\nregiments to prevent motherto-\nchild HIV infection; the critics\nargue, must have the control\ngroup receive the proven intensive\nregimen being used in North\nAmerica and Europe, while the\nwomen in the treatment group\nwould receive a less intensive, but\npromising, alternate regimen.\nBut in an essay in a recent issue\nof The Lancet, researchers working\nin the West African nation of\nGambia respond to those criticisms\narguing that the health\nproblems facing people living in .\nthe impoverished developing\nnations are so different from those\nin the developed world that different\nbioethical standards are justified,\nand they denounce efforts to\nimpose bioethical rules developed\nin rich nations on poor developing\ncountries, calling them \"prejudiced, intolerant and even unethical.\"\nThey fear that such criticism\nwill cause international aid agencies\nto cut funds for these and\nother research projects and imperii\nefforts to improve health care in\nAfrica. \"Ethics cannot be owned\nby affluent countries alone,\" they\nwrite.\nThe essay was written by the\nGambia Government/Medical\nResearch Council Joint Ethical\nCommittee which oversees medical\nresearch in The Republic of\nGambia, a tiny nation of just over\n4,369 square miles on Africa's\nAtlantic coast with a population of\nabout 1.2 million people and a per\ncapita income of only $1,100.\nCommittee members say that\nwhat is the \u2022'best available treatment\"\nin an affluent developed\nnation is often irrelevant to people\nliving in developing nations because\nthey are just far too expensive\nand often require highly sophisticated\nhealth systems to\nadminister. They point out that a\nthree-drug anti-viral regimen,\nwhich includes expensive new\n.protease-inhibitor drugs, is now\nconsidered the standard' therapy\nfor HIV-infection in affluent\nnations.\n\u2022'These drugs cannot be afforded in Africa,\" they write, \"and\nthe logistics of treatment and\nmonitoring of side effects is beyond\nthe dreams of even the most\nidealistic.' ,\nBecause there is little money\nfor health care in these countries,\nthe choice health-care providers\nface is often between doing something\nthat is very cheap - or\nnothing at all.\nIn this situation, the purpose of\na study is not determined if the\nsimpler, cheaper regimen is as\nwhether it is better than \"current\nstandard local therapy, even if that\nstandard is nothing,\" the committee\nmembers write. When that is\nthe case, a placebo control is necessary,\nthey argue .\nEven when money is not the\nproblem, placebo-controlled trials\nof \"proven\" treatments may still\nbe necessary before they are\nadopted in a developing nation, .\nthey write.\nA treatment that is found to be\neffective in a developed nation,\nwhere, for example, people may\ngenerally be in better health and\nhave better nutrition, may not\nwork as well in a poor, underdeveloped\nnation, where people may\nhave a different genetic make up,\ndifferent medical problems and\npoorer nutrition ..\nFor this reason, even when\nevaluating relatively cheap treatments,\nsuch as vaccines, researchers\nin developing nations sometimes\nhave to repeat placebocontrolled\ntrials done in a\ndeveloped nation to see if the\n\"best available treatment\" in\nNorth America or Europe actually\nworks in poor nations. o Meanwhile, the supervisor of\nSexually Transmitted Diseases/\nAIDS programme in Nakuru\nDistrict has said that a recent survey\ncarried out by the World\nhealth Organisation shows that 90\nper cent of all the HIV positive infants\nare born in Africa, 37 per\ncent of them in East and Central\nAfrica, adds Nixon Wainaina .\nMr Njoroge told the participants\nthat while HIV cases in the\ndeveloped world have been on a\nsteady decline available data\nshows that the disease is spreading\nvery fast in Africa especially\nin war torn countries.\nIn Sub Saharan Africa the official\nsaid, 13.3 million infections\nwere adults/adolescents aged between\n15-24 while three million\ninfants were HIV positive ..\nThe official blamed African\ngovernments for withholding information\non HIV cases saying\nthat statistics should be made\navailable to the people for the reality\nto sink in.\n\nInterest in the\nopposite sex\nWith the coming of adolescenc~,\ninterest in a person' of the opposite\nsex becomes an important way of\nexpressing feelings of affection.\nFurthermore, adolescents naturally\noccupy much of their time\nimagining what their sexual\nchanges will lead them to. '\nIn boys this imagining leads to\nwet dreams. If the consciences of\nthe young persons guide them to\nkeep such imaginary wishes witl!-\nin what is possible or what is socially\napproved, th~y find them to\nbe a source of creative life ..\nHowever, if they are unrealistic\nand go beyond what is possible or\nwhat is culturally approved, such\nimaginary wishes can become ,a\nsource of serious frustration and\nproblems.\nOur aids against Aids are in\ndeveloping the consciences of\nchildren so that they can be\u00b7\ncome adolescents creatively.\nFeelings of affection towards'a\nloved member of the opposite sex\nare easily aroused by looking at,\nhearing or thinking about the\nloved person or by looking at photographs\nand other items belonging\nto the loved person.\nIn some cases however, there is\nexcessive inclination towards the\nphysical aspects of sexual activity\nwhich is largely due to lack of appreciation\nand commitment tegarding\nmarriage and human family\nrelationships based on love. ;:\nBoys are much more quickily\naroused sexually than girls. ~ut\nthen boys are also much more\nquickly and easily put off from\ntheir sexual arousal by the slightest\ndisturbances or by surroundings\nin which they feel uncertain.\nFurthermore, boys are culturally\nmade to understand that they\nare the ones to take the initiative\nin sexual relations.\nYoung people today are Qot\nnecessarily more inclined towards\nsexual activity than those of past\ngenerations. The natural attractiveness\nbetween male and femiIle\nat adolescent did occur in the p~st\nas it does today ..\nHowever, there is some difference\nin approach to sexuality between\nyoung persons today and in\nthe past. Today the approach' is\nmore directly and is controlled by\nthe young persons themselves. '.\nIn the past, courtship has often\nbeen arranged by parents and relatives\naccording to traditional, or\nreligious practices of the time.\nAdolescent sexuality: Most: of\nthe biological make up of hUlT!an\nbeings is the same because they\nbelong to the same species. This\nmeans that the biological characteristics\nof adolescents of gro\\}'th\nin height and strength accompanied\nby sexual maturation are universal\nbecause they are human\ncharacteristics and therefore common\nto all human beings.\nHowever, the cultural practices\nunder which the adolescents grow\nup vary from generation to generation\nand from community to\ncommunity. It is the differences in\nthese cultural practices which are\nresponsible for variations and\nuniqueness in sexual behaviour\namong adolescents and adults.\nMoral teaching during upbringing\nregarding sexuality is of particular\nimportance. In most communities,\npractically every aspect\nof sexual behaviour is dealt with\none way or another according to\nbeliefs of the community and the\nextent of influence of modern\nknowledge.\nFor example, the differences\nbetween western society and African\ntraditional beliefs and practices\non sexuality will be found in\nmatters such as the incidence and\neffectiveness of treatment of sexually\ntransmitted diseases; trends\nof pregnancies before marriage;\nthe proportions of unmarried to\nmarried mothers and the kind of\nhelp they get; and in the legal status\nof abortion to get rid of unwanted\npregnancies.\nA most important difference is\nthe contribution the poor unmarried\nmothers make to family and\npopulation development. For example,\nin some developed countries,\none quarter to one third of\nbrides are pregnant at the time of\nmarriage.\nIn some developing countries\nbetween 30-60 per cent of all\nbirths are by unmarried mothers.\nThe breakdown of traditional social\ncontrols there has led to an increasing\nrate of pregnant brides\nand an increasing problem of un- .\u2022\nmarried adolescent mothers.\nThis has important implications ;JII\nregarding the kind of care that\nthese children get without fathers.\nFurthermore, it has important implications\nregarding the kind of\nfamily life that the children will in\nturn have when they grow up.\nThe couples who begin having\nchildren so early in marriage are\nlikely to go on having them for\nmost of their child-bearing age of\nthe woman.\nOur aids against Aids are in\nensuring that girls get adequate\nand functional education so that they can take\nproper care of their families . \u2022\u2022\u2022 o An Aids Education\nProgramme, P.O.
