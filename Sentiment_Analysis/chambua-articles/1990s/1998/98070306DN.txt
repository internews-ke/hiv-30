{"text": "UN Aids agency\non right track\nAs researchers continue to search for a cure to one of this century's\nmost dreaded diseases, it is encouraging to learn that\nscientists have stepped up efforts to meet the challenge. More\nheartening though is the announcement of a new research and\n. initiatives to slow the spread of the scourge and improve treatment\nwhere it is needed most - in the developing world.\nThis is the region that has been most devastated by Aids.\nStatistics indicate that nearly 90 per cent of all Aids and HIV\ncases are found in the developing world. Narrowed down further\nsub-Saharan Africa has recorded the highest number of\nAid~ cases, with II million people estimated to be infected. In\nour own country, more than 200,000 people have developed\nAids since the disease was first diagnosed.\nAs part of its concerted effort to curb the epidemic, the\nUnited Nations Aids agency, UNAIDS, has revealed plans to\nhelp stop HIV positive women in 11 of the worlds poorest\ncountries from passing the virus on to their babies. The agency\nsays mother-to-child transmission is the most common\nway of transmitting the virus in the developing world ..\nRevealing' its plans at the 12th World Aids Conference m\nGeneva, UNAIDS said its project was targeted at around\n30,000 women, who will receive antenatal care, counselling\nand improved medical assistance during labour and birth.\nThe agency says that in poor countries, 25 - 30 per cent of\nwomen with the virus pass it on to their babies at, birth or\nthrough breastfeeding, compared to just five per cent in the\nindustrialised world.\nWhile the development of a cost-effective and efficient\nvaccine is widely thought to be a long way off, representatives\nof drug companies at the Geneva conference have announced progress in finding new ways to suppress the Virus the blood.\nAs it is the UN is determined to bring the spread of Aids\nunder control. However for these plans to bear fruit, it will be\nnecessary for national governments to project the. correct picture\nof the Aids situation within their borders. Similarly, the\ngovernments, especially those in the developing countries,\nmust seize the offer from UNAIDS to help the most vulnerable\nmembers of their societies - women and children."}
