{"text": "Pre-marital sex a grave risk\nChanging attitudes and values, early sexual\nmaturity and late marriages are redefining the\nproblems associated with adolescent sexuality\u00b7\n. in developing countries. Early marriages and\nchildbearing among married teens are still\ncommon in some areas. Pre-marital sexual activity\namong adolescents has become a serious\nproblem.\nResearchers have found high rates of sexuality\namong unmarried teenagers in a number\nof developing countries. Pre-marital sex exposes\nyoung people to the risk of sexually\ntransmitted infections, including Aids.\nFor girls, sexual activity poses the additional\nrisk of pregnancy before they are physically\nmature. Early or unwanted pregnancies often\nhave adverse social, economic and psychological\nconsequences.\nHelping adolescents protect themselves\nagainst the risks posed by early pre-marital sex\nis a difficult challenge facing our society today.\nThe best protection against unwanted\npregnancies and other ills brought about by sex\nis abstinence.\nHowever, adolescents, faced by all kinds of\nsocial changes, find that traditional social restraints\nagainst pre-marital sex no longer seem\nstrong enough to keep them off sex.\nGirls today reach sexual maturity at a younger\nage, probably because of improved nutrition\nand faster accumulation of body fat. The\naverage age when regular menstruation begins, has dropped by one to two years in the\npast 50 .years. In most countries, girls now\nreach menarche between the age of 12 and 14.\nData on sexual activity among teenagers are\nlimited, but surveys and reports show that the .\nnumber of sexually active adolescents is increasing, particularly in urban areas.\nOne of the most serious health hazards associated\nwith sexual activity among adolescents\ntoday is the risk of HIV infection and Aids .\nUnwanted pregnancies among adolescents in\nthe developing world are often ended by dangerous\nillegal abortions.\nComplications of illegal abortions are some\nof the leading causes of maternal deaths in developing\ncountries. Women treated for abortion\ncomplications are 19 years old or younger.\nMost adolescents who had had abortions said\nthey did so to stay in school.\nPregnancy is a health hazard to single and\nmarried women younger than 18. They are\nmore likely to experience complications and to\ndie during pregnancy and childbirth than are\nwomen in their 20s.\nCommon complications among adolescents\ninclude obstructed labour, pregnancy-induced\nhigh blood pressure and iron deficiency anaemia.\nThese are the leading causes of death\namong young women in a number of countries.\nThe risk of obstetrical complications and\nmaternal and infant mortality is greater among\nyounger mothers, particularly those below 16.\nAdolescents are still growing and are not\nphysically prepared for childbearing. Cephalopelvic\ndisproportion, which occurs when the\ninfant's head is too large to pass easily through\nthe mother's pelvis, is common among adolescents.\nThe children of teenage mothers are also at\nrisk. In some countries, infant mortality rates\nare 50 per cent higher among children of mothers younger than 20, than those of mothers in\ntheir 20s.\nChildren of teenage mothers are also likely to be of a low birth weight and to experience\ndevelopment and learning problems later in\nlife.\nEven when these complications do not occur\nand the teenager delivers a healthy baby,\nshe rarely has the opportunity to give her child\nthe necessary emotional and economic support.\nSingle motherhood is considered a disgrace\nin many societies and may even lead to\ninfanticide. Whether married or single, urban\nor rural women who had their first child before\n17 are usually poorer and less educated than\nthose who start childbearing in their 20s.\nPostponing early sexual activity among adolescents\navoids harmful consequences. Counselling\nand educational efforts often focus on\nhelping adolescents understand the consequences\nof early sexual activity.\nParents must be encouraged to talk to their\nchildren about sex, while schools should also\nprovide sex education. Family life education\nwould have been the best for our children\nwhile at school, but because many people\ndon't understand what it is, the Ministry of\nEducation does not allow it in schools.\nOnly a minority of adolescents receive comprehensive\neducation about reproduction and\ncontraceptives. Many parents, clergy and\nteachers believe that sex education will encourage\npromiscuity among adolescents.'\nHowever, studies show that sex education (or\nfamily life education) does not encourage early\nsexual activity.\nBut it is immoral and unethical to give\nschoolgirls contraceptives. Counselling youth\nshould be a collective responsibility of society.\n. Isaac Oluoko Buoga.\nOvani. Nyanza."}
