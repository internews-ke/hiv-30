{"text": "December 6, 1998\n\nPREVENTION IS BETTER THAN CURE.\u2028\nAids is acquired which means that Many times,\u2028\npeople go looking for it by engaging in activities\u2028\nthat expose them to the virus. Aids strikes like\u2028\nlightning, spreads like bush fire and kills like\u2028\nvenom, so watch out\u2028\n\u2014 But prevention is better than cure. Everyone should exercise discipline, respect and care. Eunice\u2028\nSheila Khomola, Kisumu. \u2028\nSOMETIMES EXPERIENCE\u2028\nIS, NOT THE BEST TEACHER\n\nAlthough your life is very precious to you, it belongs to\u2019 God. You depend on it but other people depend on it more than you do. You may lose your life naturally, accidentally or by committing suicide. Whenever this happens, your country, family, relatives and friends lose tremendously.\u2028\n\u2018The age affected most by the virus is between\u2028\n16 and 50 years which means that you could easily be one of them. \u2018I call upon Kenyans youth to return to God and seek salvation because the kingdom of God is at hand, Experience has shown that there is no joy\u2028\nin sex before or outside marriage. You only end up\u2028\nHeartbroken and more uncertain at best, but at\u2028\nworst, you end up dead and killing your family or\u2028\nfuture through Aids. The reality about Aids is so\u2028\nserious that it is no longer just, a question of\u2028\nabstaining from sex before marriage but getting\nmedically tested before any pair decides on a marriage. They say experience is the best teacher, and practice makes perfect but in the case of Aids, we\u2028\ncan\u2019t apply the above sayings because after you\u2028\nshall have died of Aids, there is nothing you are\u2028\ngoing to learn further through experience and\u2028\nafter practice, you are going to be perfect under\u2028\nthe grave. . . . . ,\u2028\nWHAT AN AIDS VICTIM FEELS\u2028\nDenial at first people cannot believe they\u2028\nhave Aids. They say \u201cthe doctor must be wrong\u201d.\u2028\nShock: No matter how much you prepare it\u2028\nis a shock to learn that you have HIV or Aids.\u2028\n\u2018 Anger Some people get very angry when\u2028\nthey find out that they have Aids - some may even\u2028\nblame God. \u2028\n, \u2022 Bargaining: Some people try to bargain. They\u2028\nthink \u201cGod. Will cure me if I stop having sex\u201d.\u2028\n. \u2022 Loneliness: they often feel lonely.\u2028\n. Fear: They fear many things like pain, losing\u2028\ntheir job, death, leaving their children, and even\u2028\nother people knowing that they are infected.\u2028\n.Self-consciousness: They think everyone: is\u2028\nlooking at them or talking about them, they feel\u2028\nrejected by other people they even feel guilty\u2028\n. Depression: People with Aids feel there is no good reason for living.\u2028\nEsther M.Karimi, 21 yrs, Maua.\n\nI LOST, MY FAMILY TO..\u2028\nI want to thank you for giving us the opportunity to air our views.\u2028\nI\u2019m twenty years old. I sat for my KCSE in\u2028\n1996 and I haven\u2019t done anything since then. I am\u2028\nan Aids victim because my parents and brother\u2028\ndied of Aids. My father died in 1995 and my mother in 1996\u2019and my brother in 1997.\u2028\nWhen all this happened I knew that it really\u2028\ndoes exist. We were left orphaned and our dreams\u2028\nwere shattered. My parents wanted me to go to\u2028\nthe USA for further studies but that won\u2019t happen\u2028\nnow My mother was my hero. She is the late Mrs\u2028\nT M Agengo and, was a former member of the\u2028\nTAPWAK organisation. She prepared us for her\ndeath and 'made sure that we understood\u2028\nwhat was happening. She was a very strong woman who \u2028\nnever gave up. She loved us, her children very\u2028\nmuch, We have gone through a lot of pain. I being\u2028\nthe eldest now, in our family, have had to take care\u2028\nto the rest, bathe and feed them,\u2028\nIt is difficult, to say that our parents died from\u2028\nAids but we have no choice but to admit that Aids\u2028\nexists within our people, be it young or old.\u2028\nI want to encourage people both young and\u2028\nold to care for people with Aids. Make them feel\u2028\nloved and appreciated as this a(so contributes to,\u2028\ntheir life. Avoid blood transfusion, extra and pre\u2028\nmarital sex. .\u2028\nAs for the \u2018theme \u201cForce for. change,\u201d I think\u2028\nwe are all being forced to change our attitude\u2028\ntowards this disease. It doesn\u2019t choose, it attacks\u2028\nanyone whether rich or poor. \n\nTHE \u2018GOVERNMENT CAN  DO MORE\u2028\nVarious factors have led to rapid spread of\u2028\nAids like ignorance, idleness and lack of sex education. Government hospitals today are empty buildings\u201d lacking essential drugs and other facilities. These are places where the government expects the society, to get awareness about the\u2028\n, deadly disease. Sex education has been removed\u2028\nfrom school curriculums;\u2028\nThe government should do more to bring\u2028\nabout change in the society\u2019s attitude, by alerting\u2028\nthe masses about the deadly .disease and how it\u2028\nhas spread.\u2028\nNelson Ndutive Gcwndu.\u2028\nGIVE US THE TRUE PICTURE\u2028\nThe best way to fight out Aids is by showing\u2028\nthe world the true facts of Aids and the fate that\u2028\ngoes with it. Aids information should go beyond\u2028\nprevention methods and should even include pictures \n\nof Aids victims. - \u201a \u2018\u2028\nThere is need for proper communication as\u2028\nan essential element in the control arid prevention\u2028\nof this deadly disease. The government, international, bodies, and NGOs should be aware how much can be achieved by the selection of appropriate coimnunicarion. If we are a serious lot let us fully utilise the available resources to the best of our advantage and help create public awareness.\u2028\nGeorge Much ma, 17 yrs # 11I3, Nyeri. "}
