Dr Obwaka was presenting a paper,\n. during a workshop at Nairobi's Pan Afric\nHotel on Friday.\nStudies show that the ratio of people infected by the HIV virus worldwide was\ntwo women to every man.\nThe biological and physiological attributes\nof women, Dr Obwaka added.'\nmake them more vulnerable than men.\n\"Unlike men, women are unable (and\ntake a longer time) to detect a disease:\nsuch as gonorrhoea.:' .\nRisky-practices such female circumcision also contribute to the transmission\nof the scourge because most traditional\n\"surgeons\" don't sterilise, the instruments they use. _\n\"Cultural norms which do not allow\nwomen to have a say on sexual matters,\nthe refusal to give women property inheritance rights, ,armed conflicts' that displace\npeople, income dependency on\nmen, lack of access to education and discriminative\nemployment policies that do '\nnot 'allow, families to stay together are\nalso some, of the factors that make women\nmore vulnerable to the killer disease.\"\nIn order to' assist women overcome these barriers, Dr Obwaka suggested, the\ngovernment and other stakeholders\n,should emphasise on early diagnosis of\nSTDs among women and integrate the\nsame in the Maternal and Child Health,\nand Family planning clinics.\n, Other, interventions that should be considered,\nshe added, include introducing\nfamily life education in schools, enabling\nwomen to protect themselves by empowering them through education and access\nto credit and encouraging men to be '\u00b7involved in family planning and reproductive\nhealth programmes.\nWhile officially dosing the workshop,\nthe managing director of Nation Newspapers Ltd, Mr Joe Adongo, praised journalists for their role in educating society on\n, the danger posed by the scourge.\n\"The ramifications of HIV/Aids to the\ncountry's  socio-economic set-up is, to\n. say the least, immense. Journalists must\n: ensure this issue. is not kept out of the\npublic eye.\"\nMr Adongo said the media organisation\nwas ready to collaborate with other\n.stakeholders in awarding journalists who\nexcel in reporting on Aids.
