{"text": "It's a tough test for\nRwanda UN tribunal\nARUSHA. Monday\nIf anything sums up the good intentions\nof the international tribunal established to try the chief suspects of Rwanda's 1994 genocide\nit is the oft-quoted dictum of Britain's.\nLord Hewart: \"Justice\nshould not only be done,\" he\nwrote in 1924, \"but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to\nbe done. \"\nSetin a: wing of a conference\ncentre in Arusha, northern Tanzania,\nthe International Criminal\nTribunal for Rwanda is doggedly\npursuing visible justice for more\nthan 500,000 victims of one of the\ncentury's worst mass crimes.\nThe victims were minority Tutsis\nand moderates from the Hutu\nmajority: The killers were overwhelmingly\nHutus whipped up by\npolitical and ethnic extremists\nwho feared a takeover by Tutsi\nrebels.\nThe United Nations court is\ntreading a delicate balance between\ntrying those accused of organising\nor inciting the genocide\nand ensuring they are dealt with\njustly.\nArusha appears ill-equipped to\nhouse the tribunal. The court\nneeds hundreds of staff to function.\nTranslators, jurists, recorders,\nsecurity personnel, administrators\n- not to mention judges,\nprosecutors and defence lawyers.\nGiven that the national language\nof Rwanda is Kinyarwanda\n- although French was widely\nunderstood by the educated classes\n- and that Tanzanians speak\nchiefly KiswahiJi and some English,\nArusha was never going to\nbe a fertile source for staff.\nAnd those staff, many drawing\nsalaries hundreds of times greater\nthan Tanzania's average wage,\nmust be housed to United Nations\nstandards in a town that can\nscarcely provide enough shelter\nfor its own people.\n\"The tribunal has been a mixed\nblessing for Arusha,\" said Mr\nDonald Mpondo of the city's\nchamber of commerce.\n\"On the one hand it has created\nsome employment opportunities\nbut these are mainly menial jobs\nsuch as cleaners or drivers.\n\" Also they have driven up\nprices. It is impossible for even a\nwell off businessman to afford to rent a house in town. All the good property has gone to the United Nations.'\"\nIn 1996 the tribunal was subject to one of the most scathing internal audits in the UN's history. Slamming it for waste and inefficiency, Secretary-General Kofi Annan sacked a number of senior administrators and put a new team in place headed by Mr Agwu Ukiwe Okali as registrar with a budget of $59 million for 1998.\n\"I am proud to say we have improved things,\" Mr Okali, a Nigerian, told a news conference last month. \"We are working under very difficult conditions but we just so happen to be located in Arusha and that is that.\"\nNot exactly. Arusha was chosen as headquarters of the tribunal in November 1994 for political and geographical reasons. The Tanzanians themselves lobbied hard for it.\nAs a neighbour of Rwanda, Tanzania hosted peace talks between Kigali's Hutu government of the late President Juvenal Habyrimana and the exiled Tutsi opposition before the genocide.\nWhen the UN debated where to establish the tribunal, Rwanda's capital Kigali was rejected as being too traumatised to allow the calm dispensation of justice.\nNairobi, the obvious choice, was ruled out because of the Tutsi be lief that Kenya was pro-Hutu.\nTanzania swiftly volunteered Arusha, with one eye on finding a long-term use for the Chinese built\nwhite elephant of a conference centre.\nMr Okali spoke last month to\nmore than 30 international journalists\nwho came to hear the evidence\nof General Romeo Dellaire;\nthe former head of the UN's ill fated\npeacekeeping mission to\nRwanda.\nAlongside him sat Judge Laity\nKama, a tall, reed-thin Senegalese. As president of the tribunal,\nKama is responsible for pressing\nprosecutors into getting trials finished\nbefore the world forgets that\nthe genocide even took place.\nSo far the record is not great.\nThe court has 22 suspects in custody, of a total of 35 indicted so far - although officials say privately\nthey expect further indictments\nand transfers to the tribunal\nto take place soon.\nIn contrast,' more than 130,000\nsuspects are being held in grim\nconditions in Rwanda's jails.\nMore than 300 have already been -\ntried in Rwanda, with more than\n100 sentenced to death and 100 to\nlife imprisonment. No executions\nhave been carried out.\nThe tribunal has yet to complete\nits first trial and only four\nhave started.\nThose in Rwanda convicted of\n\"Category One\" crimes - actively\nparticipating in the genocide\nand pleading not guilty -\nface an automatic death sentence.\nThe maximum sentence the tribunal\ncan pass is life imprisonment\nin humane conditions, although\nfor some who may be\nconvicted that is unlikely to prove\na very long time.\nDefence lawyers told Reuters\nthat at least four of the accused\nhave tested positive for human\nimmunodeficiency virus (HIV)\nand one of them has already developed\nfull-blown Aids.\nThe tribunal is swift to defend\nitself against accusations of time wasting\nand inefficiency. \"You\nall think that the people we have\nin this court are automatically\nguilty of genocide,\" a senior official\ntold Reuters. \"What you must\nrealise is that we are being held up\nto the most intense scrutiny but it\nisn't a question of the right way or\nthe wrong way, it is a question of\njustice.\" (Reuters)\nIn court: Deo Bizimana, the first person to be tried in Rwanda for\ninvolvement in the massacre of 500,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus.\nDAVID FOX reports that set in a wing of a conference centre in\nArusha town in northern Tanzania, the International Criminal\nTribunal for Rwanda is doggedly pursuing visible justice for more\nthan 500,000Tutsi and moderate Hutu victims slain by Hutu soldiers\nand allied militia in one of the century's worst mass crimes"}
