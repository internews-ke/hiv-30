{"text": "Preventing transmission of HIV\nUnprotected anal intercourse has the highest risk to sexual transmission of HIV \u2013 and omitting this fact from education campaigns may actually increase the incidence of anal intercourse with men and women. Where understanding of Aids is poor, HIV can spread rapidly among groups of men who have sex with men and from them, less rapidly, to their female sexual partners and their future children.\nThis pattern of rapid transmission occurred in the late 1970s and early 1980s in North America and Western Europe and was seen later in several other countries.\nIn some regions, such as North America, sex between men continues to be the predominant mode of HIV transmission while in others, such as the English speaking Caribbean, it appears to have been overtaken by sexual transmission between men and women.\nIn Thailand, one paper suggest that 6 per cent of men have same sex experience, but same sex activity is responsible for 12 per cent of transmission of HIV infection in men.\nIn countries where sex between men is recognised, nongovernmental organisations and sometimes governments have developed prevention programmes which have often succeeded in limiting or reducing the rate at which HIV is transmitted between men.\nHowever, where sex between men is denied, such prevention programmes are seldom developed.\nIn the last ten years, small groups of men in a number of countries have formed organizations which attempt to address this problem, but these have often been limited by financial and cultural considerations. These cultural factors may include hostility or indifference from the government, laws against sex between men, disagreement between different ethnic or socioeconomic groups as to the goals of the campaign and hostility or indifference from the men they are trying to reach, who often deny that they are at risk.\nDespite these obstacles, many NGOs working with men who have sex with men have gained valuable experience both in understanding the social arid psychological factors behind such behaviour and in developing programmes which respond to these factors. The best of these programmes not only help men to protect themselves in their sexual encounters with other men, but also to protect their female partners and future children. Furthermore, by their actions and presence, they alert governments and, to some extent, the general population to the fact that men who have sex with men are an integral part of their society.\nAs revealed in a study undertaken by Panos in 1996, there are still many countries and cultures where there is little or no recognition of the existence or the extent of sexual activity between men and where government and non-governmental response has been non-existent or minimal.\nThis means that in many parts of the world, it is still not certain the extent to which sex between men is a significant factor in the Aids epidemic and assumptions of an exclusively or predominantly male female epidemic need to be re-examined.\nIn the English-speaking Caribbean, the health authorities are re-examining the role of sexual transmission between men, prompted by awareness that many men are reluctant to admit sexual activity with other men and by the high percentage of cases where transmission is reported as \"unknown\" - 18 per cent across the region and as high as 35 per cent in some countries.\nDr Bilali Camara points out that \"in countries where sex between men is accepted, we see that there are less cases of 'unknown'.\"\nThe implication is that many of these \"unknowns\" are in fact sex between men. A similar situation may be seen in Mexico, where the percentage of' 'unknowns\" reaches 40 per cent.\nThe debate as to whether these should be attributed to sex between men is much more than epidemiological, since it goes to the heart of how Mexicans perceive their own sexual behaviour.\nCamara suggests that social pressures on men who prefer men may be perpetuating the epidemic in the Caribbean.\n, \"If society is really pushing people to be married and does not tolerate homosexuality, we will be battling for a long time\"\nHe adds that only when society as whole accepts that some men prefer sex with men, will it be possible to \"empower people; to accept what they are and do the correct thing - that is practise protective behaviour. \" \nMuriel Douglas, acting co-ordinator of the National Aids Programme in Trinidad, recommends that education on HIV transmission between men be given to secondary school children of both sexes.\nWhile this might not increase tolerance, it would at least provide young men attracted to other men with the knowledge of how to protect themselves and would advise young women that their male partners may risk through sex with other men.\nHowever, Douglas admitted, this idea is still theoretical since funds are not available for such work.\n\nFrom time immemorial, men in most societies - past and present writes WANJIRA KIAMA have had sexual relationships with other men. It is not known why some men prefer to have sex with other males rather than with women. As a species, human males and females mate in order to reproduce, but the sexual behaviour of individuals is driven by a range of social, psychological and biological factors that are still poorly understood. Recent studies suggest that gene or the hypothalamus may influence a man's desire to have sex with other men.\n\nDisfiguring worries doctors\nWASHINGTON. Wednesday\nSome Aids patients are developing a bizarre syndrome of disfiguring fat deposits on parts of their bodies as their faces and limbs shrink to skin and bones - possibly side effects of life-saving drugs protease inhibitors.\nDoctors' reports to the government paint a stark picture: Three women looked like \"apples on a stick\" from the mound of stomach and breast fat above birdlike legs. Another patient developed a large hump on the nape of his neck. A woman jumped four sizes as her waist barreled and her legs shrank.\nThe Food and Drug Administration is worried that the fat deposits are more than a cosmetic problem: some patients also are developing risks for heart disease such as skyrocketing cholesterol. The\nFDA, Aids researchers and drug companies are scrambling for answers.\n\"We don't want to alarm people, because we think the benefits of protease inhibitors still outweigh the risks,\" said FDA medical officer Jeff Murray. But, he said, \"We're concerned.\"\n(AP)"}
