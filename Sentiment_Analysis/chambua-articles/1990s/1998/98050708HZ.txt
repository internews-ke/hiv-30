{"text": "\nDesire to have many children explained\nthere are social and economic reasons why the\nmajority of families in\ndeveloping countries\nprefer having as many\nchildren as possible.\nFirstly. this had been the case in\nprimary agricultural communities\nwhere a large number of children\nhave made it easier to share the\nwork.\nSecondly. even in modem\nwage employment economy.\nmany of the poor families will go\non having as many children as\npossible in the hope of getting\none or two who will achieve advanced\neducation and, hopefully therefore  get a good job.\nSuch a child is then expected\nto help the parents in providing\nthe rest of the family with their\nbasic needs. This is no longer\nachievable and is the reason behind\na lot of youth prostitution.\ndelinquency and drug abuse. It\nalso facilitates the spread of\nAids.\nThere is a real need to intensify\nfamily health education for the\nmothers and immunisation of the\nchildren.\nSuch family health education\nneeds to reach all members of the\nfamily and teach then about nutrition\nand cleanliness. It is also necessary to develop\nthose aspects of the health services\nwhich facilitate the prevention\nof the common diseases\nwhich affect children. Our aids against Aids are in continually educating families\nabout the importance of\nhaving the number of children\nthat they can take care\nof and intensifying their immunisation. Thirdly. where children are traditionally\nnamed at1er famous persons.\nplaces and events, grandparents,\nuncles. aunts and other\nrelatives. there is an effort to try\nand name as many of them as\npossible.\nToday. however. it is not feasible\nto do so without going beyond\nthe ability of the family to\ntake care of the children adequately.\nIn any case. the persons\nand events named are unlikely to\nbe of any help to the family in\nbringing up the children.\nThe question then is how to\ndevelop a culturally acceptable\neducation which removes the\nneed to try and name all the relatives.\nfamous personalities and\nimportant events but instead\nhelps the family to enable the\nfew children they have to progress\nsocially and economically.\nFourthly. there are communities\nwho hold traditional prejudices\nagainst one another which\nmay have resolved from past inter-\nethnic fighting in the process\nof acquisition of cattle. land and\nother resources. In such circumstances\nthe different communities\nwill each have developed fears\nabout the other.\nBecause of this. the increase in\nnumbers of one community will\nhave been seen as a threat by the\nother. Each community will have\nneeded enough warriors, and\nenough  women to produce the\nwarriors. in case of war.\nThis is why such inter-community\nfighting often has traditionally\ninvolved killing of boys and\ncapturing of girls by the invaders.\nThis has ensured that the invaders have\nhad more women to produce\nmore warriors than those invaded.\nSuch communities will therefore\neach culturally programme\nsex for the purpose of having as\nmany children as possible. Even\nafter the traditional inter-community fighting has come to an end.\nthere may still be political rivalry\nthat has sustained this competitive\ngrowth of the population.\nAids has made it necessary for\nall communities to co-operate to\navoid being wiped out by this\nepidemic which does not respect\nethics, racial or religious\nboundaries.\nThis is because such communities\nwho hold prejudices\nagainst one another continue to\npromote strong and emotional attachments\nto their own ethnic\ngroups whose traditional customs\nthey continue to follow strongly.\nThey constantly discredit each\nother's customs and. most importantly.\nteach the same prejudice\nto their children, thereby perpetuating\nsuch prejudices in subsequent\u2019 generations.\n** .\u2022.. Our aids against Aids are ensuring\nthat our sociocultural\npractices do not help to\nspread the epidemic. From the point of view of balancing\npopulation development, the\nethnic or racial groups must realise\nthat. in the long. run. the population\ngrowth which is based on\ncompetitive breeding will be\nharmful to all of them.\nThe removal of prejudice is\nthus a vital step towards the development\nof mutually acceptable\nsystem of social ethics and\nmoral values for balanced population\ndevelopment. It is also vital\nin the control of Aids. Out aids against Aids are in\nextracting the best aspects of\nthe multiplicity of our social\nvalues and ethics and using\nthem to strengthen a\nnational code of behavior \n\nOlder men and\nyounger women\nYoung women whose first male\nsex partner is three or more years\nolder engaged in more HIV risk\nbehaviour than young women\nwhose first male sex partner is\nroughly their age (same age or\nless than two years younger or\nolder), according to a study conducted\nby DHAP researchers\nKim Miller and Janet Moore.\nData from a survey of 150 sexually\nactive African-American\nand Hispanic female teenagers\nattending public high schools\nshowed that 355 had a first male\nsex partner three or more years\nolder than themselves.\nCompared with teenagers\nwhose first partner was roughly\ntheir own age. adolescents with\nan older partner were:- o Younger at the time of first intercourse\n(13.8 years vs 14.6). o Less likely to use a condom at\nfirst intercourse (63 per cent vs\n82 per cent).\no Less likely to report using a\ncondom at last intercourse (29\nper cent vs 44 per cent).\n'!:..l Less likey to report using a\ncondom in the previous six\nmonths (44 per cent vs 66 per\ncent). o Less likely to report usi.ng\ncondoms consistently over their\nlifetimes (37 per cent vs. 56 per\ncent). o More likely to have ever been\npregnant (38 per cent vs 12 per\ncent).\nResearch has shown that older\nsex partners pose a greater risk\nfor HIV because they are more\nlikely to have had multiple partners.\nto have had more varied\nsexual and drug use experiences  (eg. An intercourse and/or injection  with HIV than same-age adolescent sex partners. The potential\npower imbalance caused by\ndifferences in age and sexual experience also can create risk for\nyoung women with older male\npartners. Teenage women may\nlot be able to negotiate condom\nuse with an older partner or may\nrust the older. more experienced\npartner to take responsibility for\nhe health consequences of the\nsexual interaction. Additionally.\nevidence suggests that first\nsexual experiences can contribute\nto sexual \"scripts,\" or ideas\nabout sexual interactions (e.g.,\nthat condoms are used only for\ncontraception. not HIV prevention).\nThese sexual scripts can\nthen be played out in the future\nwith the same or different\npartners. ~\nFindings from this study suggest that HIV prevention programs targeting young women\nshould emphasise the increased\nrisk for infection an older male\nsex partner may pose. Programs also should recognise\nthat young women may lack the\nnegotiation skills needed for self-protective behaviours during sexual\nencounters. especially with\nolder. experienced partners.\ntherefore. interventions should\neach communication and negotiation skills that specifically address\nhow older partners may resent barriers to enacting these\nskills. Interventions should explore issues related to adolescents' implicit trust that an older\npartner is not infected or is taking the necessary precautions."}
