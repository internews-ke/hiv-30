{"text": "Debt must go, media talks conclude\nBy EVANS OMBIRO\nA Tanzanian cleric stunned hi,\naudience when he charged that, all\npresent, including their unborn\nchildren and relatives, were HIV\u00b7\npositive. Shocked, his listeners\nturned to look at each other, seeking confirmation.\nNot until he explained that he\nwas referring to the financial\n'Aids' that had gripped the South\ndid his audience at a hotel in Arusha understand him.\n\"We are HIV-positive -\nheavily Indebted Victims,\" announced Reverend Gabriel Kimirei of the Evangelical Lutherar\nChurch in Tanzania's Diocese in\nArusha.\nHe was delivering the opening\nspeech during a regional medi,\nconsultative workshop whose\ntheme was, \"Debt cancellation,\nmust\" .\nHis prescription for this fatal\ncondition?\nThe North should forgive the\nSouth its debts, in line with the Bible's teachings.\nMost of Africa's debt is owed\nto rich-country governments, or to\nmultilateral institutions like the\nWorld Bank and the International\nMonetary Fund.\nThe debt burden has emaciated\nthe bodies of Africans and turned\nthem into skeletons as poverty\nbites harder.\nThe reverend's HIV claim was\none of the numerous analogies\nthat characterised presentations at\nthe workshop organised by the\nChristian Partners Development\nAgency for the media in Eastern\nand Southern Africa to discuss the\ndebt crisis.\nMr Richard Chidowore from\nZimbabwe equally stopped participants\nin their tracks when he\nclaimed that, the problem with his\ncountry was 'IMF'.\n\"Not the Washington-based\nbody's fault,\" he hastened to clarify\nto his audience. \"In Zimbabwe,\npeople say 'It is Mugabe's\nFault.' The Zimbabwean economy is\ncurrently reeling under the weight\nof skyrocketing prices of basic\ncommodities. This, explains Mr\nChidowore, has been occasioned\nby the country's involvement in\nthe Democratic Republic of Congo\nwar and the government's increasing\nthe price of oil by 67 per\ncent which led to public unrest.\nHe said: \"In the DRC fiasco,\nMr Mugabe deployed 6,000 soldiers\non August 2, without consulting\nthe electorate. Zimbabwe\nspends between 50 and 60 million\ndollars a day to keep the soldiers\nthere. \"\nThe tax-payers are not consulted\non actions by their leaders that\nwill see them paying debts.\nHe said corruption, over-concentration\nof power in the hands\nof one person, a rubber-stamp parliament,\ndecreasing. currency\nvalue - everything wrong - \"is\nlinked to Mugabe's actions\".\nHe cited the Constitution which\nbars other contenders as an exam example\nof the President's wrongs.\nMr Mugabe tried to clear the\nNational Oil Corporation's debts\nby increasing the price of oil on\nOctober 31, but this backfired. It\ninstead spiralled commodity\nprices. Commuter transporters increased\nfares by 100 per cent,\nforcing workers to boycott\nvehicles and demonstrate against\nthe rise.\n\"Mr Mugabe acted against advice\nin trying to clear the corporation's\ndebt by increasing prices,\"\nsaid Mr Chidowore.\n\"We were cheated at independence\nto take loans whose implications\nwe did not understand,\"\ncharged Rev Kimirei. \"We lost\nour freedom. We are all slaves to\nthe international banking\nsystem. \"\nAccording to him, asking poor\nnations to pay the debts, as a Maasai\nsaying puts it, is like asking a\ndonkey to give one horns, when it\nis known that donkeys are naturally\nborn without horns. \"We are poor, we cannot pay the debt even\nif we are willing,\" he said.\nHe likened the debt problem as\na fresh enslavement of people in\npoor countries which became independent\nabout 50 years ago.\nThe generation born after independence\nin these nations is not\nfree, but chained to their parents'\ndebts.\nSince July 1998, Tanzanians\nhave been paying a 20 per cent\nValue Added Tax, money which\ngoes to pay interest on debts, The\neffect, he says, is an increased\nnumber of children missing education,\nhigher medical costs, increased\npoverty, \"because everything\ncosts 20 per cent more\".\nOther African countries similarly\nspend a lot of money repaying\ndebts, with little left to fund\nsocial services, Natural resources\nare raped or funds obtained from\nother sources is eaten by the debt.\nCPDA notes with concern that,\nAfrica is currently the greatest recipient\nof international aid from governments, multilateral institutions\nand non-governmental agencies. \"All these monies come in\nthe name of development, however,\nwhat we are witnessing is constant\nstarvation, poverty, unemployment,\nin a lump sum, we are\nwitnessing a planned painful slow\ndeath of this great continent,\"\nsays the organisation in the first\nissue of Across Afrika, its\nmonthly bulletin focusing on the\nJubilee 2000 campaign across the\ncontinent.\nRev Kimirei cited cases of Papua\nNew Guinea and Tanzania\nwhere indigenous people have\nlost out because their governments\nhave to allow international\ncreditors to clean their environments\nof livelihoods.\nIn both cases, he said, the natives\ndid not benefit.\nThe: growing debt burden thus,\nexacerbates the poverty in poor\ncountries. The poor are often the\nones who bear the brunt of the'\ndebt."}
