{"text": "Asia expected to lead in Aids infections\nThe centre of gravity of Aids epidemic\nis shifting from Africa to\nAsia, and barring an unexpected\nbreakthrough in medical research,\nby the year 2000, most new HIV\ncases will occur in Asia.\nWHO estimates that about 3.5\nmillion people have been infected\nwith HIV, and cumulative infections\nin the region are expected to\nquadruple to more than 10 million\nby the year 2000. Currently there\nare two primary foci of HIV/Aids in\nAsia: (a) ; India; and (b) Cambodia, Myanmar and Thailand.\n It is anticipated that the greatest\nepidemics of HIV/Aids will occur\nin the world's most populous developing\ncountries: China, India, and\nIndonesia.\nThese 'epidemics, still in their\nearly stages, may dwarf the epidemics\nfrom which sub-Saharan\nAfrica has suffered for the past decade.\nAcross Asia the epidemic has\nbecome well established where\nhigh risk behaviour related to intravenous\ndrug use and commercial\nsex is prevalent.\nAt present, parts of Cambodia, India, Myanmar, and Thailand are\nparticularly affected. In places, the\nrate of increase in HIV prevalence\noutstrips what Africa has experienced.\nPolitical commitment is an\nessential prerequisite for an effective\nresponse.\nIn the currently less affected\nAsian states, the degree of seriousness\nwith which the authorities\nview the issue varies enormously.\nThe World Bank's attention to\nHIV in Asia began early. In 1988,\nan offer was made to the Government\nof Thailand to assist with its programme  to combat HIV. Laudably,\nthe Thai Government decided\nto finance its own programme. This\nfirst step by the Bank was followed\nby the first HIV project in Asia, in\nIndia in 1992.\nIn response to the rapidly growing\ncrisis, the Bank is expanding its\nfunding for HlV/Aids prevention in\nAsia. Beyond the sheer magnitude\nof the anticipated HIV/Aids epidemic,\nthe Bank is investing in HIV/\nAids control in Asia because the\nproblem is still controllable.\nInvestments in HIV/Aids control prior to the presence of high rates of\nHIV in the general population are\nmuch more likely to be cost-effective\nthan investments in HIV control\nwhen the epidemic is mature.\nBoth large and small countries in\nAsia have the opportunity to take\neffective action now, and consequently\navoid facing a severe situation\nin the near future. The World\nBank is currently supporting six\nHIV/Aids projects in Asia, and expects\nthis number to increase.\n-Reprinted from \"The World\nBank and HN /Aids\""}
