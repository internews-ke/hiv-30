{"text": "High HIV rate in\nwomen calls for\nrevised strategy\n\nDAILY NATION, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 1996\n\nBy CATHERINE MGENDI\nMore women than men are currently\ninfected with Aids/Hiv because\nof their social and economic subordination,\na recent survey indicates.\n\"The rate of HIV infection\namong women is rising not because\nof women's greater biological vulnerability\nto the virus, but more as a\nresult of deeply ingrained gender\ninequalities,\" says Family Health\nInternational (FHI) which undertook\nthe survey.\nFHI projects that by the year\n2000, as many as 13 million women\nwill be infected with the Aids virus,\nthe majority of whom will be living\nin developing countries. Four million\nof these women will have lost\ntheir lives to the disease. Currently,\nmore than seven million women are\ninfected with Aids/HlV worldwide.\nThese statistics show that just as\nmany women, if not more,as men\nare now infected with the Aids virus\nas compared to one HIV-positive\nwoman for every 10or more infected\nmen ten years ago.\nFHI, a non-profit research and\ntechnical assistance organisation,\ndeals with issues of contraceptive\ndevelopment, family planning, reproductive\nhealth and Aids prevention.\n. In one of its publications, Aids\nCaptions, FHI says the Aids/HIV\ninfection trends among women had\nlittle to do with changes in\nbehaviour or biology. The.high infection\nrates were due to the fundamental\nissues of power and control.\nBecause of economic dependence\non, and social subordination\nto men, women lack the power to\ncontrol and determine matters that\naffect most aspects of their lives.\nWomen's lowly social status,\ncoupled with a limited access to\neconomic resources, had instilled\nmorbid fear in women forcing them\nto succumb to whatever men demanded\nof them without voicing\ntheir need for safety, for instance,\nby insisting on the use of condoms.\nFHI says: \"Petrified of physical\nassault, abandonment and economic\nruin, millions of girls and women\nthroughout the world have their\nhealth and general well-being compromised\nevery day\".\nFurthermore; demands or even\nrequests. made by women on their\npartners for safety measures are\neasily frustrated because they tradi-\ntionally reflect badly on women's\n\"chastity\" .\nThe Aids Captions magazine\nsays the common behaviour change\nmessages often (such as \"Use'\ncondoms every time you. have\nsex\") entirely bypass the issue of\nwho controls whether or not the\ncondom would be used. This insensitivity\nhas \"resulted in gross disinterest\namong many women who.\ngenerally ignore such efforts as\nthey (women) had failed to find any\nvalue in such strategies.\nQuoting the Vice-President of\nthe Washington-based International\nCentre for Research on Women.\nDr Geeta Rao Gupta, FHI says Aids\ncontrol programmes should be\nlinked to existing economic interventions\nsuch as women's agricultural\nextension services, cooperatives\nor credit programmes, in order\nto maximise on the efficiency of\nfinancial resources and skills.\nDr Gupta also says that the unfortunate\nAids status of women\nprovided the golden opportunity for\ngender activists to push for policy\nchanges that would improve the socio-\neconomic status of women.\nThis could be accomplished by advocating\nfor improved access to\neducation and productive resources\nas Aids was not only devastating'\nwomen, but also the entire community\nAids prevention programmes\nhave also to blame for the escalating\ninfection rates among women,\nFHI says, for generally failing to\nencompass a broader perspective in\ntheir management efforts.\nFHI says Aids control programmes\nhave previously been\nbased on the \"misguided belief'\nthat the virus was only a problem\nfor sex workers, and other \"high\nrisk groups\" resulting in little, if\nany, attention to the supposed\n\"risk-free\" groups - typically\ntaken to mean married women, or\npersons who are faithful to their\nmonogamous relations.\nThe Aids virus is now known to\nbe non-discriminative in its choice\nof victims. It has transcended the\nartificial boundaries laid 'down by\nmainstream science, and is being\npassed to most of the s.upposed\n\"risk free\" women by their\nspouses.\n. The findings of a recent study\ncarried out in Nairobi by the University\nof Nairobi Collaborative\nAids/STD Group among the \"Iowrisk\"\ngroup of women revealed the\nprevalence of HIV infections to be\nan unexpectedly high 12 per cent.\nFollowing the findings,- the scientists\nrecommended the implementation\nof long-term prevention\nstrategies which should address the\nissues of education, employment\nand empowerment for women.\nFHI supports the recommendation\nadding that HIV-control programmes\nwould be most effective\nin achieving their goals by taking\non a different kind of strategy that\nwould empower women economically, legally, socially and psychologically.\nIt says women's powerlessness\nhad led to Aids control programmes\nbeing built around the needs and\npeculiarities of men, advocating for\na change in their behaviour, but\nwithout challenging the underlying\nfactors that influence how men behave\n\"implicitly conveying a passive\nacceptance of the unchangeable\nnature of social roles and male\nsexuality\" .\n\"Social systems are not immutable,\"\nthe family. health body says\nrecommending the provision of\neducative information on Aids/HIV\nwhich should not reinforce gender\nstereotypes. Communicating information\nthat perpetrates an irresponsible,\npredatory, violent image of\nmale masculinity and sexuality\n. must stop, and that of responsible\nand respectful behaviour promoted.\nThe current infection trends\namong women could be reversed\nby providing not only information on the disease, but also on sex\neducation and an orientation on\nthe functioning of their reproductive\nsystem without any excuses as the\ninformation was easily and readily\navailable.\nThe institution also recommends\nfor the development of more HIV prevention\nmethods over which\nwomen had control, and readily\navailed at affordable prices. Some\nof the methods currently, but not\neasily available, are the female condom\nand microbic ides. Aids-related\nservices should also be integrated\nwith others and provided at the\nconvenience of women so that they\ndid not have to spend too much time\nmoving to and fro."}
