{"text": "Exploit nuclear science potential\nI was amused. recently to learn that there is in this\ncountry an institute of nuclear science.\nThis institute, I heard about on the Kenya\nBroadcasting Corporation's television\nprogramme~ Professional View.\nHowever. was even more impressed to learn\nthat not only do we have a nuclear science institute,\nbut we also boast a number of nuclear scientists.\nThis, I should say, is good news.\nHowever, most Kenyans will agree with me\nthat nuclear science is one field that has been neglected\nin this country.\nThough we have a nuclear science institute as\nwell as a number of nuclear scientists, most Kenyans\nare not aware of their existence.\nI am not a scientist but listening to the views\nexpressed by our learned brothers who have specialised\nin this field, I got the impression that\nonly a small percentage of the vast nuclear energy\nhas been put to use in this country, and this is\nbasically in the area of medicine.\nI was however impressed by the confidence with which the scientists handled this particular\nsubject. They appeared conversant with the subject,\nan indication that we have good nuclear scientists\nand the potential of producing more.\nHowever. I do strongly feel that much more\nresearch needs to be done in this field. Today, we\nare talking of the demand for electrical energy\noutstripping supply. This I would say is bad\nnews for industrial growth.\nThe need for an alternative source of industrial\nenergy other than hydro and geothemal power\nshould be given serious thought.\nAggressive research should be mounted now\non the possiblity of building a nuclear power\nstation in Kenya as a priority.\nRecently, 1asked a professor at the University\nof Nairobi how far they had gone in Aids research.\nHe told me little had been done so far. the\nreason being that research had been hampered by\nlack of modem equipment. He gave me as an example\nthe shortage of powerful microscopes.\nHe said there are only two in the whole country. One is at Nairobi University~ while the other\nis at the Kenya Medical Research Institute.\nThe lack of such vital equipment is perhaps an\nindication of the pathetic situation in our institutions\nof higher learning and research centres.\nToday, resourceful and productive Kenyans\ncontinue to lose their lives due after suffering\nfrom diseases even doctors cannot explain, just\nbecause research has not be done,\nThese diseases~ are not necessarily Aids, because\nthe victims don't test positive for the HIV virus.\nGoing back to the Professional View\nprogramme, one gentleman said that there is a\nlinkage between HIV and ultraviolet rays but he\ndid not elaborate.\n, I urge KBC' to bring on the Professional\nView, next time, doctors, especially those involved\nin research to tell us what they are doing\nto curb the spread of the increasing number of '\ndiseases.\nConcerned Citizen.\nNairobi."}
