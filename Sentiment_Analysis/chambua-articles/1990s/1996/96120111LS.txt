{"text": "The dreaded virus has made a deadly mark in the entertainment industry\nBVJOHN KARIUKI\nThe deaths of celebrities continue to provide a\ndevastating example on the spread of HIV and'\nthe Aids virus.\nThe latest victim is world heavyweight championship\ncontender Tommy Morrison whose HIV\ndiagnosis has put an end to what appeared to be\nan eminent journey to the top of the world boxing\nranks. But like others in the glamour world,\nMorrison has since become one of the new celebrity\ncrusaders for Aids awareness.\nThe first big name to die of Aids was actor\nRock Hudson whose death shocked many of his\nfriends and colleagues some of whom had\nwatched and shared in his promiscious sex life.\nNews that he had led a reckless, bisexual lifestyle\nwas to compound the effect and many\nwondered just how far he could have spread the\n,disease.\nBut more than anything else, his candid confession\nto being HIV helped sensitise those in\nthe industry who had doubted the reality of Aids\nin Hollywood. Hence his tragedy became a lesson\nto those in a business where sex symbolism\nhas remained a vital marketing tool\nThat reality has been illustrated by the increasing\ndeaths from Aids of big stars in both\nthe music and film industry circles.\nThe shock of Freddie Mercury's death in 1989\nand the publicity from it became the reference\nin rock music forums which has now become\nthe most active campaigner for Aids awareness.\nIn black American music, the death in the\nlate 80s of Sylvester, the star who gained international\nacclaim with his hit Mighty Real, is\nthe first known case in the entertainment circles.\nLike Mercury, Sylvester made no secret\nabout being gay.\nIn Africa, Uganda's Philly Lutaya was the\ncontinent's first confessed Aids victim and as\nhis health worsened, he used his music to\nspread the awareness that Aids did not discriminate. He was followed by Zimbabwe's Mbundu\nBoys singer Biggy Tembo whose courage in facing\nup to\u00b7 his condition and his relentless campaign\nto raise the awareness won the admiration\nof others notably British pop star Cliff\nRichard ..\nIn Kenya, reports have not been as clear but\nthere are rumours that some of the musicians\nwho have died in the past decade have been victims\nof Aids related complications.\nIn sports, the news of Magic Johnson's HIV\ncondition was to spread a parallel impact in the\nsporting world and Johnson's own enthusiasm\nand charisma' has helped sensitise athletes on\nthe vulnerability of celebrities to the Aids causing\nvirus.\nThe introduction of mandatory health checkups\nin competitive sports has probably been the\nmost important element in sports and has\nhelped to detect infections early enough to inform\nthe victim and hence curb a possible spread. As the threat of Aids in the entertainment industry grows, industry practitioners are\ncalling for a similar health requirement to ensure\nthat fellow entertainers arc aware of any\npossible infection at the earliest possible time.\nThose lobbying for the introduction of these\ntests also hope to include drug screening tests\nsaying that injection drugs like heroin have also\ncontributed to the spread of HIV in entertainment\ncircles.\nA corresponding lobby for the acceptance of\nhomosexuality as a normal sexual preference\nmay have also come as a result of Aids working\ntowards erasing the stigma that has associated\n'homosexuality with Aids. A recent example is\nthe documentary film Celluloid Closet starring\nTom Hanks and Whoopie Goldberg which focuses\non gay life in Hollywood. Those in the lobby\nfor compassion to gay people, freely praise\ntheir gay friends and state that gays arc normal\npeople and one need not be gay to have homosexual\nfriends. Two months ago, a compact disc\ntitled America is Dying Slowly was released and\nhas targeted rappers. The effect of these could\nbe responsible for the now increased openness\nabout homosexuality and promiscuous sex\namong celebrities. British pop Stars like Elton\nJohn who have been active in Aids-related music\nconcerts made his disclosure in a British\nnewspaper two years ago and more have .followed.\nRecord companies have also dropped the\nsex symbol label which was the winning tag\nmainly among black male and replaced it with a\nmore friendly tag of a family man which is conducive\nin promoting family values in these\ntimes of Aids.\nThe trend in HIV infection continues and as\none Lifebeat official said, while celebrities seek\nt9 make all the right career choices to create\n. his; many keep making all the wrong choices in\ntheir social life and in turn, end up being hit by\na disease that has no cure.\n\nMagic Johnson: \"His charisma and\nenthusiasm a source of hope.\""}
