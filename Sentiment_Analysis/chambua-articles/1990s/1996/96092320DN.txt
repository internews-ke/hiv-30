{"text": "Where have all boxing's\ngreat white hopes gone?\nFor decades professional heavyweight\nboxing has been dominated\nby black fighters, mainly from\nNorth America.\nIn. the past there was always a\nhighly-rated white boxer or two\nranked among the world's best but\nthey have now virtually, disappeared\nfrom even' the top 10\nheavyweights ..\nThe last heavyweight \"Great\nWhite Hope\" was Tommy Morrison\nwho briefly held the title belt issued\nby the lightly regarded World\nBoxing Organisation (WBO), but\nhe retired last year after going public with the news that tests had confirmed\nhe had contracted the\nHuman Immune-deficiency Virus\n(HIV), the virus that causes the\ndreaded - and still incurable -\nAcquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome\nor AIDS.\nBoth before and after losing the\nWBO crown, Morrison's only real\nclaims to a top ranking were a\npoints victory over ,George Foreman,\na 46 year-old preacher and\ngrandfather, and a knockout of Ken\nNorton, who was briefly champion\nin the early 1980s before losing the\ntitle to Larry Holmes.\nThe reason that Morrison's defeat\nof\" Big George\" added much needed,\nif scant, lustre to his record\nwas that Foreman was a gold medallist\nfor the United ,States at the\n1968 Mexico City Olympic Games\nand after turning professional, he\nwent on to knock out Joe Frazier in\n1973 to become undisputed world\nheavyweight champion .. ,\nQuitting the ring after losing his title to the legendary Muhammad\nAli and then being 'defeated by Jimmy\nYoung, Foreman made a come..\nback almost 20 years later _.\nweighing in at well over 250\npounds. Successive victories over\nnonentities eventually earned Foreman\na 10-round knockout victory\nover Michael Moorer in 1994, making\nhim the World Boxing Association\n(WBA) and International Boxing\nFederation (lBF) champion and,\nthe oldest man ever to win a heavyweight title.\nMorrison's other \"big-name'\"\nvictim was Norton, a former marine\nwho won fame in 1973when he be..\ncame only the second man - after\nFrazier - to defeat Ah, breaking\nthe 1egend's jaw in a non-title fight.\n. To achieve a top ranking in the division, a white fighter apparently needs only one powerful punch in\neither hand - it was a left hook for\nMorrison - while a black fighter\nmust toil up through the ranks to attain\ncontender status, no matter\nhow promising his talent.\nAnother example was Gerry\nCooney, who was awarded a title\nfight against Larry Holmes in the\nearly 1980s when the world had\nbarely heard of him. His credential\nwas a powerful right-hand punch\nthat had put several carefully selected but non-threatening opponents\nto sleep.\nSo incensed was Holmes, the\nchampion, at this blatant favouritism\nthat he spoke out forcefully on the issue, earning some severe criticism\nfrom the white boxing media\nestablishment who branded him an\n\"ungracious\" champion and a\nracist.\nThe champion's bitterness\nspilled over into the fight and he\npunished Cooney mercilessly,\n\"carrying\" the challenger for several\nmore rounds than was necessary\nto expose his utter lack of talent.\nNot long afterwards, Michael\nSpinks, the undefeated lightheayweight\nchampion who had dethroned\nHolmes, knocked Cooney\nout in four rounds, sending the\n\"Great White Hope\" into boxing\noblivion.\nHowever there were a few white\nhopes who 'were genuine contenders.\nFormer British heayweight\nchampion Joe Bugner went the full\n15 rounds with both Frazier and Ali\nin the 1970s without suffering a single\nknock-down.\nThe late Oscar Bonavena of Argentina\nwas the first man to knock\nFrazier off his feet. He also produced\na performance that almost\noverwhelmed Ali in the second\nfight - after Jerry Quarry - of his\n1970 comeback from a three-year\nring exile.\nBut the white grip on the boxing\nestablishment has been loosened by\nthe arrival of people like Don King\nand the abundance of black talent\nand it is no longer so easy to make\nwhite boxers with minimal talent\ninto championship material."}
