{"text": "Powerful drug cocktails that could hit Aids fast and hard\nIn a pioneering attempt to cure\nAIDS, doctors are giving a powerful combination of drugs to newly infected men to see if they\ncan permanently wipe out the\nvirus.\nThe idea is to hit HIV fast and\nhard before it becomes deeply\nestablished in the body. No one\nknows if it will work, but the\ndoctors believe they may have\nan answer later this year when\nthey stop giving the medicines\nto their patients.\n\"We are treading in an area\nwhere no one has tread before,\"\nDr Martin Markowitz of the\nAaron Diamond Aids Research\nCenter in New York City said on\nThursday.\nDrug cocktails made up of\ntwo older Aids medicines plus a\nnew class called protease inhibitors are the hottest innovations in Aids therapy. Many experiments are under way, and several preliminary reports were presented at the 11th International\nConference on Aids in Vancouver'\nCanada.\nThe combination of AZT, 3Te\nand ritonavir can eliminate all\nmeasurable traces of HIV in the\nblood, even when given to people\nwho have been infected for several\nyears.\nBut many doubt this approach\nwill kill every last trace\nof the virus, especially if it has\nburrowed into the brain and\nother parts of the body that are\nhard to reach with drugs.\nStill, doctors believe they have\nthe best chance of completely\neradicating the virus from the\nbody if they start treatment very\nearly in the infection.\nIf that works, they might also\nbe able to clear out the virus in\nsome people with longer infecions,\nespecially as new drugs\nbecome available.\nDr David Ho, another Diamond\nresearcher, said that within\ntwo weeks, the three-drug approach\nkills all virus in the\nblood stream as well as infected\ncells that are producing new\ncopies of the virus.\nBut the virus lingers in disease fighting cells and macrophages.\nHe estimated that it\nwould take one to three years\nfor all of the infected cells in\nthese so-called viral compartments to die off.\nAt that point, theoretically,\nthe infection is cured - assuming\nit is not hidden somewhere\nelse, such as the brain. Testing\nthat is the goal of the new experiment,\nbeing conducted on\nnine volunteers.\n\"No patient has been cured,\"\nHe said, \"but we want to find out if it is possible or not to have each of the viral compartments\nburn out.\"\nPeople frequently don't learn\nthey are infected until many\nyears after infection, when a\nblood test shows they are producing\nantibodies to HIV. But\nthe initial infection often\ncauses a brief, flu-like illness,\nwhich can be a tip-off to an infection.\nThe study subjects - all homosexual\nmen - suspected they\nhad caught the virus and volunteered\nfor the tests between last\nAugust and February. Tests revealed high levels of the virus, so all began treatment within\nabout two months of infection.\nSo far, all evidence of the virus has disappeared from the patients' blood. When the first volunteer\nfinishes a year of therapy\nin September, doctors hope to sample his lymph nodes to search for traces of the virus. If\nnone are found, they plan to stop\ngiving him the drugs and see\nwhat happens.\nIf the virus is still hidden\nsomewhere in his body, the doctors\nexpect it will soon start reproducing\nagain and become detectable.\n\"These data are very encouraging\nand absolutely crucial to\ngoing ahead,\" said Dr Joep\nLange of the Academic Medical\nCenter in Amsterdam.\nHowever, he speculated that it\nmay be necessary to pump the\nvirus-killing drugs directly info\nthe central nervous system to\nhunt down lingering bits of\nHIV. '\nMarkowitz compared the\nstrategy to putting out a raging\nfire.\n\"We want to treat immediately\nand not with a glass of water\nor a garden hose but a fire hose,\nshe said. \"You must keep the\nwater going to put out the embers.\"\nMeanwhile, new research on\nmeasles, which kills as many as\ntwo million children each year\ncould help shed light on the opportunistic infections' that\nattack Aids patients, scientists\nreported on Thursday.\nOne of the ways measles kills\nis by attacking the immune systems\nof the children who contract it, leaving them vulnerable\nto other diseases, according to\nChristopher Karp, one of the authors\nof the report in the journal\nScience. Karp's research with\nother scientists found that what\nhappens in measles might also\nhappen in the case of HIV.\n-AP"}
