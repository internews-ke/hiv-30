{"text": "HIV victims make crowd weep\n\"However, all these big plans\nfor the future were shattered when\nthe doctor confirmed I was HIV positive,\"\nhe told the attentive\ncrowd which included Health\nMinister Joshua Angatia.\nAt first he refused to accept the\nresults and went for re-testing. It\ncame out positive.\nHe quit his job and moved out\nof town to settle elsewhere among\nstrangers. It was only through\ncounselling that he gathered the\nstrength and courage to live positively\nwith the disease.\nHe challenged those infected\nwith the virus not to seek revenge\nor lead withdrawn lives but come\nout and preach against the\nscourge. Ms Omuga, a former midwife\naged 43 was beaten and kicked out\nof her matrimonial home together\nwith her children immediately she\ninformed her husband that she\nwas HlV-positive.\nShe also could not believe that\nit was true until three tests confirmed\nit. Since then, \"life has\nbeen hell\". She lost her job and\nshelter and has since been subsisting\nthrough the mercy of well wishers.\n\"It is only counselling which\nhas given me the strength to continue\nliving otherwise I had contemplated\ntaking my life,\" she\nsaid.\nShe said the stigmatisation and\nisolation of Aids victims made\nthem bitter and some resorted to\nrevenge by spreading the virus indiscriminately.\n\"We ask that the public treats us humanely to enables\nus to live positively with the\ndisease\" .\nThe sad morning tales gave\nway to an afternoon of drama performances\nand musical extravaganza\nby various groups on the\nkiller disease which blended well\nwith the day's theme: \"One\nworld, one hope\" . Melodies\nThem Mushrooms, Okatch\nBiggy, Queen Jane, Ochieng Kabaselle\nand Bilenge Musica\namong others belted out melodious\ntunes of benga, chakacha, lingala\nand muomboko which kept\nthe large crowd on their feet until\nlate in the evening. Manufacturers of condoms also\nused the opportunity to advertise\ntheir products.\nBut at the end of it all the message\nwas clear ~ Aids is sweeping\nthrough the globe like a bushfire\nwith no imminent cure in\nsight.\n\"The only solution is total abstinence\nfrom sex but if you can\nnot manage this then stick to your\npartner, failure to this, please use a\ncondom,\" was Mr Angatia's parting\nmessage.\nThe day marked globally under\nthe aegis of the United Nations\nwas celebrated in all district and\nprovincial headquarters with the\nkey objective being to sensitise the\npublic about the reality of Aids.\nQ Minister's speech, other reports\nand pictures Pages 14and"}
