{"text": "WE love this game\nThere is something captivating about a basketball\ngame. Is it because these big guys\n(and some small ones too) of the sport can\nmove with such grace as they make almost\nimpossible moves with the ball! Or perhaps it is\nthe speed and power with which they \"slam\ndunk\" after out maneuvering all opponents! Or\ncould it be the \"three pointers\" that make a difference\nwhen seconds count in determining a\ngame? One thing is certain: A good basketball\ngame is poetry in motion. And the many basketball\nfans agree. The sport is rapidly becoming one\nof the most popular in the world. It certainly is\ngaining more fans in Kenya.\nBasketball courts are springing up in most city\nestates. Matatus are adopting names of basketball\nstars and teams. You've probably come across\nsome called the Lakers, the Bulls and' Shark\nAttack, named after Shaquille O'Neal. And when\ngoing out on a casual date, an NBA cap, Chicago\nBulls T-shirt and shorts look really fancy.\nBasketball stars are the new role models for the\nyouth. Michael Jordan has popularised the \"bald\" look and the earring. No doubt the greatest basketball\nstar ever born. he makes flying look so easy ... until\nyou try it and you understand why he is the only one\ncalled Air Jordan!\nHowever, there are a lot of myths associated with\nbasketball. One of them is that basketball is a sport for\ntall guys only. This is not necessarily true. Yes. most\nbasketball stars are above six feet but there are short\nguys like Bugsy who are still good players. So, remember\nheight isn't everything. You may not make the\n\"Dream Team\" but you can still be a great basketball\nplayer and have a lot of fun too!\nAlthough most basketball stars start playing seriously\nwhen they are in college. age shouldn't really be\na factor. The youngest basketball player I know is three:\nyears old and he can out dribble a lot of older people!\nPlayers like Jordan, Sottie Pippen and Barkeley are\nall over 30, so you can never be too old to enjoy a\ngame. Basketball stars all look like the epitome of good health. In fact. it is hard to imagine that any of these\n. strong guys ever get sick. Magic Johnson stunned the\nworld when he announced that he was retiring from\nthe sport because he had contracted the Aids virus.\nHis return, four years later and the acceptance by his\nteammates was a milestone for HIV positive people.\nBasketball had gone beyond the stigma that has for so\nlong been associated with Aids.\nI'm sure you've heard another myth that claims\n\"white men can't jump.\" Although it is true that many\nbasketball stars are black, Larry Bird beat all odds to\nbecome one of the greatest basketball stars of all time.\nAnd if you are a girl, don't let anyone tell you that it is only a boys' game. Anyone can play basketball - or at\nleast have fun trying!\nNBA star Hakeem Olajuwon, the most famous basketball star  from Africa"}
