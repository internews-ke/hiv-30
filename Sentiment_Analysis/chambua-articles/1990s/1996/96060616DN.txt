{"text": "Sep 25, 96\n\n1.7m may have Aids by end of year\n\nBy NATION Correspondent\n\nMore than 1.7 million Kenyans may\nbe infected with the Aids virus by\nthe end of this year, the Regional Director\nof Aids Control and Prevention\nProject said yesterday.\nDr Godfrey Sikipa said the World\nHealth Organisation estimated that\nglobally, 7,000 people get infected\nwith the disease daily, while more\nthan 4,000 of the cases were in sub-\nSaharan Africa. \nHe was speaking during the\nlaunch of a programme for the education\nof security guards on Aids\nand other sexually transmitted diseases.\nThe launch was attended by\nmanagers of security firms and representatives\nof Family Health International.\nIt was sponsored by the\nProgramme for Appropriate Technology\nin Health (PATH) and\nUSAID.\nDr Sikipa said Kenya was one of\nthe countries where private companies\nhad taken up the fight against\nAids. '\n\"I urge more private firms to ensure\nthe health and future of the human being as the most important\nresource through the initiation of\nHIV control programmes at their\nwork places,\" he said. '\nThe director of PATH, Ms Margot\nZimmerman, said HIV prevalence\namong antenatal mothers was\n50 per cent in rural areas. Poor information\nlevels coupled with negative\nattitudes towards protective techniques\n increased the infection risk\namong security guards.\nMs Zimmerman said that although\nguards knew about the condom,\nthey did not understand its correct\nuse. \"While most guards have\nheard about STDs, they do not understand\nthe symptoms nor the\nmodes of transmission. \"\nSecurity firms represented at the\nlaunch included Bob Morgan, Se-.\ncuricor, Ultimate Factory Guards\nand Ears/Medivac.\nThe project's aim was to create\nawareness of HIV and STDs for security\nguards to adopt \"safer sex\"\nbehaviours. Pleas by security firms\noccasioned the programme, she said."}
