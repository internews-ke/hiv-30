{"text": "Condemned to Aids: Do\nThe question is what they\ncan do to prevent infection\nBy JEMIMAH MWAKISHA\nWith figures like one in every 18 being infected with HIV and with others like one in\nevery nine being infected in the urban centres, there's no doubt just how far the Aids\nvirus has hit society.\nSo far, 150,000 people are said to have died in Kenya but only one third of these are recorded\nin official health statistics.\nBut while experts scrounge for leading pointers towards finding a solution, (its over a decade by the\nway) and while preventive measures like condoms offer little consolation, there is now greater focus on\nwomen's role in preventing and controlling the disease.\nThe growing trend in this direction is the fact that women are more vulnerable and scientists are busy\ntrying to find out what women can do to prevent their being infected.\nBut are women more vulnerable than men? And why?\n\"Women have no control over their being infected,\" explains Dr Maina Kahindo, the deputy manager\nof Kenyan National Aids/STD control programme.\n\"They have no capacity to do anything about the risks and it is not their own behaviour that puts\nthem at risk.\"\nStudies, he says, show that women mention their\nregular partners or husbands as the only suspected\nsource of infection, while most men suspect prostitutes.\nCultural values also put them at more risk since\n\"even when they have evidence that the husband!\npartner is promiscuous, they cannot say no to sex,\"\nthe venereologist/dermatologist adds.\n\"Cultural upbringing makes it impossible for\nwomen to negotiate,\" Leah Wanjama, a gender expert\nadds.\nSex among Africans is a taboo subject which\nmakes it difficult even for partners to talk about it\nfreely. Dr Kahindo also adds that the fact that women are\nsubjected to low status puts them at the mercy of\nmen, while their low literacy levels deny them information. \"Even in the villages, men who own the radio go\nto graze with them denying women the chance of\ngetting information from them.\nBut other than that, the issue of power relations\nbetween men and women seems to have a heavy\nbearing on women's role in the prevention of the\ndisease.\n\"It is power relations and power control which\nmakes women powerless,\" Ms Wanjama says.\nWomen, she adds, have never controlled their reproductive\nlives, hence their inability to protect\nthemselves from HIV \"even when they know their\nspouse could be infected. \"\nShe also attributes the helplessness of women to\nlack of economic independence where unemployed\nwomen and girls depend on husbands and fathers respectively.\nRecent studies re-emphasise these observations\nand the fact that women are vulnerable not only because\nof their physical nature but due to gender relations.\nResearch carried out in 17 countries by the International\nCentre for Research on Women, Washington,\nstates that the \"power imbalance in gender relations\nis seen to be at the root of all vulnerability.\"\nThe research as reported by Aids Captions, a\nFamily Health International magazine, identifies obstacles\nthat make it difficult for women to prevent HIV infection.\nThese include sexual norms that limit women's\naccess to information by dictating that they must be\nignorant about sexual matters, women's economic\ndependence on men, violence against women and\nwidespread acceptance of male promiscuity.\nDr Kahindo says many conforming women are\nnot only unable to do anything about their partner's\npromiscuity but they cannot suggest the use of a\ncondom ..\n\"The dilemma most women face is that if they\nsuggest the use of a condom, their partner will think\nthey have been having affairs or are suspicious of\nthem,\" Ms Wanjama says.\nDr Kahindo says even those who appear knowledgeable\nabout issues may not be able to negotiate\nfor condom use. The growing question now is\nwomen can do to prevent their being infected.\nThe male condom, which is still the most effective\nand affordable means of prevention still remain,,~\nunpopular with users. But the fact that it is at the disposal\nof the man and he can chose not to wear it, puts\nthe woman at greater risk.\n\"More research is now addressing preventive\nmechanisms at the disposal of women, or women\ncontrolled methods,\" Dr Kahindo says.\nThis includes research on Virusides - agents put\ninto the vagina (like foam tablets) to kill HIV.\nThese can be used without the spouse knowing,\nhe adds. The Female condom is also being refined\nsince what has been in the market has been clumsy.\nCurrently Family Health International is doing a\nresearch in Kenya based on social-cultural issues as \n\n'The dilemma faced by\nmost women is that if\nthey suggest the use\nof a condom, their\npartner will think\nthey are unfaithful'"}
