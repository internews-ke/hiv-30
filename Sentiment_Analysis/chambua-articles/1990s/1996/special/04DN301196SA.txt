Kenya to mark World Aids Day tomorrow

By NATION CORRESPONDENT  
Kenya will join other counties in celebrating World Aids Day tomorrow.
In a Press release in commemoration of World Aids Day, United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said 22 million people are living with HIV/Aids while total number of Aids-related deaths had reached six million.
"Over 90 per cent of all new HIV infections occur in developing countries and programmes to prevent the spread of the infection have so far met limited success. 
“In addition, the new anti-viral therapies and treatments remain extremely costly and beyond the means of the vast majority of Aids sufferers in the developing world.”
Meanwhile, Population Service International will sponsor the Second Annual Trust Cycle Race on world Aids Day.
The race will be flagged off by USAID/Kenya Mission Director George Jones at 9 am.
The 88-kilometer race will start at Uhuru Park, through Kikuyu, Karen, Ngong and Kiserian before ending in Nairobi.
