Good news from doctors
VANCOUVER, Tuesday
Aids researchers presented solid
evidence yesterday that the disease
'has killed nearly six million
pie may now be treatable thanks
to "cocktails" of experimental
drugs.
Speakers at the 11th International
Conference on Aids drew cheers
and applause from nearly 15,000
delegates as they summed up recent
breakthroughs in combination drug
treatments, which for the first time
offer hope that Aids may no longer
be a death sentence.
But militant protesters, venting
the angry frustration that has
marked so much of the battle
against Aids, quickly accused drug
firms of profiteering with expensive
drugs that may never reach
most of the people infected with the
virus.
The doctors, however, remain e
cautiously upbeat.
The new drug mixes "have
taught us a lot about treatment ...
and hope for the future," said Dr.
Scott Hammer, head of the department
of infectious diseases at Boston's
Deaconess Hospital and Harvard
Medical School.
"Access and cost are major obstacles
to the Third World. But
there is hope for more and more results in the years to come and for control of the HIV virus."
The excitement centres on startling
results achieved by combining
new drugs, called protease inhibitors,
with more traditional anti
Aids treatments such as AZT and
other drugs.
Scientists are now voicing hope
these cocktails will batter the resilient
human immunodeficiency virus
into submission, perhaps eve eradicating it from the bodies of patients
now condemned to die.
"Just six months ago, this statement
would have been seen as faro'
fetched or even ludicrous," said Dr
Hammer.
Potent drug combinations including
protease inhibitors, which
attack an enzyme crucial to the
multiplication of HIV, have already
reduced the virus to undetectable
levels -in some patients, raised
counts of CD-4 immune cells, and
dramatically improved their health,
appearance and quality of life.
Despite the advances being trumpeted
at the conference, there is still
deep caution in dealing with a virus
that is a moving target. Until recently,
it has outsmarted researchers by
mutating - transforming itself into
different strains - and building
swift resistance to drug therapies. Dr Hammer, and many other scientists,
stressed that the new drugs
were promising but left many questions
unanswered.
"The jury's still out," said Dr
Michelle Daniels, a general practitioner
from Princeton, New Jersey,
who treats Aids patients.
Advocates of the new drug therapy
are leaning toward using the protease combinations in large doses in
the early stages of treatment to cut
the risk the virus will build resistance.
Dr Robert Gallo, a pioneer of
Aids research, summed up the approach
to new combination drug
therapy by saying: "HIV replication
causes Aids. Kill early and kill
it hard." Drug mixes including protease
inhibitors can cost around
$15,000 (Sh859,350) a year in the
United States. They are thus out of reach of patients
in the Third World, where the
United Nations estimates 90 percent
of the world's 21.8 million
HIV-infected people live.
The only course in Africa and
Asia is preventive medicine and the
hope, one day, of a vaccine. But a
vaccine is still a long way off.
Militant anti-Aids demonstrators
yesterday targeted Abbott Laboratories, one of the companies manufacturing
an expensive new. drug.
Protesters descended on an Abbott
display booth, tossed pharmaceutical literature onto the floor and
chanted slogans accusing the company
of profiteering.
Dr William Paul, Director of the
US Office for Aids Research said:
"Even if these drugs turn out to be
everything we had hoped for, a tremendous amount must still be done
to make sure those who need treatment are treated."
Countries like the US should
help Africa and Asia if only because
they were members of the
world community. But self-interest
was also involved, he noted. "We
cannot predict how the virus will
evolve," he said. (Agencies)

Gay men Ignore Aids Warning
VANCOUVER, Tuesday
A generation of young gay men
across the industrialized world,
tragically ignoring the lessons of
the Aids epidemic, risk a new wave
of HIV infection by engaging in
risky sex, researchers reported yesterday.
The trend, first spotted in San
Francisco a few years ago, has now
been documented across the United
States, Europe and Canada.
"The epidemic of HIV among
young gay men is not only an individual
tragedy but is certainly also a
major public health concern," said
Mr John de Wit, a psychologist at
the University of Utrecht in the
Netherlands.
Mr de Wit said large numbers of
gay men are becoming infected
with HIV before age is.
In some parts of the United
States, as many as one in 10 carries
the virus, and the risk seems to be
especially high for non white minorities.
"The figures are high, very high,
especially if we consider that these
young men have become sexually
active in an era in which massive
effort was exerted to increase
awareness of HIV risk behaviours
and to promote safer sex," he said.
A variety of surveys have found
that about one-third of young gay men
in their 20s typically engage in
anal sex without condoms, the riskiest
form of homosexual behaviour.

Birth control linked
to HIV susceptibility
VANCOUVER, Tuesday
Dr Arnaud Fontanet was looking
for a group of women for his HIV
research when he came across a
stunning figure: six of 19 factory
workers getting their birth control
in shots carried the virus.
The Ethiopian women, who were
studied as part of a project by the
Ethiopian-Netherlands Aids research
project, were all receiving
shots of Depo-Provera every three
months.
Dr Fontanet, who presented the
case study at the conference said
the women were in most other respects
similar to their co-workers
who used no contraception or took
the pill ..
They had no more partners, no
more casual sex and no more other
sexually transmitted diseases than
their co-workers, said Fontanet.
The study also ruled out, dirty needles at the clinic as the source of
The HIV.
A total of 6.5 per cent of women
at the factory who took the pill tested
positive for the human immunodeficiency
virus that causes Aids
while 7.8 per cent of women who
used no birth-control tested positive
for the HIV virus.
But 31.6 per cent of women getting
the Depoprovera carried the
deadly virus, he said.
"Birth control is key to developing
countries," cautioned Dr Fontanet.
Dr Fontanet's research turned up
no reason for the difference but one,
avenue of-investigation is that progesterone
used in birth control
products causes the vaginal walls to
thin, facilitating the transmission of
the virus that causes Aids, or acquired
immune deficiency syndrome. A preliminary study on a group
of monkeys found that monkeys
taking the hormone had a thinner
vaginal wall, but Dr Fontanet
warned that the same results may
not be found in humans.
Meanwhile, a triple combination
of Abbott Laboratori'es Inc.'s Norvir
and two other drugs has kept the
Aids virus at bay for 60 weeks in a
clinical trial, the company said yesterday.
. In an update presented at the
Conference Abbott said 17 patients
in France with advanced, previously
untreated HIV infection were
given Norvir, Glaxo Wellcome
Pic's AZT and Roche Holding
Ltd. 's Hivid. After 60 weeks on the
therapy, the count of the patients'
disease-fighti.ng CD4 cells rose to a
mean of 337 from a mean of ]55
cells, the company said in a statement.

Taylor criticises US
Canadian policies
VANCOUVER, Tuesday
Actress and Aids activist Elizabeth 
Taylor bitterly attacked the US and
Canadian governments yesterday
accusing Washington of committing
"premeditated murder" in
failing to fund Aids programmes.
She told a private reception at the
conference that euphoria over medical
advances did little to dispel the
reality - that most people with
HIV do not have access to drugs or
other treatments.
Ms Taylor, one of the first celebrity
Aids campaigners and a
founder and National Chairwoman
of the American Foundation for Aids Research (AmFAR), critised
US reluctance to fund programmes
to provide sterile needles
to drug users, as is done in some
European countries, as "a glaring
example of politics.
"In a society that proclaims to
value human life above all, the deliberate
withholding of the means
to self-protection is more than passive
neglect. It is a measured act of
premeditated murder."
Ms Taylor told the audience.
which included US Health Secretary
Donna Shalala. that too much
emphasis was being placed on
purely scientific research.(Reuter)

Rare move

Starting to pay the community back.
It invited Aids activists, researchers
mid community workers
attending the conference to aÂ· special
lunch to hear about its "positive
action programme" to work
with Aids groups, governments and
, health care providers. "We, the private
sector, the phannaceutical industry, have to recognize our responsibility,"
Mr Jim Niedel,
executive director for research and
development at Glaxo, said.(Reuter)
