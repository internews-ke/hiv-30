{"text": "Aids conference ends with hope\nVANCOUVER, Friday\nAids researchers, activists, doctors,\ncondom and drug manufacturers\nopened up the 11th International\non Aids yesterday amid\nthe next big target in Aids research.\nThe closure of the conference,\nthe most upbeat in years, was interrupted\nby a polite protest from ACT\nUP, chanting, \"Where's\nDingwall?\"\nA man who is HIV positive took\nthe stage criticizing Canadian\nHealth Minister Mr David Dingwall\nwho had left the conference\nwith the flu, sending a sarcastic note and flowers.\nThe activist also had suntan oil\nfor Prime Minister Jean Chretien,\nwho is on vacation and did not attend.\nConference organizers tolerated\nlimited protests aimed at government\nofficials and drug companies,\nwhich activists have accused of indifference\nand greed.\nResearch news from the conference\nwas dominated by an obscure\nnew class of drugs called protease\ninhibitors which bind to the human\nimmunodeficiency virus (HIV) that\ncauses Aids and prevent it from reproducing. These, used in various combinations,\nhave been shown to slash the\namount of HIV in the blood but\nhave only been tested in small\ngroups of people for no longer than\ntwo years.\n\"We're seeing a very dramatic\nanti-retroviral effect,\" said Dr David\nHo, director of the Aaron Diamond\nAids Research Center in New\nYork and one of the research stars\nof this conference.\nThe next big target could be the\nmechanism HIV virus uses to stick\nto and penetrate the healthy cell.\nsaid researcher Mr Nathanial Landau\nof the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in a study released yesterday.\nLittle has been known about how\nHIV access healthy cells. and Mr\nLandau found that it entered\nthrough a gateway named chemokine\nreceptor 5, pointing to another\nviable area of clinical research.\nBut, as was often pointed out in\nthe conference, developing nations\nunwilling or unable to ensure safe\ndrinking water to their poorest residents\nwill never be able to afford\nthe new protease inhibitors that - at\ntheir cheapest - run 4.800 dollars\nannually.\nAnd it is the developing world -especially Africa - that has been\nhardest hit. Sub-Saharan Africa is\nhome to 68 percent of the 22 million\npeople who are HIV positive,\nwith other developing nations home\nto another 22 percent.\nNews of a possible cure offers\nlittle cheer in the developing world,\nwhich has called for the development\nof a vaccine. Researchers offered\nlittle hope, saying that too little\nwas known about HIV and its\nmany subtypes to develop a vaccine\nto protect against it.\nDespite the optimism, the drumbeat\nof the conference was the need\nfor prevention: condom use, fewer sexual partners and the development\nof methods such as microbicides\nthat women can use without\ntheir partners' knowledge.\n\"Will people everywhere be less\ncareful if they believe that the elusive\n'cure' is just around the corner?\"\nsaid Mr David Cooper, president\nof the International Aids\nSociety and a keynote speaker at\nthe Vancouver conference.\n\"Will governments seize on a\ncomfortable but mistaken presumption\nof an imminent end to the epidemic\nto go cold on continued\nfunding?\" he said. The next conference\nis in Geneva in 1998. (AFP)\nDoctors worry that\ntreatment could\nbackfire on society\nVANCOUVER, Friday\nDrug ,treatments offering new hope in the fight against Aids could backfire horribly if they are used\nimproperly, creating fresh and dangerous\nstrains of the virus they were\nmeant to kill.\nParticipants at this week's l1th\nInternational Conference on Aids\nsaid the triple drug \"cocktails\" -\nwhich can require patients to take\nnumerous pills several times a day -\nmay be both too expensive and too\ncomplex for key Aids risk groups\nsuch as drug abusers and homeless\npeople.\n, \"It goes without saying that if\nyou don't know where your next\nmeal is coming from, taking your\nnext pill becomes very secondary, \"\nsaid Dr Mervyn Silverman, former\nhead of the American Foundation\nfor Aids Research.\nThe new therapies, which in\nsome initial studies have cut HIV to\nbelow detectable levels in patients'\nblood, have created a mood of optimism\nin Vancouver, with specialists\nsaying Aids may now be conpared a treatable disease.\nBut what frightens the medical\ncommunity now is that sporadic or\nincomplete attempts at this kind of\ndrug therapy could quickly turn the\npromise of the new \"cocktails\"\ninto a curse, creating a new version\nof the Aids virus invulnerable to\ntreatment.\n\"Are we going to see the emergence\nof a multi-drug resistant virus\nand go back to where we were in\nthe 1980s where we had to just\nwring our hands because we could\ndo nothing?\" asked Dr Marcus Conant, head of the Conant Medical\nGroup, a private clinic for HIV\ntreatment in San Francisco.\n\"You take a group of people,\nmany of whom have never held\ndown a job, have probably never\nfinished school because they are\nnot compulsive enough to get up at\na certain time every morning and\nyou expect them to follow this kind\nof complex drug regimen?\" he\nasked.\nEven a short lapse in drug treatment\ncan allow the viral fire, which\ncan now be doused by drug treatment,\nto rage anew, researchers say.\nAnd the new versions of the virus\nproduced could mutate and become\ninvulnerable to multi-drug therapy.\nThis resistant strain is likely to be\ntransmissable from one HIV sufferer\nto another - creating a new public\nhealth nightmare.\nThere are studies which show\nthat HIV resistant to AZT, the main\ndrug so far perscribed for Aids, can\nbe passed between people and researchers\nbelieve it is very likely\nthat a strain resistant to the new\ntherapy could be transmissable as\nwell.\nBecause the much-touted drug\ncocktails, that involve AZT, the\ndrug 3TC and a protease inhibitor,\nmake sufferers feel better very\nquickly, the less-disciplined are\nlikely to regard further treatment as\nunnecessary .\n\"The anecdotal stories are incredible\n(about the drugs' impact)-\npeople getting out of the grave and\nworking out,\" said Mr Silverman.\nSome specialists say the new therapies\nbe accompanied. (Reuter)\n\nResearchers reveal key\nHIV protein section\nWASHINGTON, Friday\nresearchers have revealed the\n'egg-like\" structure enclosing the\ngenetic material of the human immunodeficiency\nvirus (HIV), potentially an important step to developing\nan Aids-fighting drug, the\njournal Science reported yesterday.\n\"Any scientist who wants to develop\na new drug that interferes\nwith HIV needs to know what the\nvirus looks like, and we've provided the first look at one of HIV's\nclosely held secrets,\" Professor\nMichael Summers, a biochemistry\nprofessor at the University of\nMaryland-Baltimore County, said\nin a statement.\nCapping six years of work, Prof\nSummers and other researchers at\nthe University of Maryland-Baltimore\nCounty and the University of Utah in the July 12 edition of the journal gave a detailed molecular\npicture of a piece of the shell that\nholds HIV-I enzymes needed for\nthe virus to infect and reproduce.\nThe structure of the protein that\nbinds with identical proteins to\nmake up the shell is unlike any others\npreviously seen, they said.\nCalled the p24 capsid protein, it\nhas a single, exposed loop that contains\nan amino acid called Pr090\nthat binds to a protein called cyclophilin\nA in a process that researchers\nsaid appears to be necessary for\na viral particle to become infectious.\nIn an interview, Prof Summers\ndescribed the capsid protein as a\npiece of a soccer ball that binds\nwith other identical pieces. Prof\nSummers added that the researchers\nwere satisfied. (Reuter)"}
