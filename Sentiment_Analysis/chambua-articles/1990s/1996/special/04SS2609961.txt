Warning to UK tourism timely 

The British Government deserves
praise for its ·recent efforts to maintain
a clean image abroad.
This- is particularly so considering
its timely action to crack down
on tourists soiling Britain's name "my misbehaviour while overseas.
It has been become common
these days, for some of these tourists
who are a real nuisance, to flock
abroad, especially in the so-called
Third World countries not to view
the scenery and the wild animals or
to enjoy. the hot climates. They
leave Britain with their minds made
up about seeking sexual escapades .
'with young children in the. host
countries.
The British Government's clear
warning that the tourists who go to
the Third World and engage in
these kinds of acts will be prosecuted
once the return home is welcome
. indeed.
It is' a good example which other
countries whose national engaged
in similar uncouth tourism should
emulate.
It is high time countries such as
the United States, Japan, South Korea
and others introduced similar
measures against their nationals
travelling abroad.
Should these countries, which
are a major source of the tourism
traffic to the developing world, initiate similar, measures, they will go
among way in helping to curb the
spread of Aids and the traditional
sexually-transmitted diseases.
Though HIV-Aids has been
spread in the West mainly through
homosexuality, the evidence· ·in
Africa and elsewhere shows that it
can also be passed on through hetero-sexual contact.
These tourists exploit young innocent
boys and girls by exposing
them to money and drugs. These
.end up dropping out of school.
Many take to the streets where they
keep pursuing the tourists.
In Nairobi and Mombasa, there
are many such girls who can be
seen openly haggling with their
tourist clients. The British decision
is a step in the right direction. Bravo
Britain!

Aids Motion inadequate
Though we appreciate the concern
of the Members of Parliament
about the need to curb the
spread of HIV/Aids, their voting
for a life sentence for HIV rapists
and deliberate infectors, still
leaves a loophole that must be examined
and sealed.
The implication of the Motion,
which was debated recently and
passed in Parliament, is that
people will be avoiding HIV tests
(which is voluntary) lest they rape
or infect others in future.
Though this is a technical way
of avoiding the life sentence, it is
deliberate ignorance of one's HIV
status.
.. .Another possibility may be silent but accelerated' spread of the
virus .that causes this deadly
disease.
The Motion has also an in-built
discrimination of those who have
tested positive and which is a violation
of their human rights.
I fully support Mr Allan Ragis
of Aids Consortium, who questioned
whether a life sentence was
the only viable weapon for fighting
the spread of Aids ..
What Kenyans need is behavioral
change and some sort of
moral cleansing.
And Kenyans should always
remember is that everyone is positive
until proved otherwise.
Though the Motion was well intended
and geared towards the
right direction in the effort to fight
Aids, I still. feel that it was lopsided and not as all-embracing as
should have been the case.
It required public consultation
for all the issues involved to be
thrashed out before the MPs could
take it to Parliament for their discussions.
'This way, the people would
have contributed to this vital debate
by their representatives
