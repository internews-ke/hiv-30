{"text": "Good news from doctors\nVANCOUVER, Tuesday\nAids researchers presented solid\nevidence yesterday that the disease\n'has killed nearly six million\npie may now be treatable thanks\nto \"cocktails\" of experimental\ndrugs.\nSpeakers at the 11th International\nConference on Aids drew cheers\nand applause from nearly 15,000\ndelegates as they summed up recent\nbreakthroughs in combination drug\ntreatments, which for the first time\noffer hope that Aids may no longer\nbe a death sentence.\nBut militant protesters, venting\nthe angry frustration that has\nmarked so much of the battle\nagainst Aids, quickly accused drug\nfirms of profiteering with expensive\ndrugs that may never reach\nmost of the people infected with the\nvirus.\nThe doctors, however, remain e\ncautiously upbeat.\nThe new drug mixes \"have\ntaught us a lot about treatment ...\nand hope for the future,\" said Dr.\nScott Hammer, head of the department\nof infectious diseases at Boston's\nDeaconess Hospital and Harvard\nMedical School.\n\"Access and cost are major obstacles\nto the Third World. But\nthere is hope for more and more results in the years to come and for control of the HIV virus.\"\nThe excitement centres on startling\nresults achieved by combining\nnew drugs, called protease inhibitors,\nwith more traditional anti\nAids treatments such as AZT and\nother drugs.\nScientists are now voicing hope\nthese cocktails will batter the resilient\nhuman immunodeficiency virus\ninto submission, perhaps eve eradicating it from the bodies of patients\nnow condemned to die.\n\"Just six months ago, this statement\nwould have been seen as faro'\nfetched or even ludicrous,\" said Dr\nHammer.\nPotent drug combinations including\nprotease inhibitors, which\nattack an enzyme crucial to the\nmultiplication of HIV, have already\nreduced the virus to undetectable\nlevels -in some patients, raised\ncounts of CD-4 immune cells, and\ndramatically improved their health,\nappearance and quality of life.\nDespite the advances being trumpeted\nat the conference, there is still\ndeep caution in dealing with a virus\nthat is a moving target. Until recently,\nit has outsmarted researchers by\nmutating - transforming itself into\ndifferent strains - and building\nswift resistance to drug therapies. Dr Hammer, and many other scientists,\nstressed that the new drugs\nwere promising but left many questions\nunanswered.\n\"The jury's still out,\" said Dr\nMichelle Daniels, a general practitioner\nfrom Princeton, New Jersey,\nwho treats Aids patients.\nAdvocates of the new drug therapy\nare leaning toward using the protease combinations in large doses in\nthe early stages of treatment to cut\nthe risk the virus will build resistance.\nDr Robert Gallo, a pioneer of\nAids research, summed up the approach\nto new combination drug\ntherapy by saying: \"HIV replication\ncauses Aids. Kill early and kill\nit hard.\" Drug mixes including protease\ninhibitors can cost around\n$15,000 (Sh859,350) a year in the\nUnited States. They are thus out of reach of patients\nin the Third World, where the\nUnited Nations estimates 90 percent\nof the world's 21.8 million\nHIV-infected people live.\nThe only course in Africa and\nAsia is preventive medicine and the\nhope, one day, of a vaccine. But a\nvaccine is still a long way off.\nMilitant anti-Aids demonstrators\nyesterday targeted Abbott Laboratories, one of the companies manufacturing\nan expensive new. drug.\nProtesters descended on an Abbott\ndisplay booth, tossed pharmaceutical literature onto the floor and\nchanted slogans accusing the company\nof profiteering.\nDr William Paul, Director of the\nUS Office for Aids Research said:\n\"Even if these drugs turn out to be\neverything we had hoped for, a tremendous amount must still be done\nto make sure those who need treatment are treated.\"\nCountries like the US should\nhelp Africa and Asia if only because\nthey were members of the\nworld community. But self-interest\nwas also involved, he noted. \"We\ncannot predict how the virus will\nevolve,\" he said.

A preliminary study on a group\nof monkeys found that monkeys\ntaking the hormone had a thinner\nvaginal wall, but Dr Fontanet\nwarned that the same results may\nnot be found in humans.\nMeanwhile, a triple combination\nof Abbott Laboratori'es Inc.'s Norvir\nand two other drugs has kept the\nAids virus at bay for 60 weeks in a\nclinical trial, the company said yesterday.\n. In an update presented at the\nConference Abbott said 17 patients\nin France with advanced, previously\nuntreated HIV infection were\ngiven Norvir, Glaxo Wellcome\nPic's AZT and Roche Holding\nLtd. 's Hivid. After 60 weeks on the\ntherapy, the count of the patients'\ndisease-fighti.ng CD4 cells rose to a\nmean of 337 from a mean of ]55\ncells, the company said in a statement.\n(Agencies)\nTaylor criticises US\nCanadian policies\nVANCOUVER, Tuesday\nActress and Aids activist Elizabeth \nTaylor bitterly attacked the US and\nCanadian governments yesterday\naccusing Washington of committing\n\"premeditated murder\" in\nfailing to fund Aids programmes.\nShe told a private reception at the\nconference that euphoria over medical\nadvances did little to dispel the\nreality - that most people with\nHIV do not have access to drugs or\nother treatments.\nMs Taylor, one of the first celebrity\nAids campaigners and a\nfounder and National Chairwoman\nof the American Foundation for Aids Research (AmFAR), critised\nUS reluctance to fund programmes\nto provide sterile needles\nto drug users, as is done in some\nEuropean countries, as \"a glaring\nexample of politics.\n\"In a society that proclaims to\nvalue human life above all, the deliberate\nwithholding of the means\nto self-protection is more than passive\nneglect. It is a measured act of\npremeditated murder.\"\nMs Taylor told the audience.\nwhich included US Health Secretary\nDonna Shalala. that too much\nemphasis was being placed on\npurely scientific research.(Reuter)\n\nRare move\nby drug firm\nVANCOUVER, Tuesday\nStung by accusations that drug\ncompanies are making billions at\nthe expense of Aids victims, Glaxo-\nWellcome Pic said yesterday it was\nStarting to pay the community back.\nIt invited Aids activists, researchers\nmid community workers\nattending the conference to a\u00b7 special\nlunch to hear about its \"positive\naction programme\" to work\nwith Aids groups, governments and\n, health care providers. \"We, the private\nsector, the phannaceutical industry, have to recognize our responsibility,\"\nMr Jim Niedel,\nexecutive director for research and\ndevelopment at Glaxo, said.(Reuter)"}
