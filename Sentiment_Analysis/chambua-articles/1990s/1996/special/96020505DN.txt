{"text": "Sex workers still HIV-resistant\nLate last year, a newspaper article on HIV resistance\namong sex workers in Nairobi, generated a\nlot of interest. Reactions to the finding were published\nin the letters to the. editor forum. Since\nthen, I have received many telephone calls at the\nresearch clinic of the University of Nairobi from\nmembers of the public wanting to know more\nabout this issue.\nWe have established that many people still\ndoubt the HIV resistance claim among the Majengo\ncommercial sex workers. We, therefore,\nfeel there is need to give the public more information.\nThe research at our clinic is a joint venture between\nthe University of Nairobi, several foreign\nuniversities, and the Commercial Sex Workers\ninvolved. It was established to study the patterns\nof sexually-transmitted diseases and how they\nrelate to HIV and Aids. We also offer quality\nSTDs treatment, HIV and Aids opportunistic infections\nmanagement and promote condom use.\nThe research has been going on for the past 11\nyears and the issue of HIV resistance is one among many observations at the clinic. To the women, the clinic also acts as a club house where\nthey get the latest information on STDs, HIV and\nAidSs, condoms, attention for their medical complaints\nand counselling. They also hold meetings\non their general welfare or on methods of negotiating\nsafer sex with their clients. This interaction\nhelps us to monitor their disease progression and\nto learn how to assist to cope with their problems.\nThey are not \"used as research materials\"\nas sever!!l callers thought. .\nAbout 40 out of 2,000 women who have been\nfollowed for more than seven years and who\n\"ought\" to have contracted the virus due to their\noccupation remained disease free. Since they do\nget other STDs from their work and they do not\nchoose their sex clients (average six, condom use\n70 per cent, HIV seroprevalence among STDs\ntransmitters core groups' >30 per cent), then it\nwas demonstrated that this could not be by\nchance.\nThese sex workers have been found to be HIV negative by any test currently known. However, this conclusion was reached from their level of natural exposure. Nobody innoculated them with the HIV virus as some people may have thought.\nCurrently, high-level research focusing on this\nissue is being carried out and abroad. Preliminary\ndata suggests that the women could have\nwhite blood cells (lymphocytes) that clear or kill\nany HIV virus contracted. That clearing or killing\nfactor has not been isolated.\nSeveral people have called the clinic asking to\nbe transfused with blood from these women.\nMost of the callers seem to have done their home\nwork and have challenged points and observations.\nStudies are being carried out to answer this\nquestion.\nOur research is published in major local and\ninternational medical journals and presented at\ninternational conferences. We are ready to assist\nthe public to get up to date information on HIV\nmanagement.\nDr Joshua Kimani.\nSTD/HIV Project.\nNairobi University"}
