{"text": "Warning to UK tourism timely \n\nThe British Government deserves\npraise for its \u00b7recent efforts to maintain\na clean image abroad.\nThis- is particularly so considering\nits timely action to crack down\non tourists soiling Britain's name \"my misbehaviour while overseas.\nIt has been become common\nthese days, for some of these tourists\nwho are a real nuisance, to flock\nabroad, especially in the so-called\nThird World countries not to view\nthe scenery and the wild animals or\nto enjoy. the hot climates. They\nleave Britain with their minds made\nup about seeking sexual escapades .\n'with young children in the. host\ncountries.\nThe British Government's clear\nwarning that the tourists who go to\nthe Third World and engage in\nthese kinds of acts will be prosecuted\nonce the return home is welcome\n. indeed.\nIt is' a good example which other\ncountries whose national engaged\nin similar uncouth tourism should\nemulate.\nIt is high time countries such as\nthe United States, Japan, South Korea\nand others introduced similar\nmeasures against their nationals\ntravelling abroad.\nShould these countries, which\nare a major source of the tourism\ntraffic to the developing world, initiate similar, measures, they will go\namong way in helping to curb the\nspread of Aids and the traditional\nsexually-transmitted diseases.\nThough HIV-Aids has been\nspread in the West mainly through\nhomosexuality, the evidence\u00b7 \u00b7in\nAfrica and elsewhere shows that it\ncan also be passed on through hetero-sexual contact.\nThese tourists exploit young innocent\nboys and girls by exposing\nthem to money and drugs. These\n.end up dropping out of school.\nMany take to the streets where they\nkeep pursuing the tourists.\nIn Nairobi and Mombasa, there\nare many such girls who can be\nseen openly haggling with their\ntourist clients. The British decision\nis a step in the right direction. Bravo\nBritain!\nConcerned Kenyan.\nKitale.\nAids Motion inadequate\nThough we appreciate the concern\nof the Members of Parliament\nabout the need to curb the\nspread of HIV/Aids, their voting\nfor a life sentence for HIV rapists\nand deliberate infectors, still\nleaves a loophole that must be examined\nand sealed.\nThe implication of the Motion,\nwhich was debated recently and\npassed in Parliament, is that\npeople will be avoiding HIV tests\n(which is voluntary) lest they rape\nor infect others in future.\nThough this is a technical way\nof avoiding the life sentence, it is\ndeliberate ignorance of one's HIV\nstatus.\n.. .Another possibility may be silent but accelerated' spread of the\nvirus .that causes this deadly\ndisease.\nThe Motion has also an in-built\ndiscrimination of those who have\ntested positive and which is a violation\nof their human rights.\nI fully support Mr Allan Ragis\nof Aids Consortium, who questioned\nwhether a life sentence was\nthe only viable weapon for fighting\nthe spread of Aids ..\nWhat Kenyans need is behavioral\nchange and some sort of\nmoral cleansing.\nAnd Kenyans should always\nremember is that everyone is positive\nuntil proved otherwise.\nThough the Motion was well intended\nand geared towards the\nright direction in the effort to fight\nAids, I still. feel that it was lopsided and not as all-embracing as\nshould have been the case.\nIt required public consultation\nfor all the issues involved to be\nthrashed out before the MPs could\ntake it to Parliament for their discussions.\n'This way, the people would\nhave contributed to this vital debate\nby their representatives\n.
