Aids conference ends with hope
VANCOUVER, Friday
Aids researchers, activists, doctors,
condom and drug manufacturers
opened up the 11th International
on Aids yesterday amid
the next big target in Aids research.
The closure of the conference,
the most upbeat in years, was interrupted
by a polite protest from ACT
UP, chanting, "Where's
Dingwall?"
A man who is HIV positive took
the stage criticizing Canadian
Health Minister Mr David Dingwall
who had left the conference
with the flu, sending a sarcastic note and flowers.
The activist also had suntan oil
for Prime Minister Jean Chretien,
who is on vacation and did not attend.
Conference organizers tolerated
limited protests aimed at government
officials and drug companies,
which activists have accused of indifference
and greed.
Research news from the conference
was dominated by an obscure
new class of drugs called protease
inhibitors which bind to the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that
causes Aids and prevent it from reproducing. These, used in various combinations,
have been shown to slash the
amount of HIV in the blood but
have only been tested in small
groups of people for no longer than
two years.
"We're seeing a very dramatic
anti-retroviral effect," said Dr David
Ho, director of the Aaron Diamond
Aids Research Center in New
York and one of the research stars
of this conference.
The next big target could be the
mechanism HIV virus uses to stick
to and penetrate the healthy cell.
said researcher Mr Nathanial Landau
of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in a study released yesterday.
Little has been known about how
HIV access healthy cells. and Mr
Landau found that it entered
through a gateway named chemokine
receptor 5, pointing to another
viable area of clinical research.
But, as was often pointed out in
the conference, developing nations
unwilling or unable to ensure safe
drinking water to their poorest residents
will never be able to afford
the new protease inhibitors that - at
their cheapest - run 4.800 dollars
annually.
And it is the developing world -especially Africa - that has been
hardest hit. Sub-Saharan Africa is
home to 68 percent of the 22 million
people who are HIV positive,
with other developing nations home
to another 22 percent.
News of a possible cure offers
little cheer in the developing world,
which has called for the development
of a vaccine. Researchers offered
little hope, saying that too little
was known about HIV and its
many subtypes to develop a vaccine
to protect against it.
Despite the optimism, the drumbeat
of the conference was the need
for prevention: condom use, fewer sexual partners and the development
of methods such as microbicides
that women can use without
their partners' knowledge.
"Will people everywhere be less
careful if they believe that the elusive
'cure' is just around the corner?"
said Mr David Cooper, president
of the International Aids
Society and a keynote speaker at
the Vancouver conference.
"Will governments seize on a
comfortable but mistaken presumption
of an imminent end to the epidemic
to go cold on continued
funding?" he said. The next conference
is in Geneva in 1998. (AFP)
Doctors worry that
treatment could
backfire on society
VANCOUVER, Friday
Drug ,treatments offering new hope in the fight against Aids could backfire horribly if they are used
improperly, creating fresh and dangerous
strains of the virus they were
meant to kill.
Participants at this week's l1th
International Conference on Aids
said the triple drug "cocktails" -
which can require patients to take
numerous pills several times a day -
may be both too expensive and too
complex for key Aids risk groups
such as drug abusers and homeless
people.
, "It goes without saying that if
you don't know where your next
meal is coming from, taking your
next pill becomes very secondary, "
said Dr Mervyn Silverman, former
head of the American Foundation
for Aids Research.
The new therapies, which in
some initial studies have cut HIV to
below detectable levels in patients'
blood, have created a mood of optimism
in Vancouver, with specialists
saying Aids may now be conpared a treatable disease.
But what frightens the medical
community now is that sporadic or
incomplete attempts at this kind of
drug therapy could quickly turn the
promise of the new "cocktails"
into a curse, creating a new version
of the Aids virus invulnerable to
treatment.
"Are we going to see the emergence
of a multi-drug resistant virus
and go back to where we were in
the 1980s where we had to just
wring our hands because we could
do nothing?" asked Dr Marcus Conant, head of the Conant Medical
Group, a private clinic for HIV
treatment in San Francisco.
"You take a group of people,
many of whom have never held
down a job, have probably never
finished school because they are
not compulsive enough to get up at
a certain time every morning and
you expect them to follow this kind
of complex drug regimen?" he
asked.
Even a short lapse in drug treatment
can allow the viral fire, which
can now be doused by drug treatment,
to rage anew, researchers say.
And the new versions of the virus
produced could mutate and become
invulnerable to multi-drug therapy.
This resistant strain is likely to be
transmissable from one HIV sufferer
to another - creating a new public
health nightmare.
There are studies which show
that HIV resistant to AZT, the main
drug so far perscribed for Aids, can
be passed between people and researchers
believe it is very likely
that a strain resistant to the new
therapy could be transmissable as
well.
Because the much-touted drug
cocktails, that involve AZT, the
drug 3TC and a protease inhibitor,
make sufferers feel better very
quickly, the less-disciplined are
likely to regard further treatment as
unnecessary .
"The anecdotal stories are incredible
(about the drugs' impact)-
people getting out of the grave and
working out," said Mr Silverman.
Some specialists say the new therapies
be accompanied. (Reuter)

Researchers reveal key
HIV protein section
WASHINGTON, Friday
researchers have revealed the
'egg-like" structure enclosing the
genetic material of the human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV), potentially an important step to developing
an Aids-fighting drug, the
journal Science reported yesterday.
"Any scientist who wants to develop
a new drug that interferes
with HIV needs to know what the
virus looks like, and we've provided the first look at one of HIV's
closely held secrets," Professor
Michael Summers, a biochemistry
professor at the University of
Maryland-Baltimore County, said
in a statement.
Capping six years of work, Prof
Summers and other researchers at
the University of Maryland-Baltimore
County and the University of Utah in the July 12 edition of the journal gave a detailed molecular
picture of a piece of the shell that
holds HIV-I enzymes needed for
the virus to infect and reproduce.
The structure of the protein that
binds with identical proteins to
make up the shell is unlike any others
previously seen, they said.
Called the p24 capsid protein, it
has a single, exposed loop that contains
an amino acid called Pr090
that binds to a protein called cyclophilin
A in a process that researchers
said appears to be necessary for
a viral particle to become infectious.
In an interview, Prof Summers
described the capsid protein as a
piece of a soccer ball that binds
with other identical pieces. Prof
Summers added that the researchers
were satisfied. (Reuter)
