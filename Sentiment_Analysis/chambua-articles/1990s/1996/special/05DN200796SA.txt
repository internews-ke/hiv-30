Naivasha leads in Aids, says report
By NATION Reporter
Naivasha Division, Nakuru District,
leads in the number of Aids
cases nationwide, a report says.
The Lake Naivasha Basin STI/HIV/Aids Project states in its five page
findings that out of 200 blood
samples screened in the past year, 50 tested HIV-positive.
The report, presented to the district medical
boss, Dr Stanley Soniya,
further says that out of 200
others screened, 48 were confirmed
HIV-positive.
The report is a culmination of research
conducted by six medical
doctors and a counsellor, who targeted
antenatal care patients and
voluntary blood donors.
The report was presented at Nakuru's Hotel Waterbuck by Dr George Galiri during a meeting of
public health officers to bid farewell
to Dr Sonoiya, who is going to
he UK for further studies.
The meeting also used the opportunity
to lay strategies for participating
in national campaigns to
eliminate polio.
According to the research findings,
the migratory workers around
the lake area, who work on flower
farms and fish, "do not stay with
their families, which puts them at
high risk".
Dr Gatiri said: "Some of the
workers on the flower farms come
from Western Kenya, having left
their wives home and are forced to
find commercial [sex] workers to
keep them company."
