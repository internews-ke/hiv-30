Pharmacists disown Obel
Govt warns over unregistered drugs
By LILIAN NDUTA
and BENSON ABELE
The .controversial Aids drug Pearl
Omega will be officially registered
on Monday, its researcher, Prof Arthur
Obel, said yesterday.
Prof Obel, who was answering
questions at Kenyatta University,
where he delivered a lecture on advances
in Aids research, parried a
question on whether he had followed the stipulated procedure in having the drug registered.
. He accused the World Health Organisation
of harbouring "a hidden
agenda by pledging to supply Kenya's HIV positive pregnant women
with AZT, while they knew it
had serious side-effects.
"Is it not an insult for WHO
technocrats to visit our country and
promise us AZTÂ· while we know
that those who use this treatment
die within 18 months, not because
of Aids-related diseases but due to
severe bone marrow depression"
he asked. '
He claimed that all condoms exported
to Third World countries were laced with the Aids virus, "As I travelled around the world, I took
samples of condoms marked for export
to Africa and other developing
'countries and did tests on them and
found they were all laced with the
virus," he said.
The discussion was chaired by
the Vice-Chancellor, Prof George
Eshiwani and Prof James Waithaka,
Prof F.M. Muthuri, Prof K.
Wambari and Prof Jude J. Ongonga
took part. Prof Obel defended his silence
on the composition of his drug, saying
he would not disclose its' formula
for fear that "intellectual property
thieves" would steal it.
He said he did not embark on research
for commercial gain but was
inspired by a desire to find a cure
after his first Aids patient died in
1984.
"My primary aim was to get an
agent which would destroy the
cause of the disease without destroying the host," he told the
cheering students .
The professor said he was giving
out the drug for free to needy Kenyans, He had given 25 cartons to
Moi University,
In Mombasa, the Pharmaceutical
Society of Kenya yesterday disowned
Prof Obel over his claim that
Pearl Omega was a genuine cure for
Aids.
, The Secretary, Dr Rogers Abete.
said it was illegal for anyone to advertise
unregistered drugs.
