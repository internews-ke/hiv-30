{"text": "Aids seems to be a racial weapon\nIt is saddening to imagine that Aids\nand Ebola are weapons in a germ\nwarfare triggered by white men\nagainst the black race and social deviants\nin their society.\n-According to a recent report in a\nlocal daily, a German research doctor,\nProf Wolff Geisler, said Aids\n\"is an artificially manufactured\ndisease whose HIV virus was introduced\ninto Africa in the sixties\".\nHe argues further: \"Ninety seven\nper cent of all the people with HIV\ntoday were infected with the virus\nin the sixties and seventies when\nbeing vaccinated against TB, small\npox and measles,\" and that only\nthree per cent got it through sexual\ntransmission. \"This can be proved\nby age of the majority of the victims,\"\nhe says..\nIt is believed that the virus was\nactivated to infect human beings by\nGerman research scientists in 1908\nand the Americans and the French\ntook the cue after the Second World\nWar.\nOther researchers who share the\nsame view include Prof Ssali, a\nUgandan research scientist and Dr\nJack Felder, a black American research\nscientist. Dr Felder contends\nthat Ebola is also part of a white\nman's germ warfare against the blacks which he predicts will strike\nAfrica every six to twelve months.\nWhen ,these diseases struck\nAfrica for the first time. the Western\nresearchers were apt to link\nthem with viruses carried by monkeys\nand baboons. The connotation\nhere, of course. is that blacks are\nnot far away from these animals,\nThis also is to divert the attention of\nserious researchers into believing\nthat this is an African disease. A\nclose look at the way the Western\nMedia have been handling the news\nabout the spread of Aids in sub-Saharan\nAfrica leaves a lot to be desired.\nTheir eyes are trained here as\nif there is an experiment being conducted.\nHowever, it is not surprising that\nany slight innovation from a Third\nWorld country of any medicine believed\nto cure Aids, is quickly dismissed\nas a hoax with no proper research\nto prove it. What happened\nto Kemron and the others?\nIt has also been discovered that\nHIV can stay in a human body for\nup to 90 years. contrary to the 10\nyears that have been talked of.\nMany people have had the virus for\nmore than 10 years.\nJohn Roktock.\nNakuru"}
