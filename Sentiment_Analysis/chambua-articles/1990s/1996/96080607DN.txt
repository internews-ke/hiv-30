{"text": "Why HIV-positive girl is wrong\nLife is short that is why each one of us must cherish it. We all live in our allotted lifespan and will die when it expires ..\nWe all know that we have no \"rehearsal\" bodies and none of us can make any choice. In fact, the only choice we can make is to learn to live our our lives. But unfortunately, we must consider the consequences of our undertakings.\nI fully sympathise with the HIV positive young girl whose letter was published in'. the Nation of Saturday, July 27. She cannot undo what she is tragically going through now. Aids, more often that not, is prematurely fatal.\nNo one has the moral authority to judge, condemn or stigmatise her.\nNone of us is as perfect as God who knows what motivates us to do the things we do or' don't do. The young lady\u00b7 sounded somewhat slighted, from the tone of her letter.\nI would feel that way, too, if I was\nher..but I am not. \nAnd that is why I disagree with her suggestions, Mothers who truly love and care for their daughters should never advise them to carry condoms.\nIf they did, they would be asking their daughters to live a lie. They would be telling their daughters, indirectly, that condoms can never allow the HIV-virus (and others) through. That despite the fact that the average pore. on a condom is\nlarger than a number of the STD causing\nmicrobes.\nThey would be telling their\ndaughters that the tiny sperm cannot\npass through that pore, too.\nThey would be telling their\ndaughters that condoms cannot slip\noff and that they don't tear. One out\nof every three users suffers from\ncondom-failure.\nThese. mothers who \"'love and\ncare\" for their daughters would be\nasking them to place their lives in\nthe hands of condom-manufacturers.\nThey would be asking their\ndaughters to put all their trust in a\npiece of rubber.\nMy mother never told my siblings\nand I about condoms and yet\nshe would readily give her life for\nanyone of us, even now. Is it true\nthat mothers who do not tell their\ndaughters about condoms do not\nlove them?\nParents should never risk their\nchildren's lives for the sake of sexual\npleasure.\t\nDavid Dimba.\nNairobi"}
