{"text": "This is a must reading\nTitle: AIDS AND THE GRASSROOTS\nPublisher: IPELEGENG PUBLISHERS\nYear:1996\nReviewed by PETER KIMANI\nNo worse tragedy has befallen\nmankind in cent times than the\nAids scourge. It has ravaged\nthrough the humanity leaving\npeople in utter devastation.\nThere are permanent scars, too;\nscars that will never heal and\nwhich are reflected and ramified\nby the blank stares of the orphaned\nchildren left without parents\nor relatives.\nEven more scary are the swelling\nfigures of the number infected\npersons which, when projected to\npredict those that will have died\nfrom the malady at the turn of the\ncentury, the situation gets really\nfrightening.\nAs the world observed the International\nAIDS Day early this\nweek, this is the grim reality that\nwas re-enacted again, and published\nreports revealed that medics\nare just about lost hope in controlling\nthis infectious malady.\nDon't mention anything about the\ncure; that might sound like wishful\nthinking.\nIt is against this backdrop that a\nrecently-published book, is likely\nto be received with great enthusiasm\nas it offers new insights about\nAIDS/HIV, and offers new hope\nto people who have lost hope, especially\nin Africa.\nAids And The Grassroots,\npublished by the non-profit organisation, Ipelegeng Publishers, departs\nfrom the traditional rhetoric\noffered by many NGOs and charitable\norganisations fighting Aids,\nand instead, focuses in the utilization of the rarely appreciated traditional\nhealth practitioners in\nAfrica, and asserts that the solution\nto Africa's Aids/HIV problem,\nlies within Africa itself.\nSponsored by the Danish International\nDevelopment Agency\n(Danida), United Nations Educational,\nScientific and Cultural Organization\n(Unesco), and the Nordic School of Public Health\namong others, it consists of research\nfindings by anthropologists\nand public health researchers,\nwho conducted their research\nin African countries such as Botswana,\nUganda, Rwanda and\nTanzania.\nThe authors set out to demystify\nthe malady which is couched in\ncomplicated terminology, and\nurge for measures to be taken to\nfill in the gap that has been created\nby the World Health Organization\n(WHO) and other multinationals,\nwhose policies are too high and\ndistant to be effective on the\npeople at the \"grassroots,\" who\nare supposed to be beneficiaries of\nthe services.\n\"It has become painfully apparent\nthat those organized efforts\nand the development of a super\nand infra-structure for Aids/HIV\nprevention and control has only to\na limited extent become effective\nat the grassroots levels ...,\" writes\t \nGunilla Krantz and Frants Staugard.\nThe authors place blame on the\nWHO for not responding fast\nenough when the first Aids cases\nwere reported in Africa, and when\nthey eventually dragged their feet\nto the continent, they applied the\nwrong method to tackle the\nproblem.\nThey suggest that the situation\nwould be better tackled with more\nunderstanding of the cultures of\nthe peoples involved, and their\nparticipation in the programme.\n\"To invest our hopes for an improvement\nof the current situation\nin the local community's own initiatives\nand efforts may be an expression\nof realism and respect for\nlocal, cultural strength.\" .\nThose strengths, they expound,\nare vested in the deeply cultural\ninstitutions and personalities, who\nenjoy respect and bind the larger\nsocieties in Africa.\nMoreover, they feel that since\nthe scourge has been interpreted\nin Africa to mean a cultural illness\nstemming from an abominable\n(sexual) act, the best people to\nhandle the infected and to create\nawareness, are the traditional\nhealers, birth attendants, diviners \nand seers.\n\"The time when Traditional\nHealth Practitioners were scurrilously\ndismissed as witch doctors\nhas long since passed, because\u00b7 official medicine has encountered\ngreat difficulties in coping with\nhealth problems in Africa and especially\nAids.\" writes Charlotte\nOja and June Jacobsen Steen, who\nconducted a research in Botswana.\nKrantz and Staguard further explain\nthat traditional sex educators\n(aunts and elderly women), and\nbirth attendants, are the ideal\npeople to disseminate information\non AIDS, which they can easily\nincorporate in their routine puberty\nrites and girls' education.\nthe traditional birth attendants\ncome even more handy: \"In their\nrole as informal community leaders\nand guardians of social norms\nand, rules, traditional birth .attendants\ncould be trained to channel\neducational messages to the local\npopulations on HIV/AIDS\nissues.\"\nThe writers oppose setting up\nof orphanages in Africa, saying\nthey lire alien since they never existed\nin traditional societies, but\norphans were easily accommodated\nin the extended family.\nAnother lot that the authors\nconsider important are the women\ngroups, who volunteer to help the\norphans and the elderly because it\nis their traditional role.\nThey suggest that foreign aid\nshould trickle down to these\ngroups to set up income-generating\nprojects, which will in turn\ngive them a strong base, an aspect\nthat they considered as a prerequisite\nif the combat against AIDS is\nto be successful. \"The AIDS\nprogramme has failed to to grasp\nthe role of poverty in the pandemic,\"\nsays David Pitt in another paper.\n\nTHEATRESCENE\nArtistes who have kept Christian theatre alive were last weekend honoured during the Mavuno\nCross Awards ceremony at the\nHilton Hotel, Nairobi .\nThe awards went to nine church\nyouth groups which took Mavuno\n'96 drama festival earlier this year\nat Kenya National Theatre. This\nwas the second such ceremony by\nthe group.\nThe trophy for the most outstanding\nscript went to Kena\nNjoya for his play Karusta performed\nby St Andrews He had, in\nlast year's festival, be n declared\nbest actor in the play Mitumba.\nRunners-up in this category included\nM. Muhia wit godless\nMyths and Winfred Amalemba\nwith Images We Refleet.\nJack Mwangi was declared best\nproducer in the play The Sunshines\nby Skyflyers group. Challenging\nhim for this aw rd was J.\nOmungala with Absolution from\nKAG Buruburu.\nVideos were used replay\nparts of the scenes to justify the\nawards for those who may have\nforgotten the peak moments of the\nfestival last August. The shooting\nof the docu-dramas was however\npoorly done with the grand idea\nbackfiring as the audience did not\nsee they expected.\nThe best director's trophy went\nto R.E Mangula while the best\npresented play award went to A\nHole in the Wall by Parklands\nBaptist.\nThe actor of the year trophy\nwent to K. Okoti of Parklands\nBaptist while Irene Mugure took\nthe actress of the year award.\nIrene, '15, has twice been\ncrowned the same title in a month.\nShe won the first during the World\nAids Drama Festival held at the\nKenya Polytechnic.\nA University of Nairobi student,\nMoses Mani, presented a\nthrilling oral narrative entitled\nRedemption which was a\n'sheng' dialect. Christine Njogu\ndramatised a mime The Cross for\nthe audience.\nHowever, it was unclear why\nPambazuka Afrika which did\nnot take part in the August Festival\nwas awarded two main trophies\ndespite the group not being\nin the event's programme."}
