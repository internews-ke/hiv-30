{"text": "'Vampire' rapists deserve the noose\nA rapist is a .beast, in fact, a monster. And a person who knows that he is infected with Aids, but proceeds to rape is a veritable vampire and must forever be isolated from the rest of society.\nWhen such a beast rapes and defiles a minor, the maximum penalty allowed in law must be imposed.\nRapists impose their will, their brute force and strength on their innocent and defenceless victims. They traumatise these victims, Young victims have to live with this trauma throughout their adult life. In some cases, this experience has been known to shape and sharpen the victim's world-view, often in a negative manner.\nBut a man who knows he is HIV positive, and goes ahead to impose his will against a woman or child, is a most malicious, indeed evil beast who has, in fact, condemned an innocent woman or child to death. A person who does this can only be imbued with the malicious desire to 'spread the disease and thereby spread the misery.\nTherefore, it is incumbent upon Parliament to move to protect innocent members of the public through the enactment of laws that will deter Aids carriers who may want - to use a common vernacular expression - \"to die with others\" from carrying out their schemes. Such people must die alone.\nOne way to deter such people from coercing others into dying with them is to introduce even stiffer sentences for rapists, particularly those found to be Aids carriers. It is because of this that we give cautious welcome to a motion listed for discussion in Parliament which seeks the death sentence for HIV \u2013positive rapists.\nIt is a private Members motion, which means that even if it is passed, it might not get into the statute books for a long time.\nHowever, we are certain that it is a motion that will elicit a great deal of interest among women activists who have been calling for stiffer sentences to be imposed on rapists.\nBut we are also aware that it will come in for a great deal of criticism, particularly from opponents of the death penalty, and they may be right. Our argument is simply that an Aids-carrier who rapes could inflict the victim with the HIV virus which, in the final analysis, is a death sentence.\nThese rapists must meet the ultimate penalty in law, however that is defined .."}
