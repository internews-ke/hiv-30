{"text": "Delayed birth linked to infant HIV\nA study suggests that if too much time\nelapses between the release of amniotic fluid\nand the birth of a child in a woman infected with HIV, the baby risks becoming infected with the virus that causes Aids ..\nDr Sheldon Handesman of the State,University\nof New York Health Science Centre\nat Brooklyn and 'his colleagues found that\nthe risk of contracting HIV - human immunodeficiency\nvirus - nearly doubles if\nbirth occurs more than four hours after the\nprotective sheath of amniotic fluid has\nruptured.\nThe findings published in the New En\u00b7\ngland Journal of Medicine may discourage\ndoctors from breaking the sheath to speed\nlabour or placing an electrode on the baby's\nscalp to monitor the infant. The research, an analysis of 525 bir.ths\nfrom women infected with HIV, found that\nthe longer the baby remained unsheathed in\nthe womb, the greater the risk of virus\ntransmission. Infection risk rose from\nabout 17 per cent after four hours to roughly\n45 per cent after 40 hours.\nOn one level, the findings were not surprising.\nDoctors have long realised the risk\nof infection becomes greater after the\nsheath breaks, which is why many obstetricians prefer to induce labour chemically or\nperform a caesarean section if the baby has\nnot started emerging 24 hours after the\nsheath has ruptured.\nIt is unclear how doctors will be able to\ntake advantage of the new results\", Pregnant ,women with HIV infection typically get the anti-Aids drug zidovudine, also known as AZT, to reduce transmission'\nchances.\n\"There is no evidence at present that'\ntransmission could be reduced further by\ncombining the administration of zidovudine with a shortening of the duration of\nruptured membranes,\" the team said.\nDoctors could perform a caesarean section\nto hasten delivery but that requires major\nsurgery and a woman infected with HIV\ncould face a higher risk of serious illness if\nher immune system is hobbled and she develops an infection. Tests are already underway\nin Europe to see whether delivering\na baby by C-section reduces the likelihood\nthat the child will be infected with HIV.\n- Reuters"}
