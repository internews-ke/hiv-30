{"text": "Aids: Condoms the best option\nI feel compelled to contribute to the\ndebate on the youth and Aids, and I\nhave a, message for our leaders:\nYour many calls for abstinence will\nnot work, in fact, they cannot work.\nThe burning of condoms and literature,\nas witnessed at Uhuru Park\nnot long ago, will not solve the\nproblem, either; it is a way of running\naway from the problem.\nCurrent statistics show that more\nthan a million Kenyans carry the\nHIV virus. It is common knowledge\nmost are the youth.\nBeing a student and therefore in\nthe' know about what happens in\ncolleges and other learning institutions,\nI find it odd that these leaders,\nboth religious' and political, keep\nharping on the gospel of abstinence.\nThe kind of pornographic material\nthat these students read in magazines\nand watch on video makes the\nsituation all the more grim. The twilight girls who operate in these institutions\nhave a story to tell.\nI therefore insist that the provision\nof condoms and education on'\ntheir safe use is the best solution to\nthis problem. Many will argue that\ncondoms .do not offer 100 per cent\nprotection, but isn't a half-loaf better\nthan none? .\nI have this to tell our leaders:\nYour sons and daughters, too, have\nstrings of girlfriends and boyfriends\nso do not be tempted to sit back,\nthinking it is a problem for \"the\npeople out there\".'They are dying,\nand more will die..\nLet's leave methods doomed to\nfail and take the one and only alternative:\nThe Condom.\nK.W.lbrahim.\nNairobi."}
