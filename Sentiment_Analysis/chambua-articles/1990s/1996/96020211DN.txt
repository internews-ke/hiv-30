{"text": "Blood feud rocks Israel\nBy JEFFREY HELLER                       \nJERUSALEM. Thursday\n\"If you prick us, do we not bleed...And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?\"\nIsraeli health officials might have brushed up on their Shakespeare-namely Shylock the Jew's rage at racism in \"The Merchant of Venice\" -before routine test - disregarding the donated blood of Ethiopian Jews for fear of Aids without telling them. In a fury over perceived discrimination, thousands of black Jews rioted in Jerusalem on Sunday\nin a protest that shook the Jewish state and shattered the stereotype of\nthe subservient Ethiopian immigrant.\"Although our skin is black, our\nblood is as red as yours and we are just as Jewish as you are,\" one\nplacard read. \"We had this image for II years since our massive immigration.\nThey told us: 'You are nice, quiet and polite,'' said Mr Addisu Messele,\na leader of the Ethiopian community.\"Yesterday, the anger and violence were an expression of our pain, a message to' the Israeli public \"he said about the protest out the Prime Minister Shimon Peres's office in which dozens of policemen and demonstrators were injured. About 60,000 Ethiopian Jews live in Israel most arrived in secret airlifts in 1984-85 and 1991, returning to ancient homeland that is now a hi-tech country which prizes skilled Russian immigrants rather than rural Africans.\nHundreds, mostly the elderly, ailing or unemployable, still live in drab caravan camps set up by the government, relief officials say.\nThousands have received state grants and moved into apartments.\nMany at Sunday's protest said they were showing anger bottled up\nfor years over a racism that they had felt in schools, work and the army\nregarded in Israel as the great equalizer among diverse Jewish immigrant communities.\n\"Racism exists, undeniably, but it isn't the whole picture,\" said Ms\nShoshana Ben-Oor, director of the Israel office of the North American\nConference on Ethiopian Jewry, a group involved in the \"rescue and\nrelief' of the black Jews. Instead, she said, ill-will had been sparked by cultural differences and portrayals in the Israeli media, however well-intentioned, of the Ethiopian newcomer\u2019s as poor and downtrodden\".\nMs Ben-Dor said Israelis were initially fascinated by reports the\nblack Jews were new to electricity and gas stoves, but then started\nwondering whether Ethiopians knew how to maintain homes and\nproperty values. \"Exactly many of the factors that made Israelis want to run out and help the Ethiopians when they arrived ...bring about the reaction,\n'Do I want them as my next-door neighbour and in class with my\nkids?'\" she told Reuters.\"If you say they came (to Israel) sick, and many of them did, although with almost nothing incurable...you want to go to help them and visit them in the hospital. But do you want your child attending kindergarten with their children?\"A veteran Ethiopian immigrant,\nMatti' Elias, who came to Israel 40 years ago at the age of 10, said\nhealth officials had further stigmatized the community.\n\"They took all the Ethiopian Jews and defined them as dangerous.\nThat was nonsense,\" he said, referring to the wholesale disposal\nof their donated blood, a measure which the national blood bank continued to defend on Monday.\nMs Ben-Dor said Ethiopians found the policy on blood donations especially insulting.\"Blood for them has a great symbolic significance ...lt symbolizes life in a very, very basic level,\" she said.\nBut she said Mr Peres's public apology to the community over the\nblood bank's failure to disclose untiI a newspaper report appeared\nlast week - that it was spilling the donated blood would help mend relations. The Israeli public, Ms Ben-Dor added, might also see the Ethiopians' protests in a positive light.\n\"I think there was a certain degree of, on the one hand, admiration\nfor them being nice, quiet and polite. \"On the other hand, since this is\na very aggressive society, they were considered to be push-overs,\" she\nsaid.\n\"I think now they will get more respect from the general Israeli society\nfor having banged on the table. In Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian\ngovernment summoned the Israeli ambassador and expressed \"deep\nconcern\" over the treatment of Ethiopian Jews.\nAn official statement said Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin called in Ambassador Abia Gnanot late on Monday and requested further\nclarification on \"the matter that triggered the demonstration.\n\"The minister voiced deep concern over the issue and asked for further clarification on the matter,\" the statement said.\nThe Ethiopia News Agency (ENA) said the Israeli ambassador\nexpressed \"the sadness felt by his government over the incident\".\n\"The ambassador also confirmed that Israel has already started\ntaking action with the view to eliminate the causes underlying the\nincident,\" ENA added. \"How can all blood donated by the Ethiopian Jews become tainted with the HIV virus'? This smacks of racism than anything else,\" said a young man in an Addis Ababa street.\nHIV leads to full-blown Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome\n(Aids) for which a cure has not been discovered.
