{"text": "THURSDAY, MARCH 14,1996\n\nRapid Aids spread in heterosexuals explained\n\nHarvard University researchers\nhave discovered that the particular\ncharacteristics of subtype of the\nIIIV virus, prevalent in Thailand,\nmay explain Aids' rapid spread\namong heterosexuals in Southeast\nAsia,\nIn a study published in a recent\nScience Magazine, scientists from\nthe Harvard Aids Institute in Massachusetts\nfound that the HIV-I E\nsubtype grows much more efficiently\nin the cells that line the female\nvagina than subtypes prevalent\nin the United States and\nelsewhere.\nThat more efficient growth\nmakes it much easier to spread the\nvirus during heterosexual intercourse,\naccording to Max Essex,\nchairman of the institute.\nAids is spreading faster in Asia\nthan anywhere else in the world, according\nto recent data.\nJust last week, Thomas Quinn, a\nresearcher at the US Nationallnstitute\nof Allergy and Infecious Diseases,\nsaid some 3.5 million people\nin Asia are infected with HIV, the\nvirus that causes Aids.\nThe Harvard researchers may\nnow have helped ligure out why it\nis spreading so quickly in the region,\nespecially in Thailand.\nScientists have so far detected\nnine different subtypes of IIIV-I,\ndesignated as A, B, C'. D, E, F, G,\nH, and O. Subtype B is prevalent in\nthe United States and Western\nEurope; while subtypes A, C, and D\npredominate in Africa; subtype C is\nthe dominant strain in India; and\nThailand has both E and B subtypes.\nThere is also a less virulent\nform ofHIV-- HIV-2 -. which is\nprevalent in West Africa.\nThe Harvard scientist found that\nthe subtype. HIV-lB epidemic:\nwhich started among injection drug\nusers in Thailand, has reached a\nplateau at a relatively low level of\nless than 100,000 infections.\nOn the other hand, the E epidemic\nhas exploded among heterosexuals:\nup to one million of whom\nhave been infected.\nThe researchers note that while\nheterosexual intercourse has to date\naccounted for lOpeI' cent or less of\nHIV transmission in the United\nStates and Western Europe, it is responsible\nfor more than 90 per cent\nof HIV transmission in Asia and\nAfrica, according to the report.\nThe discovery could help efforts\nto tind a vaccine, according to\nEssex.\n\"The fact that subtypes have\ndiffferent affinities to different\nkinds of cells is critical to vaccine\ndevelopment, . because vaccines\nseek to block t hose kinds of attachments,\"\nEssex said.\nBut he noted that most vaccine\nprototypes th It have been dS;\nveloped so far have been targeted\nonly at HIV su )types that predominate\nin the United States and\nEurope when: the heterosexual\nspread of Aids has so far much less\nof a problem than its transmission\nthrough tainted intravenous needl&\nand homosexunl intercourse."}
