{"text": "Facts on Aids patients wrong\nI would like to respond to a recent\narticle by Justus Koini in the Daily\nNation entitled HIV rate in\nMara alarming - Doctor.\nAlthough I am happy with the\nheading of the article. I regret the\nfact that some figures are not correct\nand are not in line with the discussion\nI had with Mr Koini. I had an interview with him\nwhere we discussed my interest in\ndeveloping football in the district.\nIn the interview, I made it\nclear that besides football being my\nmajor hobby, I was also interested\nin conveying health  messages about\nHIV/AIDS to the local people.\nI explained that the major means\nof transmitting the virus is through\nsexual intercourse, but there are\nother ways like blood-blood contact\nwhich occurs, for example during\ncircumcision ceremonies where up\nto 10-15 boys or girls are circumcised\nusing the same blade.\nWe know from our Community\nHealth workers that some teenagers\nengage in sexual intercourse before\ncircumcision. I told Mr Koini this\ntradition could contribute to the\nspread of the disease among the\nMaasai and the Kipsigis in Trans\nMara. The number of patients 'testing\npositive HIV is alarming, but\nwriting that 50 per cent of our inpatients\nare suffering from Aids related-\nsicknesses suggests that we\ntest all our patients, which we\ndon't. I quoted this figure from another\narticle in the Nation. \"Fifty\nper cent of in-patients have Aids--\nDMS\".\nI told Mr Koini a figure like that\nwould suggest that about 80 patients\nin our hospital would be HIV\npositive since there are about 160\npatient admitted. However, we only\ntest people we suspect to be suffering\nfrom Aids.\n. I know of only seven Aids patients\nwho had died in the hospital\nby November last year.\nIn an area where we still hear the\npeople talking about Ukimwi\n(Aids) as ugonjwa wa radio (disease\nmyth on radio), I am pleased\nwith your attention towards this\nHIV problem in Trans Mara, but I\nstrongly request that the facts are\ncorrected to avoid fear among our\npatients.\nDR.
