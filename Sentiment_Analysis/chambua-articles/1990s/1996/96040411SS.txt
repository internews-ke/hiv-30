{"text": "April 4, 96\n\nParliament should\nenact an anti-Aids\ntransmission law\nIn this third article on the series on the position of law on Aids/HIV,\nlawyer OTIENDE AMOLLO, argues that while misdemeanours [in\nKenya] are generally punishable with imprisonment for a term not\nexceeding three years or with a fine or both, such is inappropriate in\ncases involving transmission of .Aids.\n\nThe other provision under which\none may be charged is S.186 of the\nPenal Code which provides that:\n\"Any person who unlawfully or\nnegligently does any act which is,\nand which he knows or has reason\nto believe to be, likely to spread the\ninfection of any disease dangerous\nto life is guilty of a misdemeanour.\n\"\nWhereas this section has the advantage\nof addressing even nonsexually\ntransmitted Aids, the sentence\nis inadequate.\nMisdemeanours are generally\n- punishable with imprisonment for a\nterm not exceeding three years or\nwith a fine or both. Such is inappropriate\nin cases involving transmission\nof Aids ...\nOutside the subject of wilful infection\nby the accused, whether it\nprovides a lawful ground of discharge\nthat the accused, charged\nwith a named offence, is Aids infected\nis a moot issue.\nWhether it would justify a reduction\nof his sentence after conviction\nis similarly open to question. One\ntrend that has grown in the Kenyan\nsentencing jurisprudence is the unconditional\ndischarge by magistrates of suspects/accused persons\nlearnt to be Aids sufferers .\nIt is our conviction that such discharge\nhas been without legal basis\nwhatsoever. Nor is the cause of justice tice served by releasing a person accused\nof'rape on grounds of infection\nfor he is likely to endanger\neven more lives. Well grounded\nand supportable would be where a\nprisoner claims re4uction of his/her\nsentence by reason of the later discovery\nthat he is HIV positive.\nYet, even though Aids may provide\nno proper avenue for discharge,\nlike all other ailments, it is a\nproper and strong ground for granting\nbail and courts have in !he past\ngranted bail on the ground of ill\nhealth.\nBeside all the above, Aids raises\nvarious other questions in the context\nof criminal law. One such is\nwhether it amounts to criminal libel\nas defined by the Penal Code (SS '\n194 & 195) - for one to allege that\nanother is infected with the virus.\nS.195 defines defamatory matter as\nmatter likely to injure the reputation\nof any person by exposing him\nto hatred, contempt or ridicule, or\nlikely to damage any person in his\nprofession or trade.\nA certain school of thought has\nrecommended that Euthanasia\n(popularly known as \"mercy killing\")\nbe decriminalised. It has also\nsometimes been urged that prostitution\nshould be criminalised as such\nand not merely circumscribed by illegalities\nas is the position under\nthe Penal Code. (Note that prostitution\nis not an offence, but living off\nthe earnings of the prostitution is).\nIn light of the foregoing, the ambivalent\nnature of Kenya's penal\nlaws vis-a-vis Aids is obviated. Our\nParliament should pass a narrowly\ntailored anti-Aids transmission statute\nthat would impose more serious\ncriminal sanctions in a clearer manner.\nThis would address HIV transmission\nin the criminal context , and\npunish individuals \"who know of\ntheir status and engage in behaviour\nwhich they' know are, according to\nscientific state-of-the-art information,\nlikely to result in transmission\nof HIV.\"\n..The series continue tomorrow\nwhen the writer looks at causes of\naction in law for victims of sexually\ntransmitted diseases."}
