{"text": "Changing lifestyles\naffecting Kenyans'\nlife expectancy\nDo Kenyans today have the same\nchance as earlier generations to\ngrow old before dying?\nMr John Mande, a clothes seller\nfrom Nakuru, says no. \"In the furture\ndays, only old people used to\ndie, but today, many young people\nare dying,\" he said at his kiosk at\nKamukunji Market, Nairobi.\nMr Kamande is not alone in his\nperception that Kenyans are living\nshorter lives. In a recent survey of\nrural inhabitants carried out by Interlink\nRural Information Service\n(IRlS), more than 90 per cent said\nthey believed people were dying\n. younger. Mr Kamande was among\n17 men and 20 women from 22 districts\nthat IRIS researchers interviewed\nin a research facilitated by\nthe national office of the UNDP\nAfrica 2000 Network.\nMore than half of those interviewed\nblamed changing diets and\npoor nutrition for the early deaths.\nMrs V.W. Ikahu, a kiosk owner\nfrom Kirinyaga, said: \"Eating processed\nfood makes the body weaker...\neasier for diseases to attack.\"\nOthers agreed that food today.)Vas\nmore likely to contain chemicals,\nsuch as the pesticides used to grow\nand store crops.\nt\\s more people buy food rather\nthan grow it themselves, they are\nlosing the nutritional values of traditional\nfoods and replacing them\nwith unhealthy quantities of oil,\nsugar and salt, 13 interviewees said.\nMr Stephen Matoka, a stall owner\nfrom Kisii, summed up the view\nthat nutritional habits have changed\nfor the worse: \"People are living\nshorter lives because the modern\ndiet is not healthy.\"\nThe second most common explanation\nwas that diseases were on the\nrise. Some blamed the recurrence of\nfamiliar diseases. Ms Mariam Makbuli\nfrom Kwale District said\npeople were dying of bilharzias and\ndysentery at the Coast because of\nuntreated water. Others said new or\n\"unknown\" diseases were killing\npeople. Six pointed directly to the\nAcquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome\n(Aids).\nOther explanations included road\naccidents, .air pollution, the abandonment\nof traditional medicine,\npoverty, starvation, violent crime,\nwitchcraft and ethnic conflict.\nMany associated these causes to\nbroad cultural trends. Ms Felista\nMungai from Kajiado said:\n\"People are living shorter lives due\nto a change from customary ways\nof living to Western lifestyles.\"\n\u2022\u2022. 'WhiTe the majority of those interviewed\nby I~~ agreed that people\nwere' dying' younger; the general\nconsensus among population researchers\nand practitioners is that life expectancy in Kenya has been\nrising consistently over the past few\ndecades. 'Life expectancy' refers to\nthe average number of years a person\ncan expect to live after the date\nof birth.\nAccording to the World Health\nOrganisation's (WHO) 1995 report,\nKenya: Country Health\nProfile, life expectancy has risen\nfrom age 44 in 1963 to age 60 in\n1993. Prof Zibeon Muganzi, a senior\nlecturer at the University of\nNairobi's Population Studies and\nResearch Institute, backed up these\nstatistics. \"Life expectancy has\nbeen rising gradually due to improvements\nin health consciousness\nand greater availability of food and\nmedicine. \"\nWhat, then, can explain the wide\ndisparity between rural perceptions\nand the research consensus? The\ngrowth in population may be one\nanswer. If there are more people in\nKenya today, then more people will\nbe dying, in terms of numbers. Rural\npeople may simply be attending\n1 more funerals.\nHowever, Prof A.B.C. Acholla\nAyayo, senior lecturer in anthropology\nand population at the University\nof Nairobi, said rural perceptions\nmight reflect recent trends in mortality.\n'Mortality' is the number of\ndeaths compared to the total population.\nAs research findings are often\npublished several years after\ndata is first collected. statistics may\nbe lagging behind.\nProf Acholla suggested three factors\nwhich contribute to a rise In\nmortality rates.\n\"Medical services are deteriorating.\nIn both rural and urban hospitals,\npeople are dying of diseases\nthat could be cured. Hygienic conditions\nare poor, as is the attitude\nand behaviour of the staff. There is\nno medicine and equipment is broken\ndown. Doctors can do nothing\nwith empty hands. \"\nAids is the second factor which\nProf Acholla named. \"People who\nwere infected 10or 15years ago are\nnow beginning to die,\" he said,\nadding that Aids deaths may be\nmore \"obvious\" because the\nscourge was most prevalent among\nyounger people. \"Thirdly, preventive\nmedicine is not taken seriously.\nSixty per cent of mortality is linked\nto hygiene and sanitation which, in\nturn, is linked to water availability.\"\nRecent research hints that these\nthree hypotheses may be accurate.\nThe WHO Profile quoted above,\nfor example, reports that the Ministry\nof Health is struggling to support\nthe large public health infrastructure\nwhich has grown since\nindependence. Although the Profile\ndoes not link hospital conditions\nto mortality rates, it does report that these budget problems\n\"have resulted in the deterioration\nof physical facilities and their basic\nequipment\" .\nResearch on Aids and population\nalso suggests Aids will negatively\naffect life expectancy in Kenya.\nAccording to Aids in Kenya, a report\nfrom three government bodies\n- the National Aids Control\nProgramme, the Ministry of Health\nand the National Council on Population\nand Development - an estimated\n5.7 per cent of Kenya's population\nwas infected with the HIV\nvirus in 1993.\nThe conservative projection is\nthat by the year 2,000, nine per cent\nwill be infected. \"Aids will increase\ndeath rates at all ages, especially\namong young adults (15 to\n49) and under-five children,\" the\nreport says.\nThirdly, the WHO 1994Annual\nReport stated that \"preventable\ncommunicable diseases still dominated\nthe health problems (in\n1994)\". Malaria, acute respiratory\ninfection (ARI) and diarrheal diseases\nwere responsible for 52 per\ncent of total morbidity, that is, the\ntotal amount of illness in the population.\nDr Dominic Mutie, a disease\ncontrol officer at the WHO, acknowledged\nthat while life expectancy\nhad been going up overall, rural\ninterviewees were accurate in\nsome of their perceptions. \"Traditional\nfoods did not have the cholesterol\nof today.\" Dr Mutie said,\nreferring to the fatty substance\nfound in human and animal tissues.\nTaking in high levels of cholesterol\n- found in meat, eggs and dairy\nproducts - may lead to hypertension\n(high blood pressure), arteriosclerosis\n(clogging of the arteries)\nand ultimately heart disease. \"Before,\npeople lived a more relaxed,\nand yet active, life. Today, people\nare more sedentary. Women are\noverworked, even the educated\nones, who return from a day of\nwork to care for their home and\nfamily. Things are changing rapidly.\"\nHe suggested that rural inhabitants\nmay perceive a rise in mortality\nbecause many people, especially\nyoung ones, immigrate to towns\nwhere they are at a higher risk or\nroad accidents, sexually transmitted\ndiseases, including Aids, and alcohol\nand drug abuse. Those who\nfall ill in town often return home to\ndie. The result is that villagers frequently\nattend funerals.\nAlthough the perceptions of John\nKamande and other rural inhabitants\nmay contradict the popularly held\nbeliefs' of Nairobi researchers,\nthey may accurately reflect changing\npatterns of life and death in\nKenya. -Iris Feature\nAids drug gives hope\nto children infected\nwith the Aids virus\nBy CATHERINE MGENDI\nOne of the Aids drugs, Zidovudine\n- commonly known as AZT,\nhas been found to reduce the\nchances of a mother passing Aids/\nHIV to her child by between 67 to\n70 per cent.\nThe findings about AZT are capable\nof drastically reducing \"the\nunnecessary deaths\" of children\nwho innocently get infected with\nthe Aids virus.\nProf Frank Plummer of the University\nof Nairobi's Std/Hiv Collaborative\nGroup recently said the\nfindings could significantly impact\non the Aids situation in Africa.\n\"Being able to treat Hiv-positive\nmothers and their children would\nbe wonderful. But it is neither applicable\nnor practical in Africa because\nAZT is extremely expensive.\n\"\nThe retail price of two pills of\nAZT in the US (about $2 last year),\nwas found to be equivalent to the\naverage annual per capita spendings\non health in some developing\ncountries.\nProf Plummer advised Kenya and other African countries to instead\nconcentrate on the prevention\nof transmission of Aids and other\nStds because \"drugs only make\npeople live for slightly longer\".\nClose to two million children\nthroughout the world are currently\ninfected with the Aids/Hiv virus,\naccording to Dr Grace John, a\nmember of the Collaborative\nGroup.\nIt is estimated that by the year\n2000, as many as 10 million children\nthroughout the world will be\ninfected with the Aids virus, 90 per\ncent of whom will be found in developing\ncountries, according to\nFamily Health International (FHI).\nStatistics from the National Aids\nControl Programme indicate that 30\nto 40 per cent of all babies born of\nHiv-positive mothers get infected\nand die of Aids, on average, within\nthe first five years of their lives.\nThe use of AZT by expectant\nmothers could drastically minimise\nthe chances of the 1110tberspassing\non the virus to their baby 'either ill\nuterus, during: delivery or during\nbreast feeding. ,. AZT is, however, also known to\nbe toxic and to cause anaemia and\nmuscular dystrophy. Its long-term\neffects on the mother and child are\nalso unknown, according to the Coordinator\nof the National Aids Control\nProgramme, Dr Martin Kayo.\nOther than the inhibitive cost, the\ninitial mode of administration of\nthe drug required mothers to use infant\nformula, which is contrary to\npractices in most developing countries\nwhere mothers, regardless of\ntheir health status, are encouraged\nto breast feed their children . FHI estimates on the likelihood\nof the virus being transmitted via\nbreast feeding range from as low as\n16 per cent to a high 60 per cent,\nmaking it difficult for health workers\nto decide whether to advise\nwomen against suckling their\nyoung ones.\nStudies are going on to try and\ndetermine exactly at what stage of\npregnancy or lactation the virus is\npassed on to the baby in order to reduce\nthe required drug dosages and\nthe associated costs."}
