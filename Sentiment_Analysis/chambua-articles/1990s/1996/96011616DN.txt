{"text": "Wanted: Zambias Aids policy\nActivists allege work bias\n\nLUSAKA. Monday\nLack of a pragmatic national Aids\npolicy has led to the victimisation\nof employees infected with Aids or\nHIV, the virus which leads to Aids,\nin most, if not all, workplaces in\nZambia.\nMr Winston Zulu, who in 1991\nbecame the first Zambian to publicly\ndeclare he is HIV positive, believes\nthe government has been in\nan \"unforgivable slumber\" since\nthe first Aids case was reported in\n1985. He says a workable national\nAids policy is imperative to deal\nwith the increasing numbers of\nthose afflicted.\n\"There is an urgent need for the\ngovernment to formulate a policy\non Aids that will go a long way to\nprotect the human rights of the HIV/\nAids sufferers against any form\nof discrimination,\" says Mr Zulu,\nwho pioneered the formation of a\ngroup of HIV positive people called\nthe Positive And Living Squad\n(PALS).\nMr Zulu is a public relations officer\nof an Aids-awareness organisation,\nthe Kara Counselling Training\nTrust in Lusaka.\t\nHe notes that \"although there\nhas been high-flown rhetoric by\ngovernment authorities expressing\nconcern about the Aids epidemic,\nthe government has lamentably\nfailed to address the problem\nthrough a concrete policy.\n\"It is sad that our politicians are\nconcerned only about talking of the\ndangers of HIV/Aids, but are literally\ndoing nothing to help stop\nAids-related discrimination in\nworkplaces.\" He says the government\nis mute to \"an inhuman and\nunchristian situation\" where those\nin the workplace affected by, or perceived to be affected by HIV/\nAids, are not entitled to health insurance.\n\"To compound the problem, insurance\ncompanies also refuse to\nprovide insurance premiums .for\nHIV/Aids. This gross violation of\nhuman rights against those who are\nalienated because of their HIV /Aids\nstatus is prevalent in Zambia in the\nabsence of viable policy on Aids.\nThrough a closely monitored policy\non Aids, the government must intervene\nwhere employers dismiss\nHIV-positive workers on the\ngrounds that they pose a danger to\nother employees.\"\nMr Zulu also says that there is urgent\nneed for the government to revamp\nthe operations of the National\nAids Prevention and Control\nProgramme (NAPCP). \"The\nNAPCP is adversely affected ,in\ncarrying out its programmes effectively\nbecause of lack of funding by\nthe government on the pretext that\nit has no money. But I wonder from\nwhere the same government gets\nthe vast sums of money to fund the\ncostly by-elections.\"\nMr Zulu's concerns about a\nnational policy on AIDS are shared\nby a local non-governmental organisation,\nthe Zambia National Aids\nNetwork (ZNAN), which says it is\nto approach President Frederick\nChiluba on the issue. In a positive\nmove to insure a national Aids policy\nis put in place soon, the formation\nof a National AIDS Council is\nunderway with a demand by ZNAN\nthat Mr Chiluba appoints a chief  executive to the council.\nIn Lusaka, another NGO, the\nFamily Health Trust (FHT), has\nabout 300 people on its list of its home-based care project who visit\nthem in their homes to provide food\nand clinical assistance. Executive\ndirector Elizabeth Mataka says: \"Many families or households cannot\nsupport their HIV/Aids relatives\nadequately because they are\nalso overburdened by the crippling effects of the country's economy.\"\nMs Mataka says that the condition\nof victims has been worsened\nby the collapse of the traditional extended\nfamily system which has\n\"created a lot of problems for HIV/\nAids sufferers who have been\nabandoned by their own relatives\nand have no means of livelihood\".\nMs Mataka explains that it is\nagainst this grim background that\nthe FHT initiated the home-care\nproject in the Kamanga shanty\ntown to visit patients after they are\ndischarged from the University\nTeaching Hospital.\n\"The Kamanga project acts as\nthe first link in a chain of care\nstretching between people with HIV/\nAids in the community and the\nhospital-based health services,\"\nMs Mataka says.\nShe adds that, as the project has\nproved a success, the FHT has extended\nits services to other shanty\ntowns around Lusaka, and is moving\ninto the rural areas. \"Given the\nresources, we want to reach as\nmany people in both the urban and\nrural areas.\"\nFHT researcher Susan Foster\nsays: \"The cost of home-care can\nbe prohibitive, particularly for families\nin the community that are responsible for taking care of .\npatients. \" She says a few\nknown progrmnmes have at\na large amount of funding while\nothers have had to survive on shoestring\nbudgets.\nMs Foster says the spread of\nhome-care,. if properly integrated\ninto the overall health development\nprogramming, could shift part of\nthe burden of care from the government\nhealth services, which cannot\ncope.
