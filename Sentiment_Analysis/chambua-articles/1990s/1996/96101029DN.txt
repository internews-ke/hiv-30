The eventual\ncost per trainee is envisaged to be\nsubstantially lower than through the traditional training he curriculum which consists of\n24 modules of six units each cover\nall aspects of STD and Aids control\nsuch as human sexual behaviour,\nclinical management, socio-economic\nimpact, medico-legal issues\nand others.\nThe decision to develop this\nprogramme came about because the\nmajority of private practitioners felt\nthey had \"little time\" to spend in\nworkshops."}
