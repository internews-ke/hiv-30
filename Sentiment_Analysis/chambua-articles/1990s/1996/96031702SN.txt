{"text": "Society rejects Aids drug\nBy SUNDAY NATION\nCorrespondent\nProf Arthur Obel must stop the circulation of the controversial anti-Aids drug, Pearl Omega, the\nKenya Aids Society has said.\nIn an open letter to Prof Obel signed by KAS director Joe Muriuki, the society said it was dangerous for the drug, whose side-effects have not yet been established, to be in circulation.\n\"Prof Obel must stop selling his drug with immediate effect until it [is] tested,\" the society said describing the sale of Pearl Omega as unethical.\nMr Muriuki said the society was aware that the drug, which Prof Obel announced recently in the Press, was on sale in various outlets at between Sh30,000 and Sh 120,000 per dose.\nHe said the drug had started circulating even before the surprising announcement about its efficacy was made through the Press.\nAccording to the society, Prof Obel should publicly announce that the sale of the drug had been stopped.\nShould he not do so, the society threatened, it will take legal action against him\n\"Should you fail to carry these recommendations, we shall seek a court injunction immediately,\" the society said.\nLast month, it was announced that Dr Obel had found a cure for Aids and that it had been tested on\nHIV positive patients, some of whom had reverted to negative.\nLater, after challenges from the Government, the medical fraternity and other organisations, Prof\nObel withdrew his statement that he had discovered a cure for the disease."}
