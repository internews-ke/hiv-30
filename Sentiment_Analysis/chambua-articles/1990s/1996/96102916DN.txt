{"text": "Museums' mandate, mission to be redefined Director\nBy NATION Reporter\nThe National Museums of Kenya is redefining its mandate and mission to become more responsive to the current needs and problems of society, the Director announced yesterday.\nDr Mohamed Isahakia said the country's museums would, within the next two to three years, shed their old outlook as \"static exhibit showcases of the past.\"\nInstead, \"they will become in-stitutions that the public can identify with and from which time-tested solutions based on Kenyan traditions and culture can be drawn for modern-day problems.\" .\nOpening the 26th annual 'Know Kenya Course' at the Museums' Headquarters in Nairobi, Dr Isahakia said:\n\"The redefined mission or meaning of museums in Kenya is going to reflect our responsibility to society\" \nThis new definition means that we depart from the Eurocentric approach to museums, which basically is about having public galleries with displays, to make them a fora where all sorts of people meet and establish dialogue.\"\nHe admitted the museums had failed to address the issue of public service. But the intention now was to use the various exhibits, a computerised database of indigenous knowledge and research in-formation generated therein to seek out traditional solutions to society's problems.\n\"The museums will address issues of street children, Aids and HIV, health, unemployment, ethnic reconciliation and democracy, among others.\"\nThe museum, for instance, would put up an exhibit on the cultural dimension of preventive medicine, combine it with modern scientific information and national statistics in the case of HIV/Aids. \"I hope the museums will embrace the spirit of cultural integration by promoting cross-cultural understanding between the various ethnic communities as the means of creating stability and democracy,\" Dr Isahakia told the participants.\nAs a result of these changes, the museums would consolidate their research activities \"in certain strategic and well-defined areas, such as archaeology.\""}
