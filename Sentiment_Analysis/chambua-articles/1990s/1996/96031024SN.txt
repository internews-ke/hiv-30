{"text": "SUNDAY MARCH 10 1996\n\nSwedes set to test\u2028\n new HIV vaccine\u2028\nSwedish scientists will soon begin\ntesting on humans a new genetic\nHIV vaccine which they believe\nwill strengthen the immune system.\nBritta Wahren, a professor at\nSweden's Karolinska Institute\nwhich awards the prestigious Nobel\nmedicine prize, says the tests will\nbegin in about a month on nine\npeople infected with the fatal virus\nthat causes Aids.\nTests on animals showed the immune\nsystem had reacted positively\nto similar genetic vaccines.\n\"It looks promising ... but it remains\nto be seen if it works as well\non humans,\" she said ..\nThe genetic vaccine, which does\nnot have a specific name and is not\nsponsored by a drugs company,\nconsists of single genes from the\nHIV-virus which are injected into a\npatient's muscle.\n\"This is a so-called naked DNA\nwhich is ... directly injected into\nthe muscle where it moves to the\ncell's nucleus and starts producing\nprotein,\" Wahren said.\nThe process activates the immune\nsystem to go into battle\nagainst the virus, she said.\nSeveral similar vaccines are\nbased on the same principle, among\nthem flu vaccines.\nWahren said results of the tests in\nSweden would answer the question\nas to whether it is possible to improve\nthe immune system in humans\nsuffering from HIV.\n\"We should see the results in\na few months. If it works we will\ncontinue with more tests,\" she said.\nThe patients who will receive the\ninjections have HIV but not Aids\nand their infections are at an early ,\nstage, which may make them more\nsusceptible to treatment.\n\u2022. , The Karolinska Institute is cooperating\nwith the Swedish Institute\nfor Infectious Disease Control\nand the Soder Hospital in Stockholm\nfor the research project.\n-Reuter"}
