{"text": "Thursday, MAY, 1996\n\nAids: The long search for cure\u2028\nBy KIPKOECH TANUI\u2028\nFifteen years into the Aids epidemic, a search for a cure appears a mission in futility, but there is still a\u2028\ngood\u2019 possibility of turning it into a\u2028\nchronic disease instead of the quick\u2028\nkiller it is now.\u2028\nOur suspect Pearl Omega aside,\u2028\nAmerica\u2019s Z Zidovudine (popularly\u2028\nknown as AZT) remains the hope of many.\u2028\nAZT, the world\u2019s first anti-H1V drug to be developed, has been described by researchers as remark able in its ability to cause a drop in the amount of virus in the blood stream alid boosts the number of infection-fighting CD4 white blood cells that are destroyed by HIV.\u2028\nWhile scientists have won various battles by way of successfully\u2028\npreventing and treating symptoms such as pneumonia and other secondary infections that often kills\u2028\nAids patients, progress in the main\u2028\nwar has painfully been wanting.\u2028\nIn the case of AZT, for example, the bad news is that the virus ultimately overcomes the drug by mutating and becoming resistant.\u2028\nBut even worse is the fact that the\u2028\nannual treatment of Aids with the\u2028\ndrug for one single person, is unaffordable lo most people.\u2028\nTwo AZT pills last year in the\u2028\nUS cost $2 (Shi 12), a figure that is\u2028\nequivalent to the average annual\u2028\nper capita spending on health in\u2028\nmany countries in Africa, a continent which has 70 per cent of the\u2028\nworld\u2019s H1V cases.\u2028\nThe war against Aids appeared\u2028\nheaded for success in February\u2028\nwhen studies completed Last year\u2028\nfor the first time showed that various combinations of AZT and related drugs can slow the progression\u2028\nof H1V infection and temporarily\u2028\nkeep death at bay.\u2028\nBut again, the combination will\u2028\nbe far out of reach to most people\u2028\nfor they cost between Sh26 1,000\u2028\nand Sh435,000."}
