{"text": " JULY 7, 1996\nNo hope for Aids drug\t\nVANCOUVER (British Columbia)\nSaturday\nThe best hope of conquering AIDS\nlies in the development of a vaccine,\nbut governments and drug\ncompanies are virtually ignoring\nthis critical area of research, scientists\nsaid.\nAfter more than a decade of\nAIDS research, no vaccine has advanced\nto large-scale trials in humans\nand researchers believe the\nintroduction of a vaccine is at least\nfive years away and probably longer\nat the current pace of study.\n\"It is a joke,\" said Mr Donald Francis, a pioneer in AIDS virology at the US Centres for Disease Control\nand, now president of Genenvax\nInc. which is working on a vaccine.\n\"There is only one way you are\ngoing to stop this virus and that's\nwith a vaccine ... We need to do\nmore,\" he said.\nProspects for a vaccine will be\nhotly debated at the IIth International\nConference on AIDS which\nstarts on Sunday in Vancouver. A\nnew global effort to promote research\ninto an AIDS vaccine will be\nlaunched on Sunday in Vancouver\nwith backing from the United\nNations and the Rockefeller Foundation. Every day about 8,500 people\nworldwide are infected with the\nhuman immunodeficiency virus\n(HIV) that causes AIDS. Experts\nsay prevention efforts like safe-sex\neducation campaigns are worthwhile\nbut are not enough to halt the\nspread.\nVaccines, which produce immunity\nto a disease and have eradicated\nsmallpox and made strides toward\neliminating polio in recent\ndecades, offer the best hope of a solution.\n\"In the long run if we are going\nto have a substantial impact on the\n(AIDS) epidemic we have to look to ...vaccines,\" said researcher David\nHo of New York's Aaron Diamond\nCentre. Science in this area\nis not progressing very rapidly. We\nhave nothing to speak of today that'\ncould be used widely.\" Researchers\nblame slow progress so far in\nAIDS vaccines on a shortage of\nfunding and hesitancy among drug\ncompanies. They say drug companies\nsee uncertain profit prospects\nand potentially large liabilities if\nvaccines do not work. They also\ncite a lack of government leadership.\nSome experimental vaccines\nhave shown promise in tests. -\nReuter"}
