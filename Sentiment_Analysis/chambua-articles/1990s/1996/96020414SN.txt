{"text": "New drugs give hope\nfor Aids breakthrough\nBy JOE OMBUOR\nand Agencies\nLight. Or what is it we are seeing at the\nend of the Aids tunnel?\nThat would seem to be the case considering\nlast week's announcement in the\nUnited States that the battle against the\ndeadly ailment has reached a turning\npoint after a new drug therapy was found\nto cut the amount of the virus in victims to\n, \"undetectable\" levels in most test cases,\nAids specialists at a four-day conference\non retroviruses and' opportunistic infections\nin Washington DC, applauded\n, the results as \"a breakthrough\":\n\"We finally have something to tell\npeople- get tested and get treated,\" declared\na participant. \"This is not just a\nmatter of option and opinion anymore.\nThere are treatments\" ,\nEven though they warned that the treatment\ncould not yet be conclusively\ntermed a cure for Aids, they said \"these\nresults should be extremely encouraging\nto doctors and patients. ' ,\nIn the new therapy, doctors have\nmatched a \"protease inhibitor\" with\nother anti-Aids chemicals,\nProtease inhibitors attack an enzyme\ncalled protease which HIV needs late in\nits reproductive stage.\nScientists applauded results from\nmatching a Merck-produced protease inhibitor called Crixivan with AZT and\n3TC which are already on the market.\nThe linking packs a hefty molecular\npunch with the late-life cycle effects of\nCrixivan - also known as indinavir -\nbeing matched up with AZT' and 3TC\nwhich attack a protein necessary for the\nearly stages of the virus.\nThe test mixture was given to 26 patients\nby New York University researchers.\nAfter six months, no measurable trace\nof the Aids virus could be detected in 24\nof them,\nThe amount of the virus circulating in\nthe blood is an important index of the evolution\nof the disease.\nThe reduction and maintenance of reduced\nlevels should keep up the health of\nthe patients, according to specialists.\nResearchers caution that the combination\nis not a cure and say it is too soon to\nknow how long the drugs can hold off the\nvirus.\nOne of the most frustrating features of\nthe Aids-causing virus is its ability to mutate\nquickly and overcome the effects of\ndrug therapy.\nThe new therapies open doors that will\nmake 1996 a turning point and a breakthrough for treatment because the viral\ncontent can be lowered to the point where\nit is no longer detectable, some researchers\nsaid,\n\"This is the first time they have had the\nquantity of the virus fall below the detection\nlevel nine out of 10 times,\" said Dr\nJacques Leibowitch, head of the immunovirology\nservice at the Raymond Poincare\nHospital in Garches, France, who has\nbeen conducting his own tests.\nBi-therapy, the use of two-drug combinations,\nare outmoded and the practice\nshould head toward tri-therapy, he said.\nFirst isolated in 1983, the AIDS virus has proved to be a tougher enemy than\nscientists ever imagined.\nA retrovirus that insinuates itself into a\nperson's genetic material, Aids-causing\nHIV progressively destroys infection fighting\nwhite blood cells, leaving its victims\nunable to fight off other illnesses.\nWhile scientists have made considerable\nprogress in preventing and treating\npneumonia and other secondary infections\nthat often kill Aids patients, progress against the virus it self has been halting.\nAZT, the first anti-HIV drug to be developed,\ncauses an immediate drop in the\namount of virus in the bloodstream and\nboosts the number of infection-fighting\nCD4 white blood cells that are destroyed\nBy HIV.\nBut the virus ultimately overcomes the\ndrug by mutating and becoming resistant. Resistance has also dogged ddI and\nddC, both chemical cousins of AZT.\nBut studies completed last ,year show,\nfor the first time, that various combinations\nof AZT and related drugs can slow\nthe progression of HIV infection and delay\ndeath.\nAZT administered alone was less effective\nthan the combinations.\nWhat's more, 3TC, approved by United\nStates' Food and Drug Administration\n(FDA) last year, has the unusual ability to\nmake HIV that has become resistant to\nAZT reacquire its susceptibility to the\ndrug.\nThe new treatments are expected to be\navailable within months. The FDA is expected\nto act swiftly to approve them.\nThe Third Conference of Retroviruses\nand Opportunistic Infections opened in\nWashington Monday and ended on Thursday.\nOther recent advances in the battle\nagainst Aids include a discovery by scientists\nof a protein in human saliva that\nblocks the virus from infecting the immune\nsystem cells.\nResearchers say the protein, called secretory\nleucocyte protease inhibitor\n(SLPI), provides protection by binding\nitself to the surface of white blood cells\nthat help orchestrate the body's immune\nresponse to infection. They ,have discerned\na possibility. of eventually 'injecting SLPI directly into the blood stream to\n. keep, the virus 'from attacking blood cells.\nalso encouraging is the discovery by\n. scientists at the New York Blood Centre\nthat. a chemically-modified version of a\nprotein' found in' cow's milk blocks HIV\ntransmission in human cells.\nThe scientists divulged at the Washington\nconference that the milk compound\ncould be eventually formulated into a\nfoam or cream applied topically to provide\na barrier against infection.\nThe foam or cream could come in\nhandy as additional protection with\ncondoms and for the use of women without\nco-operation from male partners, scientists\ntold the conference.\nScientists have named the compound,\nB69. They say it binds itself to receptor\nsites on the critical white blood cells\nknown as CD4 that are targets for sexual\ntransmission of the HIV virus hence preventing\ninfection by blocking the virus\nfrom coming into contact with the cells.\nThe Japanese on their part have found\nan anti-body that kills cells infected with\nHIV. The anti-body, christened Immune\nGlobulin M, was found by researchers in\nblood serums of people yet to develop\nAids after carrying the virus for more than\na decade.\nThe scientists are confident that if cultivated,\nthe anti-body would be an effective\nAids drug. They note that only a limited\nnumber of people have such types of serums\nalthough a certain group of people\nwith special backgrounds or physical conditions\nare seen to' have the anti-body,\nIn Australia, researchers are working\non the world's first attempt to neutralise\nAid using a process known as gene\nshears whereby white blood cells from an\nAids-free twin is modified and injected\ninto an HIV positive one. The enzyme so\nproduced is believed to have the capacity\nto slice up HIV and slow its reproduction.\nScientists say that if successful and\nsafe, the enzyme so produced would be\ndeveloped to treat the virus in all carriers.\nResearch is going side by side with\ndrug therapy which, though not curative,\ncan slow down the proliferation of the virus\nconsiderably.\nRecently, a 38-year-old American Aids\nvictim had baboon bone marrow transplanted\ninto him \"to boost his immune\nsystem\". Baboons, researchers say, have\nbeen found to be resistant to HIV-I, the\nprimary virus causing Aids.\nMr Jeff Getty left the hospital \"feeling\nbetter\" and contented that even if the experiment\ndoes not save his life, it would\nlead to a treatment that would save thousands\nof others.\nA Kenyan Aids victim and her child who tested HIV negative: 1996 may be the\nturning point in Aids research.\n'The therapies open doors that\nwill make 1996 a turning point'\n\nCost factor\nstill cause\nfor worry\nTherapeutic treatment to slow the\nprogression of HIV and prolong life\nis now shifting from single drugs\nsuch as AZT, which has been used\nwidely in Kenya and other third\nworld countries, to a three-pronged\napproach involving a combination\nof drugs. Yet AZT, the only anti-\nAids drug known here after the bangled\nexperiment with Kemron and\nImmunex in the early '90s, currently\ncosts Sh133 per 100 gram tablet.\nIncoming varieties such as 3CT\ncould cost a lot more.\nAZT, a drug that causes an immediate\ndrop in the count of HIV virus\nin the blood stream 'while boosting\nthe number of infection-fighting\nCD4 white blood cells, is available\nlocally but its chemical cousins ddl\n(Didanosine) and ddC are unavailable.\nLike AZT, these two are ultimately\novercome by the virus through\nmutation leading to drug resistance.\n3TC, the newly developed drug capable\nof making HIV that has become\nresistant to AZT re-acquire its\nsusceptibility to the drug, is expected\nin the country soon, according t\nsources at Glaxo-Wellcome.\n\"It should be arriving soon.\nhave applied for approval from the\nMinistry of Health and we're waiting,\"\nsaid the source.\nEven if all the drugs in the market\nwere to become locally available,\nKenyans and others in the Third\nWorld would still have a problem:\nThey will not afford them.\nScientists at the conference on retroviruses,\nand opportunistic infections\nwhich ended in Washington\nDC last week were apprehensive\nabout prices.\nThey noted with concern that a\n\"cocktail\" of several antiviral drugs\ncosts thousands of dollars a year.\nThough retail prices of the new\nprotease inhibitors are not yet\nknown, activists and physicians do\nnot expect them to be cheap.\nSome say Aids patients could be\nfaced with $12,000 to $18,000 -\nSh680,000 to Sh l million - a year in\nbills just for prescription medicine,\nCommenting on the pricing at t\nend of the conference, the National\nInstitute of Health (NIH) direct\nMr William Paul said: \"My job is to\nhelp science ... the NIH is not the\nright place to figure out drug\npricing\" .\nBut the director agreed that the\ncosts could be a problem in the industrialised\nand developing worlds.\nTwenty researchers affiliated to\nprominent hospitals and universities\nwrote an open letter to hospitals,\ninsurers, state, and federal governments\nsaying:\n\"The news is very good but please\ngive us the means to provide these\nsubstantial advances in therapy to\nour patients.\"\nOne thing remains clear though:\nIn as much as the drug 'findings are\nencouraging, the key to combating\nthe epidemic remains prevention.\n- JOE OMBUO"}
