{"text": "Ndetei wrong about marriage\nIn an interview on KBC Radio, Kibwezi MP Agnes Ndetei recently advocated the education of girls instead of female circumcision as a way of preparing a girl for womanhood.\nWhile the campaign to eradicate the primitive practice of female genital mutilation should be encouraged, Mrs Ndetei's views on the purpose of educating a girl are disappointing. She says education should serve to prepare a girl to stand alone raise a family and erase the idea of marriage completely from her mind and calls the notion\n\"empowering the women\". In other words she is calling for single parenthood for educated women. Does she not recognise the importance of marriage in bringing up children whose happiness comes from the love and support of both father and mother?\nFrom where will the educated women get children'?\nIn these days when everyone is concerned about Aids and other STDs how will single parenthood help to control the menace?\nDon't forget, Mrs Ndetei you are well educated yourself. but I think you are happily married,\naren't you?\nM.
