{"text": "Why mouth guards are a must for boxers\nQuestion: I am an upcoming boxer who\nlikes this sport. I have, however,' come\nacross some conflicting information regarding\nmouth guards for boxers.\nA: First and foremost, no boxer should ever\nengage in a sparing workout or boxing contest\nwithout mouth guards. \nOne time I was called to assist with the ring\nside provision of medical services at a daylong\nmarathon boxing contest that was being\nused to select a few boxers for a very important\ntournament. To my disappointment, I observed\nmany boxers shared their gum shields\nafter a very brief rinse in cold water. This\nshould never happen as it exposes boxers to\nthe other persons body fluids thus risk of HIV\n(Aids) transmission, also the transmission of\nthe other numerous oral cavity infections\nranging from bacterial to viral infections.\nFurther to this, the gum shields do not provide\nthe required protection since they are not individually custom made. All they provide is a\npsychological sense of protection.\nIt is estimated in the USA that between 15\nper cent to 17per cent of all sports injuries occur\nin the facial area. Further empirical survey\nindicates that as many as 2 million teeth\nare knocked out annually with every athlete\nhaving about a 10 percent chance of sustaining\nan oral-facial injury according to the\nsports Dentistry Academy.\nMany athletes go to sporting goods stores\nfor over the counter protective devices. While\nthese may provide some limited protection to\ninjury, they do not address the individual\ncharacteristics of each athlete. This is especially\ntrue for children between the age of six\nand 12 whose mouths are changing as they\ngrow.\nThe most common over the counter gum\nshield or mouth guard have to be held down\nin place by constantly biting down which interferes\nwith speech and-breathing. Often athletes\nalter or cut these mouth guards to make\nthem fit, thus they even become less protective\n..\nThe \"boil and bite\" is another very common\nmouth guard on the market. It is made\nfrom a, thermoplastic material that is immersed\nin boiling water and formed in the \nmouth by using finger tongue and biting\npressure. These, however, although they fit\nbetter than the ready to use mouth guards,\nthey still do not fit as well as custom-made\nmouth guards. They make no allowance for\nbroken, missing, loose or erupting teeth. Besides. the thickness of the plastic is reduced\nby at, least 70 per cent during the moulding\nprocess, taking  away protective properties.\nAlthough this may be expensive for the average\nathlete, custom-made mouth guards are\nthe most favourable and are supplied by the\ndentist after a comprehensive oral and dental examination.\nWhile developing a custom-made mouth\nguard, the dentist takes into account factors\nlike sport being played, level of competition,\nprevious dental injuries or problems and ongoing\northodontic treatment.\nThe general criterion when acquiring protective\nsports mouth guards, regardless of\nwhere they are purchased or they are formed,\nshould fulfill all the following properties:\nAdaptability (fits individual structure of\nmouth)\nRetention (says in the mouth\nComfort for athlete\nStability (doesn't move around in the mouth)\nShould have minimum interference with\nbreathing and peaking. Gum shields should\nserve to provide protection against oral injures.\nIt is strongly advised to avoid sharing\nmouth guards at all costs in this day and age\nwhere especially the risk of HIV transmission\ncannot be rule out."}
