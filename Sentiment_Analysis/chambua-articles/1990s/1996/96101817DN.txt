{"text": "Aids toll on health budget\nBy KEN OPALA\nAids control programmes threaten to consume the recurrent health budget by the year 2000, Vice-President George Saitoti said yesterday.\nTo reverse this trend, Kenyans will have to change their ways and assault social and religious taboos that hinder effectiveness of such programmes, he said .\n\" ... the direct and indirect cost of this epidemic could reach as high as 15 per cent of our Gross Domestic Product by the year 2000, compared to an estimated two to four per cent in 1991,\" said the V-P when launching a book on the socio-economic impact of Aids at the Grand Regency Hotel yesterday.\nThe I89-page AIDS in Kenya: Socio-economic Impact and Policy Implication is a chilling documentation of Aids prevalence in Kenya.\nIt says that about 230,000 'Kenyans may be infected with HIV this year alone.\nThe book, produced following a research funded by the United States Agency for International Development, Family Health International, and Aids Control and Prevention Project, among others, says Sh 15 billion could be spent on Aids control in the year 2010.\nProf Saitoti, who is also the Minister for Planning and National Development, said that although much effort had gone towards control of the disease, many Kenyans were succumbing to the scourge daily.\n\"The adult prevalence rates have steadily grown from 3.5 per cent in 1990 to 5.7 per cent for 1993 and 1995 respectively.\"\nHe said the Aids pandemic had failed to stabilise because of lack of funds and the reluctance to change some socio-cultural practices.\nSince the first Aids case was identified in Kenya 12 years ago, he said, more than 1.1 million Kenyans had been infected with HIV while 65,647 were reported sufferers.\nHe said half of the 18 million Aids sufferers worldwide were in Africa.\nHe said: \"Although the global Aids epidemic is now spreading faster in other parts of the world ... in terms of new infections, Africa experienced an increase in Aids cases as a result of HIV infections some ten years ago\"\nThrough various projects, the Kenya Government has attempted to fight the scourge, he said and pledged that it would do even more in future.\nThe United States Ambassador, Mrs Prudence Bushnell, said her Government was ready to assist\nKenya tackle the Aids problem, which she described as serious and needing immediate attention.\n\"When your brother, your sister, your friend dies of Aids, Kenya loses its future. We cannot let this happen,\" she said.\nAll sectors, from donors to nongovernmental organisations, religious bodies and the Government, should work as partners in stopping the disease.\nThe World Health Organisation Representative in Kenya, Dr Paul Chuke, said the launch of the book was well timed.\nHe described the book as well researched, and it is informative and empowering\"\nTo effectively fight Aids, Dr Chuke said, \"cultural and religious taboos will have to bend.\" \n\nVice-President George Saitoti and US Ambassador Prudence Bushnell flip through the Aids book launched in Nairobi yesterday.\n\nControl policy document ready\nBy KEN OPALA and CATHERINE MGENDI\nA policy document on the control of Aids is complete and will soon be discussed by the Cabinet, the Director of Medical Services said yesterday.\n\"The Sessional Paper will show the cost of Aids and how the disease will be tackled,\" Dr James Mwanzia said at the launch of a book on the prevalence and socio-economic implications of the disease in Kenya.\nThe I89-page Aids in Kenya: Socio-economic Impact and Policy Implications was authored by 25 professionals.\nThe DMS presented statistics to prove that Aids was a major problem countrywide. Currently he said, more than 1.2 million Kenyans were infected with HIV.\nUnfortunately, he said, rural areas were now reporting high infection despite the low prevalence a few years ago.\n\"More and more young people are infected, with infections growing fastest among young women between 15 to 24 years of age\"\nHe said the situation was imposing a \"huge burden\" on the health services. In many districts, said Dr\nMwanzia virtually all available beds were occupied by Aids patients.\nThe book launched yesterday is distributed free of charge. It recommends, among other things, the creation of a national task force to design and implement intervention programmes for Aids orphans.\nMeanwhile, a new national Aids report says more than 200,000 Kenyans will this year become infected with the Aids virus if the current intervention strategies are not reviewed.\n\"The National Aids and STD Control Programme estimates that, in 1996, an additional 230,000 Kenyans could become infected with HIV under the current level or investment in HIV interventions\"\nSince January 16 this year 63,179 cases of full-blown Aids have been reported \"which represents only a quarter of all actual Aids cases\", the report says.\nThe report, Aids in Kenya: Policy Responses and Opportunities also says that about 300.000 children aged under 15 will be orphaned through Aids this year.\nIt is projected that this number of Aids orphans will have doubled by the turn or the century, and is likely to reach the million mark by the year 2005.\nThe report is a joint product of among others the National Aids and STD Control Programme and Family Health International's Aids control and Prevention Project (Aidscap).\nThe growing number or Aids orphans, the report says, is already overwhelming the traditional extended-family support structures in parts of the country.\nSome Kenyan households, it says, are headed by children as young as 10."}
