{"text": "Plan of action for\noral health in Africa\nAfrica, there has been, with ring income and urbanisation,\na clear switch from great dependence on traditional\nstarchy and fibrous staple foods, to markedly\nincreased consumption of refined carbohydrates.\nIn addition to the problem of dental caries, the\nprevalence of periodontal gum-disease remains\nhigh, affecting nearly all age groups, socio-economic\nstrata and geographical areas.\n. Several studies have examined the prevalence and\nseverity of periodontal lesions in many African populations\nand have socio-economically underprivileged\nAfrican children who are nutritionally and immunologically\ncompromised. _\nApart from the two most common oral disease\n(dental caries arid periodontal disease), there are\nother oral conditions which are a cause for serious\nconcern in the countries of the Region. These\ninclude:\n\u2022 Oral manifestations of systemic diseases, including\nHIV infection/AIDS.\n\u2022 Oral cancer and precancerous lesions.\n\u2022 Benign tumours ..\n\u2022 Acute and chronic infections of the oral tissues.\n\u2022 Maxillo-facial trauma from automobile accidents\nand physical. injuries.\n\u2022 Severe fluorosis\nThe oral health manpower statistics from 197I-\n198] reveal that there was relatively little trained\npersonnel in the African Region.\nThere were a:total of2,600 oral health workers,\nmore than half of whom were dental surgeons most-\n1ytrained outside the African Region.\nSince 198], considerable development of oral\nhealth workforce has taken place within Africa.\nAlthough the FDI Basic Fact Sheets (] 990) record\n2,602 dentists, ] ,242 dental therapists hygienists and\ntechnicians and 55] other oral health personnel,\nhowever from country 'reports, it is estimated that at\nDecember ]99], there are 13,100 oral health workers\nin the region made up 9,978 dental surgeons,\n2,476 dental auxiliaries (dental therapists, dental hygienists,\ndental technicians, dental assailants) and\n646 other oral health personnel. .\nIt is significant to note that abut 80 per cent of the\ntrained professional personnel live and work in affluent\nneighborhoods in the cities although the bulk\nof the indigenous populations (70~80 per cent) reside\nin rural areas.\nThere are] 7 training institutions at .university level\nwhere dental surgeons are trained. They are located\nin nine. countries in the African Region of WHO.\nThere are also 13 countries with institutions or establishments for training different types of dental\nauxiliaries.\nMost member states do no have comprehensive\nnational oral. health policies and plans.\nData available at the WHO Regional office indicate\nthat as of April 1993, only ]2 countries in the\nregion have national oral health policies and plans\nmost of which still have to be fully implemented and\nevaluated.\nIn collaboration with the Government of the Republic\nof Nigeria, the first WHO-supported Inter country\nCentre for Oral Health in Africa (ICOH)\nwas opened in Jos, Nigeria in June 1988.\n. The overall objective of the centre is to identify\nways of improving national approaches to oral\nhealth and to stimulate and strengthen the interest in\na collaborative effort to improve national oral health\nservices research.\nIt is envisaged that the centre will in no small way\nassist in the. integration of oral health in the countries'\nprimary health care programmes.\nBetween 1989 and 1993, the centre has organised\neight inter-country workshops, seminars and short\ncourses on management, training and research for\ndental surgeons and dental auxiliaries including the\nannual meeting of chief dental officers from the\nAfrican region of WHO....\nIn June] 992, the Division of Dentistry, University\nof Dar-es-Salaam in Tanzania was designated a\nWHO Collaborating Centre for primary oral health\ncare planning and research.\nIn general terms, when the existing oral health\ncare systems in African countries are reviewed for\nadequacy, relevance, efficiency, effectiveness and\nimpact, the emerging pattern ranges from poor fair.\nThe most important problems which need remedial\naction appear to include the following: .\n\u2022 Low priority given oral health in national health\nprogrammes in most African countries.\n\u2022 Lack of planning, administration and evaluation of\nservices.\n\u2022 Insufficient emphasis on prevention and' on multisectoral\nactivity, especially in relation to food policy\nand health education and promotion. Failure in manpower planning and utilising the\nmost appropriate personnel to carry out various dental procedures. Too many dentists are being trained\nand too few dental therapists and oral health educators.\n\u2022 Failure to adopt a primary health care approach\nwith its inherent commitment to community involvement. WHO/AFROagenda for action:\n. *** .\nAlthough oral diseases 'are not life-threatening. their\nhigh prevalence, public demand, drain on economic\nresources and high cost in terms of pain, suffering\nand discomfort, make oral health care worthy of attention.\nThe situation has now reached a stage where a reorientation\nof services from oral disease and its\ntreatment to oral health and disease prevention is\nneeded.\nThe general objective is to promote oral health activities\naimed at increasing the coverage of the population\nwith improved oral health services.\nThe specific objective is to provide technical support\nto Member States to strengthen their capacity\nto:\n\u2022 Formulate comprehensive national oral health policies\nand plans based on primary health care with\nmechanisms for monitoring and evaluation.\n\u2022 Develop oral health preventive and promotive activities\nparticularly oral health education and information.\n\u2022 Develop adequate and appropriate training programmes\nfor oral health personnel at all levels of the\nhealth system.\n\u2022 Assemble adequale epidemiological information\non oral disorders for purposes of planning oral\nhealth programmes, monitoring trends and evaluating\nimpact of programmes.'\n\u2022 Carry out appropriate applied research activities. ... ***\n***\nTargets .\nOral health programme activities would focus mainly\non providing technical guidance to all Member States in the African Region so that:\n\u2022 By ]995, 18 countries will have launched an oral\nhealth policy and. plan ,based on primary health care.\n\u2022 By 1997, 15 countries will have launched district focus\noral health activities in order to strengthen the\noral health component! of primary health care.\n\u2022 By 1999, ]999, 10 countries will have developed a\nmechanism of evaluating the activities implemented\nin order to determine their impact on the oral disease\nprevalence. I\n***\nStrategies: i\nThe approaches and te4hniques to facilitate and accelerate\nand realisatiofil of the objectives should\ntherefore be the integnition of oral health into primary\nhealth care programmes based on African health\ndevelopment framework. In African countries with\nscarce resources, it is essential that oral health activities\nbe seen as part of primary health care strategy\nand integrated into regular health activities.\nThe incorporation of oral health into primary\nhealth care is one way to achieve economically feasible\naction for oral health maintenance.\nI! *** Activities:\nThe emphasis of the agenda for action is mainly on\nwhat can be done at the following levels in order to\nimprove management, training and research:\n\u2022 Local level- village~ and districts.\n\u2022 Intermediate level -hospitals, public health office\nand other sectors ..\nConclusion:\nAlthough oral health is a significant component of\ngeneral health care, it has not been given the attention it deserves in the provision of health care in.\ngeneral. ,\nThis situation is further aggravated by the serious\nshortage of appropriately trained oral health personnel.\n,\nHealth for all also means oral health for all and in\norder to be able to achive an acceptable standard of\noral health for all, African countries should develop\na realistic framework f6r the allocation of tasks and\nresponsibilities.\nOral health will be neglected if it remains a' vertical programme; if integrated into primary health\ncare, it will receive attention in all aspects of individual,\nfamily, community and national health.\nThe African health development framework is designed to reinforce community-based primary health\ncare activities and ensure that adequate and appropriate\nsupports is provided' by the higher level authority. The ultimate goal is the production of healthy people in a healthy environment."}
