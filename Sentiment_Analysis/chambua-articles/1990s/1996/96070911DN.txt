{"text": "Hope as Aids meeting opens\nThe world's biggest-ever Aids conference started yesterday with scientists excited by the promise of multi drug treatments, but still haunted by the relentless spread of\nthe disease and the remoteness of a\ncure.\nThe last six months have brought\nbreakthroughs with the introduction\nof drug treatments that now offer\nthe best hope of keeping Aids\npatients alive since the killer disease\nfirst made its appearance 15\nyears ago.\nThe 11th International Aids Conference,\nwhich has drawn 15;000\ndelegates from 125 countries,\ncomes amid a mood of optimism in\nsharp counterpoint to earlier meetings\nin Berlin and Yokahama, Japan.\nThe gloom there reflected researchers'\nfailure to combat a virus\nthat seemed always to outsmart\nthem.\n\"Nobody can call Aids an inevitably\nfatal, incurable disease anymore,\"\nDr Peter Piot, head of the\nUnited Nations Aids programme,\nsaid in an address opening the conference.\n\"We have not got a cure\nyet, but ... the new combinations of\nanti-retroviral drugs are holding out\nnew hope. \"\nThe main hope centres on new\ndrugs, called protease inhibitors,\nwhich block an enzyme crucial to\nthe multiplication of the HIV virus.\nTests so far have shown that when\ntaken in multi-drug \"cocktails\" including the medicine AZT, protease\ninhibitors have reduced the virus\nin the blood to undetectable\nlevels.\nNo one yet knows how effective\nthese inhibitors will be over the\nlonger-term, or whether the elusive virus will develop resistance to the\nnew treatments. But they do hold\nout the promise for the. first time\nthat some day Aids may not be a\ndeath sentence.\n\"We are helping (Aids patients)\nto live longer as opposed to merely\neasing pain and other symptoms.\"\nsaid Brian Gazzard, an Aids expert\nat London's Chelsea and Westminister\nHospital.\nEven so, medical researchers acknowledge\nthat the ultimate goal -\na cure for Aids - is not within\nsight. This reality, and evidence of\nthe disease's relentless spread, have\ntempered optimism in Vancouver.\n\"Let us hope but ... let us keep\nboth our feet on the ground,\" said\nDr Piot.\nThe United Nations estimated\n21.8 million people around the\nworld are living with the HIV virus\nor Aids. About 8.500 more people\nare infected daily - five every\nminute - with the human immunodeficiency\nvirus (HIV) that causes\nAids.\nSince the global pandemic took\nhold in the early I980s, 5.8 million\npeople have died of the disease,\nwhich destroys the immune system.\nMeanwhile, the meeting's organizers\ncautioned that while the preliminary\nfindings are a welcome\nchange, they do not represent a cure\n- although some Aids experts\nhave begun to talk about just that\npossibility.\n\"We don't want the pendulum to\nswing so far over that we have\nagain the state of very unrealistic\nexpectations that will leave people\"\nbitterly disappointed,\" said Dr\nMartin T. Schechter of the University\nof British Columbia, the conference\nco-chairman. \nIn all, nine Aids drugs are on the\nUS market, five oftl)em introduced\nthis year. The most important are\nthree in a new class called protease\ninhibitors, which block one step in\nHIV's reproductive cycle. When\ncombined with two older Aids\ndrugs, the virus appears to stop reproducing People have been taking various\nthree-drug combinations for about\n18 months, and in many - but not\nall - HIV disappears from the\nbloodstream.\nDr Michael V O'Shaughnessy,\nanother conference organiser, advised\nscepticism in judging the reports\nof these combinations, which will be presented at the meeting.\n\"Keep the hyperbole in perspective,\"\nhe asked reporters. \"There\nwill be a lot of overstatement of results.\"\nEven if the new treatments work\nas well as researchers hope, Dr Piot\nnoted they are likely to be little use\nto most of the world's HIV infected people. who cannot afford to pay\n$10,000 or $15,000 a year for treatment.\nAt the conference's opening ceremonies,\nprotesters organized\nby the Aids activist group Act Up\nunfurled banners denouncing drug companies\nfor the price of their\nAids medicines.\n\"Greed kills! Access for all!\"\nthey chanted, tossing bundles offake\n\"Aids profiteer\" money into\nthe air. According to UN figures, 21\nmillion people are living with HIV.\n90 per cent of them in developing\ncountries. Every day, 8,500 more people\n- including 1,000 children.\n-- become infected.\n\"What keeps me awake at night\n\" said Dr Piot, \"is the growing\nAids care gap - especially between\nthe developed and developing\nworld.\"\nIndia alone now has three million\npeople infected with HIV, more\nthan any other countries in the world.\nhe noted.\nUnlike in the United States and\nother industrialized nations, where\nAids spreads mostly through homosexual\nsex and dirty needles, Aids\nin poorer countries is largely a heterosexual\ndisease.\nDr Piot, however, said the first\nhints have appeared showing that\npoorer countries can stem the\nspread of the disease through diligent\ncondom education campaigns.\nHe noted the number of new HIV infections\nhas fallen in both\nUganda and Thailand. which have\nserious HIV epidemics. Despite\nwhat he called \"solid grounds for\nhope,\" Dr Piot said the Aids \"epidemic\nremains huge, unstable and\nmostly invisible. \"(Agencies)  \n\nAids activists march in Vancouver, Canada on Sunday as the 11th International Conference on Aids opened.\nThey called for lowering of drug prices.

Monday\nAids activists disrupted the opening\nceremony of the 11th International\nConference on Aids yesterday to\nprotest budget cuts that would eliminate\nfederal Aids funding in Canada.\nCanadian Prime Minister Jean\nChretien decided several months\nnot to attend the Aids conference\nhere, despite issuing a statement\nthat \"a member of his extended\nfamily\" has died of the disease.\nInstead he sent Health Minister\nDavid Dingwall to face the protests\nthat have become so common at\nAids conferences that they are virtually a\npart of the ritual.\nAs Mr Dingwall came to the podium,\ndozens of people rose, turned\ntheir backs on him, covered their\nears and began chanting \"shame,\"\neffectively drowning him out.\nAids Vancouver had issued a\npress release saying that they would\nturn their backs on Mr Dingwall as\nhe opened the conference on Sunday\nsince Mr Chretien was \"turning\nhis back on Aids.\"\nMr Dingwall was roundly booed\nas he finished speaking.\nMr Glen Clark, the premier of\nBritish Columbia, also took a jab at\nMr Chretien in greeting the 8,000\ndelegates at the conference.\n\"Nothing could have prevented\nme from being here today,\" he said\nsmiling to enthusiastic applause.\nMeanwhile, there is bad news on\nthe demographic front, as the fatal\ndisease shows signs of embedding\nitself into poor communities with\nlittle access to health care and little\ninterest in following admonitions\nthat safer sex and clean needles can\nreduce the risk of contracting the\ndeadly virus. Globally, 22 million\npeople are believed to carry HIV,\nthe virus that causes Aids, according\nto UN figures. The politics of conferences that\nattract scientists who have spent\nthree decades in laboratories as\nwell as .activists from groups such\nas ACT UP. which regularly disrupts\nAids conferences, can be\ntricky.\nConference organisers, some of\nwhom agree with the activists' call\nfor more funding, say that they have\ndecided to tolerate disruption to\ngive all sectors a voice.\nAids was reponsible for one percent\nof all deaths in Canada in 1993\nwith 16,000 reported cases and 9,\n000 fatalities. That's fewer than the\nUnited States but considerably\nmore than Australia, Britain, Germany\nand Sweden.\nBut Canada's problem could get\nworse. The median age at infection\nhas dropped to 23, according to Mr\nBrent Allen, the director of education\nfor Aids Vancouver.\nCanada spent 43.4 million Canadian\ndollars (32 million dollars) on\nAids in the 1994-1995 fiscal year,\nand Mr Chretien's Liberal Party is under pressure from the Reform\nParty to reduce that. .\n\"Vocal political activists on the\nside of Aids have been very effective.\nBut there's a large majority of\nCanadians who are unheard in\nterms of their needs,\" Reform Party\nMP Sharon Hayes told the Vancouver\nWeekend Sun.\nThe Reform Party appears to be\nwinning, and federal funding for\nAids programs is expected to be\neliminated in 1998.\nThe week-long conference will\nbe the biggest in a series of global\nseries of Aids gatherings, drawing\n15,000 researchers, people with\nAids, activists, policymakers and\njournalists.\n\"We have our first glimmers of\nhope in a long time,\" conference\nco-chair Dr Martin Schechter told\nreporters.\n\"We are beginning to have the\ntools within our grasp to be able to\nstart to chip away at this problem, if\nwe are given the resources and\ncommitments we need from government\nand people around the\nworld,\" he said.\nEven before the official start of\nthe conference, the streets, storefronts,\nconference halls' and arts\ncentres were filled with events\nranging from gay film festivals, to\ncommemorations for the dead, to'\nforums of activists and grassroots\ncommunity workers from around\nthe world. The events were aiming\nto add their voices and concerns to\nthe more official proceedings.\n\"We don't need another declaration.\nWhat we need is effective implementation,\"\na group of 500 activists\nfrom around the world\ncalling itself Community Forum 96\ndeclared in a statement, asking that\nAids be treated as a human rights issue\nas well as a medical problem.\n(Agencies) \n\nMr Chretien: Skipped meeting\nover protest fears"}
