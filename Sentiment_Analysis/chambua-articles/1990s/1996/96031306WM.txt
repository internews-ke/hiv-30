{"text": "Was it planned or a coincidence?\nBY MARGARETTA wa GACHERU \nWas it planned that all\nthree major productions\nthat premiered\nthis past weekend in Nairobi's theatres\nwere about gutsy women who\ndared to branch out beyond conventional\nroles?\nOr could it be that all three\ntroupes simply scheduled their\nopening nights to coincide with the International Women's Day?\nWhether Miujiza, Phoenix' or\nNairobi City Players had the Women's Day in mind or not, what's significant\nis that Plague, Groping\nfor Words and Big Maggie all focus\non the way three extremely different\nwomen cope with some of\nthe major issues of our times, be it\nthe Aids pandemic, the plight of the\nilliterate or the economic emancipation\nof women.\nWhat's also significant is that despite\neach show being set in a different\nlocale - Plague in rural\nAfrica, Big Maggie in rural Ireland\nand Groping in London's inner\ncity - all three leading ladies\nrefuse lives of self-pity and subordination and choose instead to 'Utilise\nthe resources at hand to chart\nout new paths; irrespective of the\nrisks involved.\nNot that Janet Juma (Caroline\nOdongo) asked to join the fight\nagainst the HIV virus. If her spouse\nBin Broker (Cajeton Boy) hadn't\nleft her alone and strapped with\nthree kids, she might not have taken\nthe only Government job available\n pushing pills and condoms as a.\nfamily life education officer.\nBut by the time, Broker returns\nhome (with Aids) to die, Janet is no  just tough and uncompromising towards\nher 'ex'; she's also fiercely\ncommitted to the cause of stemming\nthe tide of the Aids 'plague'.\nMeja Mwangi, who we know\nbest as a novelist, is a surprisingly\npowerful playwright as we discover\nwith Miujiza Aidscap Players' first\nfull-length production. In Plague,\nhe lift, the Aids issue way beyond\nthe didactic so that one's deeply\nmoved by the dilemma Janet's\npeople must confront. There in\nCrossroads we see villagers struggling to cope with a snowballing\ndeath rate and outmoded attitudes\nthat would constantly slap Janet in .\nthe face.\nYet despite the constant abuses\n_ from her Cucu (Ciiku), the\nHeadmaster (Packson Ngugi) and\neven her own sister (Janet Achieng)\n_ .Janet carries on, aided by a\nschoolboy' (Charles Kiarie) and\nFrank (Nicholas Njagee). The arrival\nof her 'ex' after 10 years' absence\nwould nearly cause havoc to\nher life.\nInstead, what we see is remarkable\nacting, especially from Cajeton\nBoy who's very persuasive\nplaying a dying man who, at last begins\nto think of someone else besides\nhimself.\nBut if Janet's been toughened up\nafter 10 years of desertion, Big\nMaggie who was .more than 20\nyears with her besotten spouse before\nhe. died, is more than twice as\nembittered and spiteful as Janet.\nIn fact,' Maggie is' so tough that\nMargaret Curran's fierce and fiery\nperformance as the merciless Irish\nmatriarch might shock some theatre\ngoers who, will have rarely seen\nsuch female ferocity. And yet, Curran's unprecedented\nperformance is something awesome\nto behold, and not simply because\nshe dares to be so brazen,\nbrash and unbending even towards\nher own daughter!, and sons; but\nalso because Maggie's vehemence\n:begins to' make sense once John Keane's incredible script unfolds.\nFor like Janet, Maggie is a fighter, only Janet's cause might look\nmore just than Maggie's who seems\nto only be fighting for herself. Yet\nshe is fighting for a principle too.\nFor after slaving away all those\nyears in the family shop and on their farm, she refuses to sign them\nover to her sons.\nBut that's just a fraction of Maggie's\nfiercely unfeminine un-orthodoxy! Having been ,offended from\nday one of her marriage, when her\nhusband \u00b7first failed to bend her will,\nMaggie's many humiliations endured all those years have taught never to be exploited again.\nAll four of them will be taught\nharsh lessons by Maggie. Nonetheless,\nMaggie's last monologue will\nmake everything plain: That her\nwar has also been with\u00b7 a Church\nthat had colluded with the state (up\nuntil this year) to deny spouses the\nlegal right to divorce,\nBottom line, what Big Maggie's\nAll about is spiritual and material\nfreedom, and one woman's war for\npersonal liberty .\nGroping with Words is tame\ncomparison to Maggie and\nPague, first because illiteracy is a\nmore illusive issue, second because\nJoyce Chambers (Wendy Penrose)\nmiddle Class, a housewife whose\nmoral indignation compels her to\nrise above complacency and tackle\nthe issue as best. she can, by trying\nto teach adult literacy.\nYet if Joyce is softer than either\nMaggie or Janet, she's still engaged\nIn a war and the casualties are her\nstudents, played by Caroline Dixon,\nnewcomer Darren McMorran and\nJames Ward (who doubled as Director).\nJoyce, like Maggie and Janet is\nalso grappling with ignorance, not\nonly as it's manifest in her student:\nand the educational system that\nspews out illiterates after educating\nthem for 11 years, but also in a society\nand a spouse that doesn't see,\nwhy a privileged woman like Joyce\n.would want do something meaningful with her life.\nWendy Penrose's Joyce may not have the 'guts' of a Maggie or the\ndo-or-die stamina of Janet Juman\nbut Ms Penrose's performances get\nbetter by the day.\nMargaret Curran stars in Big Maggie by Nairobi City Players currently on at the National Theatre.

She does\nnot let me talk to boys or even go\nanywhere near them. She\ndoesn't accept the fact that I am\na teenager and that I must be interested\nin boys. Why should\nmothers be over-protective? I\njust wish they would let teenagers\ndo what they feel is right\nfor them?\nYours, \"sick girl\". \nDear Amani,\nI am a 16-year-old girl in Form\nTwo. I have a problem with my\nmother which I hope you will\nsolve. Since I joined Form One,\nher behaviour towards me has\nchanged. She says that I should\nnot move with any, boy. Boys fear\nto approach me because they\nfear my mother. Amani, please\nwhat will I do to make my mother\nunderstand that I need a man?\nPlease advice before my education\nis affected.\nYours sincerely, D.K.J.\nDear sick girl and O.K.J,\nThank you for writing to Amani.\nYour concerns are common\namong girls of your age. It happens\nthat at puberty, changes occur\nin familial relationships. Most\ngirls begin to perceive themselves\nas mature adults capable of making\nadult decisions. Their parents\non the other hand still look at them\nas their little daughters - babies.\nDuring this period, girls tend to\nspend less time with their parents\nand more with .their peers. The\nemotional distance between parents,\nadolescents, especially\nmothers increases. Girls also tend\nto' yield less to their parents in decision-making, and tend to rely more on their peers.\nConflicts between mothers and\ndaughters seem more pronounced\nduring this time and more due to\nsocial factors.\nMothers usually begin to give\norders to their daughters not to socialise\nwith boys, as indicated in\nyour letters. What needs to be understood is\nthat the underlying\nfactors behind all these are the\nmother's fears, anxieties and worries about what could happen to\nher daughter. Remember, your.\nmother was a teenager once and\nshe knows what it is like to be one,\nand she is aware of some of the\nconsequences of sex at such an\nearly age. These include: Unwanted\nor unplanned pregnancies, sexually\ntransmitted diseases (STD),\nespecially Aids, being barren, early\nschool drop-out, and emotional\nand psychological problems.\nIt is known that young people are\nincapable of forming stable relationships\nbecause they are emotionally\nunstable. For these reasons\nand more, your mother is\nacting as a protector over you\nwhich you are resentful of and feel\nthat she is not sensitive to your\nneeds. What would be helpful is your mother guiding you with information and advice about how\nto regulate your behaviour with boys. I expect that she would prefer you to postpone sexual activity\nuntil marriage. However, you need to understand that sex is such a taboo subject for her to discuss: She is unprepared to talk about it. Instead, what happens is that she wants to control your life in relation to boys/men by giving what may be orders to you. It is also very common that girls talk less to\ntheir mothers, and fathers are not willing to talk about sexuality to their daughters, so a void in communion is felt and girls are left at a loss.\nI suggest that you find a way to discuss\nwith your mother your feelings and she might be willing to discuss her fears with you. With open \ncommunication you could\nwork out together how you can\nbest relate to boys because not all boy/girl\nrelationships end up in sexual\nactivity and I feel that is what worries\nmothers most.\nAmani regrets that due to the\nlarge volume of correspondence\nwe receive, it is not always possible\nto answer each letter individually."}
