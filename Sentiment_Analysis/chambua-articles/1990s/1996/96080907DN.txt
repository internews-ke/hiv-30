{"text": "Educate youth on Aids danger\nI was moved by a letter titled \"Lament\nof an HIV sufferer\" -which\nwas published in the Nation of\nJuly 27..\nI fully agree with the sentiments\nexpressed by the girl who blamed\n,her parents for not warning her\nabout the dangers of sex before she\ncontracted the deadly disease ..\nMany of the HIV-virus carriers'\nare not necessarily promiscuous\npeople as the public tends to\nbelieve.\nThese are just normal people, especially\nyoung men and women\nwho were misled by their peer\n. groups and sugar daddies.\nMost parents, say more than 90\nper cent, do not talk to their teenage\nchildren about sex. All they ever do\nis to caution them about it without\nexplaining why.\nIt is because of this that many\nteenagers get curious and wish to\ndiscover it for themselves and end\nup either contracting the common\nSexually Transmitted Diseases or\nworse.\nThis is because sex is shrouded\nin mystery in our society. The consequences\nof this have been devastating\nas the sad tale of the HIV positive\ngirl attests ..\n: I fully support the screening of\nthe television commercials on safe\n:'sex which .were relayed during the\n'recent European Cup soccer finals\n,held in England ...\nA number Of young people consider\nsex as something to indulge in\n:regardless of whether one is married\nor not. That should not be the\ncase.\nHowever, those suffering from.\nAids also should not be' treated like\nsocial outcasts. They are human beings\nwho need support and love like\neveryone else. That is the message one.\nof the commercials conveyed.\nI do not like the KBC adverts on\nAids. They show that all the people\nwith Aids either got it while attending dubious parties and discos .or\n'just having casual or commercial\nsex with sugar daddies. They all\ndemoralise people suffering from\nthe disease by showing graves.\nThe Kenyan media should come\nup with something as good as the\nEuropean Community commercials\non safe sex.\nThis way, they will help the society\nto change their attitude towards\nsex and their behaviour ..\nHIV-Positive Young Girl.\nMachakos. \n\nPreach morals\nnot condoms\nI disagree with Elijah Bosire\nNyairo's remarks in a letter titled\n\"TV adverts on condoms vital,\"\nwhich was published in the Nation\nof July 23.\nHe implied that we should admit\nthat we cannot\u00b7 control ourselves\nand obtain condoms so that we can\nhave free sex any time., I hope he\nknows that unlike animals; we cannot control our instincts.\nAnd as Christians, we have the\n10 Commandments to guide us.\nThe sixth one. covers sex and emphasises\nthat it should not be\n, abused as it is sacred and should be\n.used only for procreation.\n.The. writer is like many others\nmisguided about Aids and\ncondoms. Condoms are not entirely\nsafe as they have pores that can let\nin the HIV virus. Those who use\ncondoms should not forget this.\nWe should promote morals and\nnot condoms as self-control and\nstrict adherence to morals are the\nonly, not the so-called \"safe sex.\"\nE.W.
