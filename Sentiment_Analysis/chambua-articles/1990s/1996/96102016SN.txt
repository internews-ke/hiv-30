{"text": "Towards the ultimate Aids control blue-print\n\nBy CIUGU MWAGIRU\nMore than a decade after the first Aids case was identified in Kenya, the epidemic continues to blaze a trail of death and destruction that threatens to tear apart the social and economic fabric of the country, leaving a desolate national landscape in its wake.\nThis is the scenario painted by researchers in a book launched on Thursday by Vice-President George Saitoti.\nThe book, Aids in Kenya: Socio-Economic Impact and Policy Implications, was published with the assistance of the United States Agency for International Development in collaboration with the Aids Control and Prevention Project, AIDSCAP, and Family Health International, among other agencies.\nThe study, described by the WHO local representative, Dr Paul Chuke, as the most thorough so far in the, African region, is expected to jolt different sectors of Kenyan society out of the relative ambivalence and lethargy with which they have hither to reacted to matters related to the Aids pandemic.\nPut together by a team of researchers that approached the task from a multisectoral perspective which reflects the fact that the scourge has wreaked havoc across a wide spectrum of social and economic strata-in the country, the study depicts Kenya as a cc1Untryvirtually under siege from the Aids menace.\nThe dire straits predicted for the future should the pandemic's meteoric rise continue, unchecked are brought into focus, with the hope that the pathos that Aids spreads across society will mobilise the individual and collective wills of Kenyans to rise in combat against the scourge.\nInsisting that reticence and apathy in any quarters are simply suicidal given the glaring and chilling realities of the Aids challenge, the researchers point out that however frightening available statistics on the epidemic are, they are, in fact, not entirely accurate, given the fact that reported cases of infection are only the tip of the iceberg, because many cases go unreported and undiagnosed.\nStill, the researchers point out that out of an estimated 20 million Aids cases in the world - among them 18.5 million adults and 1.5 million children child - more than one million are to be found in Kenya, which makes the country one of the hardest hit in the world.\nThe diversity of the consequences has been unnerving, and the way forward in the battle against the epidemic seems to be hazy indeed, a fact that calls for a change of attitude in all social sectors.\nPointing out that strategies to counter the rapidly growing Aids menace should be mapped collectively, the researchers say the epidemic can no longer be viewed as affecting only the afflicted individuals.\nRather, it should be viewed as threatening and actually beginning to lay waste the social units that have traditionally held society together, beginning with the family. Indeed, the study underscores the fact that adult deaths resulting from Aids-related complications are not an accurate indicator of the real havoc' the epidemic is causing across different strata of society. On the contrary, the real impact in social and economic terms can only be gauged using parameters that take stock of those who feel the pinch and have to live with the unnerving challenges of shouldering new responsibilities as a result of losing breadwinners to Aids.\nIt is pointed out that the living standards of families are dramatically lowered by Aids-related deaths, given that the majority of victims fall when at the peak of their productivity. The result is that old relatives and children are left with the burden of charting new survival strategies, a daunting task given the harsh economic realities of our times.\nThe already alarming harshness of the economic climate prevailing in the country is aggravated by the fact that corporate bodies are threatened by retrogression as a result of constantly losing expensively produced skilled and semi-skilled manpower as a result of Aids.\nAs the researchers point out, losses in the commercial sector run into millions of shillings, affecting both the profitability and productivity of businesses. This scenario points to an economic future fraught with threats of stagnation and, most likely, utter retrogression.\nWhat is even more frightening is the fact that the Aids challenge has a phantom nature, with many unseens. For instance, it is estimated that although 63,000 Aids cases were reported by the end of 1995, the estimate of infections represented, only about a quarter of all actual Aids cases.\nUndiagnosed or unreported cases are, according to the writers of the present study, by far more than identified ones, and it is pointed out that the 1995 estimate represents only about five per cent of all HIV infections in Kenya.\nThe spread of Aids has transcended social, economic and age barriers, although women and the the youth seem to be more greatly threatened by the alarming growth of the menace. It is pointed out, for instance, that the seroprevalence rate among pregnant women in some urban areas ranges from 20 to 30 per cent, a telling development given that the HIV prevalence rate among adults in general was about seven per cent in 1994, having risen from 3.5 per cent in 1990.\nThe obvious implications of the high prevalence rates among expectant mothers, easy to chart because of increased prenatal testing for Aids, are that Aids infection among adults in general is on the rise.\nThis rise, the research points out, is steadily becoming a gallop that could see 1.8 million Kenyans infected with the Aids virus in 2000.\nTo avoid this eventuality, a comprehensive set of interventions is called for, and both policy setters and policy influencers from all sectors are expected to rise to the challenge. It is agreed that there is an urgent need to broaden the understanding of the threat of Aids, which challenge in turn calls for an urgent change of both behaviour and attitudes across the board.\nAmong beleaguered policy makers, the greatest dilemma involves the question of how to set priorities in the allocation of resources.\nFor instance, the question arises whether the prevention of Aids should take precedence over the provision of better general health care facilities, water and shelter for the general population.\nIn the past; the absence of a clear policy on Aids has made movement forward in the fight against it difficult. But an expected Sessional Paper on the disease may soon change things, and the researchers point out that there is hope for new monitoring and regulatory guidelines for the Government.\nIn the meantime, the epidemic continues to affect sectors of society that have nothing to do with the sexual risks associated with Aids. Among the most affected are about 333,000 children under the age of 15 who have lost their parents to the scourge. This number is expected to rise unless drastic measures are taken to curb the spread of Aids.\nThe collapse of traditional social support structures has resulted in many Kenyan households being headed by children as young as 10 years. Such children, over whelmed by new challenges facing them, often turn to the streets for survival, often turning to prostitution and becoming vulnerable to HIV infection themselves.\nThe rise in the number of Aids orphans has in turn resulted in a lack of basic necessities for survival, and many children consequently have no access to food, shelter and clothing. In addition, health care and education are denied these children, with the result that not only will educational goals be thwarted, but there will be a dramatic rise in child mortality rates unless the spread of Aids is curbed.\nThe strain on national economic resources has become so severe as to almost paralyse the health sector and threaten to bite chunks off the national budget. With the cost of treating patients with Aids ranging between Sh23,000 and Sh43,000 the provision of other services is set to become a gargantuan task for the Government.\nThe researchers also point out that infection rates are higher in the rural areas, where monitoring and health care facilities are limited.\nThe result is that rural populations are virtually left at the mercy of the scourge, which points out the stark rural-urban economic variables and their consequences.\nThe micro- and macro-economic implications of the spread of Aids are not only seen as stretching the country's health budget, but also seriously compromising both economic growth and new investments.\nApart from governmental intervention in terms of policy formulation and intervention to counter the threat of Aids, the new study calls for a diversity of other measures to combat the spread of the disease.\nAmong them are changes in traditional and social attitudes which militate against Aids prevention.\nAt the general population level, access to information is seen as a priority measure in the war against Aids, as is education on how to avoid contracting the virus. The private sector's role in the provision of such information is underscored, and a multi-disciplinary approach to curbing Aids suggested as the most appropriate if the looming dangers are to be avoided.\nThe final conclusion of the present study seems to be that there is need to adopt a \"we're in this together\" attitude if the spread of Aids is to be sufficiently contained.\nThe new book, copies of which are available free of charge from the publishers on request, begins to chart the way towards a blue print for checking the spread of Aids. \n\nDelegates to an International Conference on Aids listen attentively to the speaker:  There are an estimated one million cases of Aids in Kenya, which makes the country one of the hardest-hit in the world. -File Picture"}
