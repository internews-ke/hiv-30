{"text": "Statistics vital in Aids war \u2013 WHO\nProper -records on HIV/Aids infections should be expanded to help address the scourge's problem, the World Health Organisation's Country Representative, Dr Paul' Chuke, says. \"Kenya is fairly advanced in this respect. The surveillance system instituted by the Ministry of Health with support from the WHO is efficient\", Dr Chuke said.\nSpeaking at the launching of a book on Aids titled, Aids: Understanding the Challenge, by Raphael Tuju, at a Nairobi hotel, Dr Chuke said the WHO's latest collation puts the cumulative total of Aids cases worldwide at 1,291,810 as of December last year.\nBut under-reporting by a factor of three has been estimated, thus putting the estimated total at just under 4.5 million, he said.\nThe WHO estimated that 17 million adults globally were living with HIV infection at the end of 1994, 65 per cent (II million) in sub-Saharan Africa.\nAids was making a socio-economic impact unparalleled by other diseases, even those with greater incidence and much worse annual fatality rates.\nHe pointed out that malaria was still the greatest in incidence, with an annual incidence of more than 300 million and a million deaths.\nTuberculosis kills three million people worldwide every year, Dr Chuke said.\nBut unlike these' diseases, which are non- selective among the population, Aids selects those in the prime of life.\nThrough mother-child transmission, he said, it denied over one-third of newborns whose mothers have HIV the chance to grow up and develop their talents.\nDr Chuke said proper information. Education and communication are important weapons against the disease.\nHe said Mr Tuju's book will make good reading for all.\n\"It advises you on how to keep healthy and continue to make remarkable contributions to society. It helps you postpone the acquisition of the troubling symptoms of Aids and also tells you how to seek help\", he said.\nMr Tuju said the book is an enquiry at a personal level in obtaining \"more explanations of why Aids is hitting us badly\".\n\"We need to enquire more and try to have a deeper understanding of the aspects of our society which make us so vulnerable to this disease\", MrTuju said. \nMr Tuju dismissed as simplistic the oft-repeated statement that widow inheritance contributes to the spread of HIV.\nThe book gives insight into several challenges brought about by Aids, among them the challenge of protecting \"ourselves and those dear to us from this dreadful infection\".\nAmong those present were Kisumu Rural MP Prof Anyang' Nyong'o, Daily Nation Managing Editor Tom Mshindi and International Planned Parenthood Federation Official Dorothy Nyong'o"}
