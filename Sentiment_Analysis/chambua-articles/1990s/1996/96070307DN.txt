{"text": "Probe Aids-laced condoms claim\nProfessor Arthur Obel of the Pearl\nOmega drug controversy was on\nJune I reported in the Nation as\nsaying that condoms sent to the developing\ncountries were laced with\nthe Aids virus,\nThree years ago, a friend, who\nwas a student in Nairobi University's\nDentistry Department, made a\nsimilar claim.\nSince these claims have been\nmade by people who should know\nwhat they are talking about, they\nshould be seriously investigated. If\nthe condoms are indeed laced with\n'HIV virus, many people in the\nThird World are going to get infected.\nIn the mid 1980s, a man reportedly\nobtained a bank loan when he\nlearnt that he was HIV positive. He\nthen went around luring schoolgirls\nfor sex, saying he did not wish to\ndie alone.\nA local magazine also reported\nin March that a woman similarly\nmaliciously infected many people\nwith the virus. However, the claim\nthat all condoms are laced with the HIV virus smacks of more fantasy\nthan fact.\nBut perhaps, Prof Obel should\nanswer the following:  \nIn which countries did he\nperform his tests? \nHas he published the results of\nthe tests of Aids-laced condoms in\nany journal?\nDoes he have samples of such\ncondoms and can his claims be verified\nby an independent party? \nDoes he have electromicrographs\nof the virus samples he isolated\nfrom the condoms? \nWhat about the condoms\nmade in the Third World, and they\nalso laced with the virus?\nWhat seems to raise doubts is his\nclaim that all condoms from the\nWest have the Aids virus. How did\nthe manufacturers of all these\ncondoms agree to lace those destined\nfor the Third World with the\nHIV virus?\nWas Prof Obel trying to scare\npeople? \nHarrison Murbi.\nNakuru."}
