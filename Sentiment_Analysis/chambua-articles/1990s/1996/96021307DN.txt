{"text": "HIV: Circumscion claim false\nMr Kibocha Stanley of Naro Moru\nended his letter published in the\nNation of February 9. with this\nstatement: \"Of late. it has become\nclear that circumcised men have\nless chances of contracting the\nHIV/Aids Virus,\" Is this a hypothesis\nor is this statement backed by\nstatistics and research findings'!\nWhen and where was the research\ncarried out'? Who carried out the\nresearch'!\nThe facts are as follows:\nCircumcision is a cultural\npractice carried out mainly in\nAfrica and the Middle East by some\ncommunities. The rest of mankind\nliving in America (North and\nSouth), Europe and Asia do not circumcise\ntheir males as a cultural\npractice.\nThe majority of mankind. by far.\ncome from the non-circumcising\ncommunities.\nThe rate of HIV infection is\nmuch higher in Africa compared to the continents where circumcision\nis not a cultural practice.\nConsidering Mr Kibocha's statement.\none would have expected the\nrate of HIV infection in Africa.\nwhere the majority of ethnic communities\ncircumcise their male. to\nbe much lower than. for example.\nEurope. Yet statistics show the opposite.\nAllegations such as those by Mr\nKibocha. if not countered, would\nmislead the people and have adverse\neffects.\nPromiscuity. careless and unprotected\nsex would become prevalent\namong the communities who circumcise\ntheir males. thereby increasing\nHIV infection.\nThe non-circumcising communities\nwould be stigmatised as potential\nHIV carriers.\nMr Kibocha's claim amounts to\nethnic arrogance.
