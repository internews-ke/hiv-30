{"text": "Town life may raise\nHIV cases\nVANCOUVER, Thursday\nDevelopment that lures young\npeople from rural villages has contributed\nto the spread of the Aids virus\nin poor nations with the least\nmoney to offer treatment, experts\nsaid here yesterday.\nSpeaking at the 11th International\nConference on Aids, Dr Josef\nDecosas, a Canadian expert on development\nand Aids, likened the\nepidemic to the spread of another\nsexually transmitted disease, syphilis,\nin the centuries when It was incurable.\nAs with syphilis, migration of\nyoung people from rural areas relatively\nfree of HIV to the big cities,\nwhere it is rife, has led to a leap in\nthe number of people who carry the\nvirus that causes acquired immune\ndeficiency syndrome (Aids).\nDr Decosas cited the example of\nan area near the huge Akosombo\nsouth Ghana where 10 per cent\npregnant women tested positive\nfor HIV, significantly higher\nthan the one to four per cent in the\nrest of the nation.\nWhat happened was massive\nnumbers of women forced from\ntheir homes in the 1960s by the\nmassive lake created by the dam\nwent into prostitution.\nPoor countries that eschew development,\nhowever, are also vulnerable\nto HIV, he said.\n\"The risk of countries to suffer\nserious, stable HIV epidemics is\nclearly not equal,\" he said.\nOne problem in poor countries is\nthat other sexually transmitted diseases,\nsuch as gonorrhea, often go\nuntreated.\nThe lesions they cause offer an\neasy entry point for the HIV when\nthe person is exposed.\nGlobally 90 per cent of the 22\nmillion people with Aids or HIV\nlive in the developing world, and in\nsome pockets one-third of the adult\npopulation has the virus.\nMs Connie Osborne, a lecturer\nand pediatrician at the University of\nZambia's School of Medicine, said\nthat Lusaka's health care network\nwas inundated by people with Aids.\n\"Around 65 per cent of adult ...\ninpatients in Lusaka are HIV seropositive,\"\nshe said ..\nShe estimated that between 80,\n000 and 200,000 people in Zambia\nwere HIV positive. That's five percent\nof people in the countryside\nand 34 per cent in the cities, she\nsaid.\nBut Zambia's hospitals, like\nmost in Africa where the Aids epidemic took hold in the late 1970s and early 1980s, have little or no\nhope to offer Aids patients.\nMeanwhile, suicide is a common\nway out for people with Aids, especially\nin the final days of their disease,\ndoctors from Europe and\nNorth America said yesterday.\nBotched suicide attempts are frequent\nbecause physician-assisted suicide\nis illegal in most places,\nsaid reports from the United States,\nCanada, England and the Netherlands\nat the conference.\nNonetheless, the evidence suggests\ndoctors and nurses are often- willing to break the law to relieve\nsuffering.\nMore than half of Aids doctors in\na San Francisco survey, for example,\nadmitted they wrote prescriptions\nfor overdoses of narcotics to\nhelp their patients commit suicide.\n\"Inhibitions are loosening,\"\nsaid Dr Thomas Mitchell, a public health\nspecialist of the University\nof California, San Francisco. \"Physicians\nare accepting assisted suicide\nmore than in the past.\"\nDr Mitchell surveyed 228 members\nof a San Francisco area group\nof Aids specialists. Half of them returned\nanonymous questionnaires,  and 53 per cent of these doctors said\nthey had helped patients commit\nsuicide by writing prescriptions for\nnarcotic overdoses.\n\"Everyone knows this occurs,\nbut there has been no quantifiable data\non it.\" said Dr Mitchell.\nA similar survey five years earlier\ndid not ask doctors whether they\nhad helped with a suicide. At that\ntime, the question was considered\ntoo sensitive.\nBut when asked how they would\nreact to a hypothetical case of patient\nsuffering, 28 per cent said then\nthey would probably help.\n(Agencies)\nChildren march to put across the message that Aids kills. Experts have warned that sexually transmitted\ndiseases (STD) increase chances of contracting Aids. (File picture)\n\nDrug costs worry the poor\nVANCOUVER, Thursday\nFor delegates from the Third\nWorld, where most of the world's\nHIV-infected people live, the expensive\nscientific successes trumpeted\nat this week's conference border\non being a cruel joke.\nFifteen years after the pandemic\nbegan ravaging the globe, optimism\nabounds among bow tied researchers\nand pharmaceutical company\nrepresentatives from rich nations\nthat new combination drug therapies\ncan at last make Aids a treatable\ndisease.\nThe tragedy for developing\nnations- home to 90 per cent of\nthe 21.8 million people infected\nwith HIV - is that these expensive\ntreatments are out of the reach of\nthe poor.\n\"Before we were hoping together\nthat there would be a solution,\"\nsaid Dr Lieve Fransen of the European\nCommission's Aids\nprogramme for developing\ncountries.\n\"Now there are scientific breakthroughs\nthat bring people apart\neconomically and politically.\"\nIn the United States, \"cocktails\"\nof the latest drugs, known as protease\ninhibitors with more traditional\nmedicines like AZT, can cost upwards\nof $15,000 per person per\nyear- many times the per capita\ngross annual income of Aids sufferers\nin the developing world.\n(Reuter)\nSTD control vital battle against Aids spread\nVANCOUVER, Thursday\nCommon sense says than on trolling sexually transmitted\ndiseases will help restrain the spread of Aids.\nBut now scientists are learning that the link - and\nthe promise it holds for Aids prevention - is even\nstronger than anyone thought. .\nDoctors know that people who have a sexually transmitted disease (STD), like syphilis, chancroid or herpes,\nare more vulnerable to Aids. Many STD create\nsores or lesions that are like welcome signs for the HIV\nvirus looking to make its devastating way into the body.\nNow doctors are learning that HIV-infected people\nwho have STD may also be more infectious to others.\nMen may have a more concentrated dose of the HIV virus\nin their semen. Women \"shed\" or release more\nHIV virus in their genital secretions.\nControlling these diseases, and thus helping chip\naway at the spread of the HIV virus, has been one of the\nhopeful threads running through the conference.\nTreating STD is relatively inexpensive, and a skill\nthat health workers even in remote corners of the globe\ncan learn. Costly lab tests are not necessarily a requirement.\nThe symptoms can be obvious.\nAccording to Dr Judith Wasserheit, a researcher at\nthe US Centres for Disease Control (CD), studies from\naround the world indicate that people with STD have a\ntwo to five-fold increased risk of contracting the human\n.immunodeficiency virus that causes Aids. (Reuter)\n\nActivists out\nto show doctors\nthe right path\nVANCOUVER, Thursday\nThey are opinionated and disrespectful. They interrupt\nlearned speakers and waylay prominent doctors. But\nthe Aids activists attending the 11th International Conference\non Aids know what they are talking about.\n\"If you want to stay alive, you learn a lot. I found it's\nbetter to learn all about it myself and make my own decisions,\"\nsaid Mr Jeff Arender, a 35-year-old Aids activist\nfrom San Diego.\n\"Aids has changed the face of medicine forever.\nDoctors with ego problems - you used to just do what\nthe doctor said.\" Not any more.\nHealthy and suntanned, Mr Arender has been HIV positive\nfor II years and was diagnosed with Aids last\nyear. And while he has a supply of Aids medications\nsitting on his dresser at home, he has never touched a\nsingle pill. Mr Arender, who is unemployed, spent\n$1,352 - he is very precise about the amount- on a\nmonth's worth of \"cocktail\" therapy using AZT, 3TC\n(Epivir) and indinavir (Crixivan). Although his immune\nsystem is under attack, he feels well and does not\nthink he needs them - yet. \"I want to save it for when I\nreally need it,\" he said.\nPeople with Aids dislike the phrase Aids victim.\n\"This epidemic has transformed the way we deal with\nhealth care forever,\" Mr Velez added. \"We are too\nsmart and we are too totally without shame about embarrassing\nsomebody.\" (Reuter)"}
