{"text": "Public figures must tackle Aids scourge\n\nIn his formal message on the occasion of the 44th anniversary of\nKenyatta Day yesterday, President Moi reminded Kenyans that\nthe day is celebrated \"in honour of our fallen heroes and the\npioneers of this nation\". In his off-the-cuff Kiswahili remarks,\nthe Head of State reminded the nation of other much more recently\nfallen - and still falling - Kenyans, the thousands who\nhave succumbed to the medical holocaust of the incurable Acquired\nImmuno-Deficiency Syndrome (Aids), a catastrophe\nthat may have killed more Kenyans than died throughout the\nMau Mau war and stands to kill tens of thousands more. President\nMoi warned that an entire generation could be lost to the\ndisease.\nThis was a rare departure from exclusively political matters\nand a welcome commentary from the political chief executive\non a subject about which Kenyans rarely hear from members of\nthe national leadership. In fact, all Kenyans hear about Aids\nnowadays is from statisticians and paramedics, and both these\ngroups are congenitally incapable of popularising their message,\nhowever dire and urgent it is.\nTheir communication skills are hampered by closed-circuit\nprofessional jargon and shop-talk in which, for instance, one\nhears of\" 16.5 adults and 1.5 children\" and of a bewildering array\nof fatal ailments that are somehow all linked to HIV/Aids,\nthough how is rarely made intelligible to even the reasonably\nwell-educated layman and -woman.\nIt is a matter of the first importance that the public be sensitised\nto the Aids scourge and its implications through every\navailable forum and public figure. All those personalities who\nhog so much media space and air-time, would do this country a\ngreat public service if they used their articulation, advocacy and\ncommunication skills to tell Kenyans in readily understandable\nterms of the dangers of Aids and of preventive - for there are\nno curative - measures as well as how to care for the afflicted.\nIn the West, royalty, film-, music- and sports superstars have\nall been deployed to great effect in the media to spread Aids\ncare and prevention awareness messages. From Princess Diana\nto Elizabeth Taylor, the West's celebrities are pictured in the\nmedia hugging Aids victims and presiding over HIV charities.\nLet us hear the rest of the political leadership in this country\ntake up this most urgent of issues and talk some 'positive self preservation\nsense to Kenyans."}
