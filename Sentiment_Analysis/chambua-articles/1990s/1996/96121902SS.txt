{"text": "THURSDAY, DECEMBER 19, 1996\n\nFamily planning saves lives\n\nBy a Correspondent\u2028\nMrs Mukiki (not her real name) comes\u2028\nfrom a middle class background in one\u2028\nof Kenya rural areas. In primary\u2028\nschool, she is not informed of family\u2028\nlife education. The only thing she\u2028\nlearns is that \u2018women bleed when raped. When 12\u2028\nyears old, one morning, she gets concerned when\u2028\nshe finds herself wet with blood.\u2028\nA few months later, she attends a friend\u2019s birth\u2028\nday party. Here, she meets a boy with whom she\u2028\ndevelops a relationship.\u2028\nTwo years later, she visits the boy at his home to\u2028\nhelp her with her homework.\u2028\nThe boy rapes her. A few weeks later, she notices\u2028\nthat her clothes are getting smaller.\u2028\nShe starts wondering what is happening to her\u2028\nbody. She does not know what to do and whom to\u2028\ngo to. Her parents gel concerned about her weight\u2028\ngain.\u2028\nOne morning, she is taken to hospital in pain. She\u2028\ndevelops fits and delivers a dead baby. She has in\u2028\njury to her reproductive organs and as a result, urine\u2028\nflows freely, uncontrollable.\u2028\n[1er condition slightly improves and she is dis\u2028\ncharged but she has permanent epilepsy as a result\u2028\nof pregnancy and is a social outcast due to the urine\u2028\nsmell.\u2028\nLuckily, because her parents can afford it, they\u2028\nget a doctor and the girl is treated but her epilepsy\u2028\nremains. She goes back to school and completes her\u2028\nsecondary education.\u2028\nAt the age of 20, she is married to Mr, Muloki.\u2028\nThe religious background at her marital home does\u2028\nnot allow her to use modern methods of family\u2028\nplanning, but can only use natural methods.\u2028\nHer husband works away from home and goes\u2028\nhome once in a while whenever he gets an opportunity. Mrs. Muloki finds herself pregnant every year\u2028\nbecause she cannot refuse to meet her husband during the occasions he visits.\u2028\nDuring her fourth pregnancy, she s very weak.\u2028\nHer newborn gets marasmus and dies while her\u2028\nthird horn gets kwashiorkor and also dies.\u2028\nMrs. Muloki gets pregnant soon after but when\u2028\nshe is about to deliver, she starts bleeding at home.\u2028\nShe is taken to hospital and she\u2019s diagnosed to\u2028\nhave a ruptured uterus due to frequent pregnancies.\u2028\nShe dies on the operating table.\u2028\nMr Muloki is left with two small children. He\u2028\nmarries another wife to take care of the children but\u2028\nhis new wife wants to have her own children.\u2028\nThe story of Mrs Muloki is one example of the\u2028\nsituations most women find themselves in.\u2028\nOver centuries, a child has been the most treasured component of human kind.\u2028\nIn Africa, a child signifies and is still looked at as\u2028\nhope for continuity of a community (family), insurance in old age and assurance for security against intruders.\nWhen a girl is married, the whole village celebrates. When\u2028she takes along time without showing a sign of pregnancy, the\u2028\nwhole village starts asking questions. However, when she brings\u2028\nforth a child, the whole village\u2028\ncelebrates. Traditionally, there is\u2028\nspecial food for the mother for\u2028\nhaving brought forth a new community member.\u2028\nIn African culture, women\u2028\ntook back stage in decision-making, yet girls and women were\u2028\ngiven a lot of protection as it was\u2028\nrecognised that they assured the community\u2019s Continuity.\u2028\nSex which is key lo propagation is the most dangerous sport.\u2028\nAbout 114 million acts of sexual intercourse take place each\u2028\nday, resulting in 910,000 conceptions and 356,000 sexually transmitted bacteria and \u2018viral infections.\u2028\nIn I 990, the number of women who died from pregnancy-related causes in various countries was\u2028\n227,000 for South Central Asia,\u2028\n56,000 for South East Asia,\u2028\n16,000 for West Asia, 24,000 for\u2028\nEast Asia, 23,000 for Latin\u2028\nAmerica and Caribbean, 1,400 for Oceanic, 4,000 for all developed countries and 235,000 in\u2028\nAfrica.\u2028\nIn all, 586,400 women died from pregnancy-related causes\u2028\nworldwide in 1990.\u2028\nThe World Health Organisation estimates that 650 women\u2028\ndie every year out of 100,000\u2028\npregnant women in Kenya. Since\u2028\nwe know that every year there\nare more than one million pregnancies in Kenya,\u2028\nthe death rate is rather alarming.\u2028\nFurthermore, those who become disabled or suffer other complications are even more than those who die. Worse still, 62 out of every 1,000 children\u2028\nborn in Kenya never live to see their first birth day\u2028\nas a result of pregnancy complications.\u2028\nThis works out to over 57,000 infant deaths even\u2028\nwithout accounting for those who die after one year.\u2028\nFurthermore, an estimated 1,000 to 5,000 Kenyan\u2028\nwomen die annually from abortion and over a quarter of patients with induced abortions are below 19\u2028\nyears old.\u2028\nMortality notwithstanding, over 40 per cent of all documented school girl pregnancies terminate in abortions. \u2028\nAll these ill-health and maternal deaths not to mention the deaths to the newborns, can be averted\u2028\nby use of family planning.\u2028\nWomen are maimed and die due to lack of family\u2028\nplanning and reproductive health care.\u2028\nNo individual, group of individuals, or organisation, has monopoly on morality where human lives\u2028\nand well being are at stake.\u2028\nBetter women alive following sound family planning methods than women who die or remain physically and emotionally crippled due to lack of family\u2028\nplanning or as a result of unsafe pregnancy termination. Fifty million or more abortions are induced\u2028\neach year throughout the world, about half are performed in unsafe circumstances.\u2028\nWith increased knowledge, acceptance and use of\u2028\ncontraceptives, the need for abortion decreases.\u2028\nContraception \u00a1s the first line of defence against\u2028\nan unwanted pregnancy and, hence, illegal abortion.\u2028\nTo prevent the need for a repeat abortion, crucial\u2028\nelements of post-abortion services include good\u2028\ncontraceptive services coupled\nwith supportive and sympathetic\u2028\ncounselling, tailored to be responsive to the woman\u2019s personal circumstances and cultural\u2028\nbackground.\u2028\nThough induced abortion is illegal in Kenya, it is a law which\u2028\nis hard to enforce since most induced abortions took place in\u2028\nback streets.\u2028\nIt reported in Parliament recently that an average of 111 \nKenyans died of Aids daily.\u2028\nIn some parts of the country, as high as 27 out of 100 pregnant\u2028\nwomen are infected with HIV,\u2028\nwhich means that their husbands\u2028\nare already infected and that their\u2028\nnewborns may also be infected.\nArising from the suffering caused by a number of\u2028\nfactors, there is need for family planning which\u2028\nhelps individuals or couples to delay having a child\u2028\nwhen they are not ready and to space between children to give the mother time lo regain her strength \u2028\nand the newborn lime to grow past the risky periods\u2028\nof dying from ailments like marasmus and kwashiorkor.\u2028\nFamily planning also helped couples or\u2028\nindividuals stop unwanted pregnancies altogether\u2028\nwhen they had the number of children they can\u2028\nSupport.\u2028\nThe practice also made relations between partners safe and satisfying by creating a happy home\u2028\nenvironment that is conducive to mutual faithfulness, thereby protecting each other from sexually\u2028\ntransmitted diseases and related infections.\u2028\nStudies have shown that prostitution is a result of\npoverty, lack of love in childhood or dissatisfaction with the\u2028\nhome environment.\u2028\nWith consistent and proper use\u2028\nof family planning barrier method, cancer of the cervix would\u2028\ndiminish.\u2028\nIn Kenya cancer of the cervix\u2028\nrepresents 59 per cent of all genital tract cancers.\u2028\nThrough family planning, such\u2028\nas the use of condoms, the HIV/AIDS - a killer which currently\u2028\ninfects over one million Kenyans \u2014 and other sexually transmitted\u2028\ninfections (which affects even\u2028\nmore Kenyans) can significantly\u2028\ndiminish.\u2028\nIt is important to note that sexually transmitted infections are a\u2028\nleading cause of infertility.\u2028\nSTDs also kill many women\u2028\nthrough ectopic pregnancies.\u2028\nIn Kenya, many young people\u2028\nare infected with Sexually Trans\u2028\nmitted Diseases (STDs).\u2028\nAIDS is increasing most rapidly among persons in their twenties, which means that many\u2028\nAIDS patients contracted the\u2028\nAIDS virus during their adolescence.\u2028\nThrough family life education,\u2028\nchildren who are still innocent\u2028\ncan be counselled to understand\u2028\nthe need to delay getting in\u2028\nvolved in sexual activities.\u2028\nThose who are already involved but have not experienced\u2028\nthe complications, can be helped\u2028\nto understand the dangers involved and consequently correct\u2028\ntheir behaviour.\nOn the other hand, those who\u2028\nhave en involved and suffered the consequences\u2028\nof irresponsible sexual behaviour can be treated and counseled not to repeat similar mistakes.\u2028\nFamily planning is one way of helping those who\u2028\nare not fortunate to have a baby to experience the\u2028\njoy of getting one or assisted on how cope with\u2028\nChildlessness,\u2028\nThere are several benefits of family planning:\u2028\nIt is well established fact that death of a child\u2028\nbefore t is one year old tend to increase with closely space births.\u2028\nThe likelihood of infants dying before their first\u2028\nbirthday is far greater than those born less than one\u2028\nyear at the end of their mother\u2019s last pregnancy\u2028\nthan infants born after a long interval.\u2028\nUsually the child who is followed by the infant is\u2028\nprone to suffer from kwashiorkor due to early\u2028\nweaning from breastfeeding.\u2028\nInfants born to women who already have many\u2028\nbirths are also more likely to die in the first year\u2028\nthan those born to women with fewer children.\u2028\nStudies have shown that after the third or fourth\n- . . \u2014\u2028\nbirth, the risk of infant death and maternal death\u2028\nincrease.\u2028\nIt is, therefore, not surprising that the areas with\u2028\nlow contraceptive prevalence rate have the highest\u2028\ninfant mortality.\u2028\nWorn n who begin their child bearing early are\u2028\nalso more likely to fall into the pattern of having\u2028\nbirths t close together and having larger families\u2028\noverall which is harmful to child\u2019s health and survival an is also associated with higher maternal\u2028\nmortality.\u2028\nIn Kenya, 52 per cent of the 15 to 19-year-olds\u2028\nare sexually active.\u2028\nApproximately, 14,000 births occurred to girl\u2028aged bet4ieeen 15 and 19 which accounted for\u2028\nabout 12 per cent of Kenyans total fertility.\u2028\nThe dangers to both mothers and their children of"}
