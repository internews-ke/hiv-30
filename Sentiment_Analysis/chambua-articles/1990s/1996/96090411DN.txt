{"text": "Child prostitution persists\nOrganizations working to rescue children from sexual exploitation finding that freeing them from\nthe battering and abuse is only part of the battle. Ensuring they stay away from the sex market is another matter.\n\n\"All the efforts to end commercial sexual exploitation of children will not work unless attention is also paid to the recovery of sexually abused children,\" said Mr Amihan Abueva, executive secretary of End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism (ECPAT) campaign based in Bangkok,\nThailand.\n\nYet according to Mr Abueva, not enough programmes have been put in place to help the child victims overcome the damage done by exploitation.\n\nTogether with Unicef, the NGO Group on the Convention on Children's Rights and the Swedish\nGovernment, ECPAT organized the first World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation last week in Stockholm in Sweden.\n\nStates participating in the Congress re-affirmed their commitment of battling the commercial sexual exploitation of children. But grass root organizations doubt that their governments have given any more than mere lip service.\n\n\"There is a big problem. (Only a few)  professional people (have) the proper skills. A lot of resources is also needed, yet virtually no support is coming from governments. The bulk of the responsibility lies on non-governmental organizations (NGOs), but there is also so much they can do, \" said Mr Abueva.\n\n\"A lot of things can be done without enormous resources,\" said Mr Ruby Noble, programme officer of the group Radda Bamen in Bangladesh.\n\n\"All we need is political commitment and will.\" Mr Gaurin Pradhan, executive director of The Child Workers' in Nepal Concerned Centre (CWIN), said the Nepalese government has shown little interest in ending the plight of Nepalese girls kidnapped and sold across the border into India.\n\nThe open borders between India and Nepal, said Mr Pradhan, and the involvement of policemen, has made the trafficking of Nepalese girls into India all that easier. \nWhat adds to the pain of NGOs is when Nepalese girls found to have gotten\nAIDS are simply deported by India.\n\n\"What, it is all right for the girls to be prostitutes if they are healthy and not if they already have Aids?\" said Mr Pradhan.\n\nGovernments do have the necessary political will, said Ms Prabha Basnet, Secretary of the Ministry for Women and Social Affairs of Nepal.\n\n\"We realise that children are the wealth of the nation. The Nepalese government is really working for the development and security of children. Not one, but five Ministries are involved in this effort. But the government has concentrated on the preventive measures, like advising and training parents. We want to stop child prostitution even before it begins,\" she added.\n\nTo the disappointment of South Asian NGOs, the Congress glossed over other problems related to sexual abuse of children, particularly that committed by males in the children's family and close relations.\n\nYet, researches have shown that a history of family sexual abuse influences the way children heal. \"There are so many factors in the recovery and healing of children victims,\" said Ms Edralin-Tiglao, executive director of the Women's Crisis Centre in the Philippines.\n\nWhether they heal or not, whether they fall back into prostitution depends on their history of abuse. Therapy gets a lot more complicated if they had been abused previously also by their fathers, stepfathers, uncles, brothers or men they used to trust.\"\n\nAccording to Ms Edralin- Tiglao, executive director of the Women's Crisis Centre in the Philippines part of the difficulty in making children heal can be traced to inappropriate handling. \"Many professionals look at child prostitutes as delinquents who must be rehabilitated. Yet, in reality, the ones who must be rehabilitated are the abusers. They are not like drug addicts, as though they addicted to sex.\"\n\nThe effects of sexual exploitation on children are profound, sometimes permanent, said Unicef executive director Carol Bellamy. Normal sexual, physical and emotional development is compromised. Self-esteem and confidence are undermined.\nWith the risk of contracting the HIV virus or Aids, sexual abuse threatens the children's health and even their lives. More often than not, they are also ostracized by their families and communities.\n\nSupport from the children's family or incidence of addiction to drugs also affects the way the children bounce back. It also depends on the environment. \"Even if she successfully recovers, but if poverty and violence continue to surround her, she will continue to be under pressure and stress,\" said Edralin- Tiglao.\n\nIn their study, \"A Right to Happiness: Approaches to the Prevention and Psycho-Social Recovery of Child Victims of Commercial Sexual Exploitation\", Jane Warburton and Teresa de la Cruz identified several strategies used by NGOs, including counseling. The use of art, theatre and music play therapy and journal writing and skills development .But they concluded that many therapy projects are fairly new, and thus have only relatively recent experiences against which to measure and determine outcomes and impact. Although addressing the psycho-social needs of abused children takes time and resources, the authors' stressed that children have the right to expect services to reduce the consequences of the abuses gone through.
