{"text": "How the Aids scourge makes rural areas poorer\nAids impoverishes families leaving them with few\nchoices. This exposes them to HIV/Aids through\nrisky behaviour. MARY MAKOKHA says that unless efforts are made to target Aids orphans in particular, they may become trapped in a cycle in\nwhich Aids controls their fate.\n\nThere is yet another funeral in Mzee Daudi's home.\nThe 76-year-old man has lost virtually everything\nhe had after HIV/Aids hit his family.\nToday the villagers have gathered to bury his\nfourth son. Mzee Daudi has no more cows left to\nslaughter for the demanding crowd of mourners.\nThe frustrated old man threatens to beat anyone\nwho disturbs him.\nIn four years, since 1994 Mzee Daudi has lost six\nsons, five daughters-in-law, a daughter, a son-in law\nand several grandchildren born within the period.\nHe has also slaughtered all his animals and sold\nhis land to get money to cleanse his family from the\nevil spell he believes has befallen them.\nOne major effect of HIV/Aids is the creation of\npoverty, especially in the rural areas.\nIgnorant of the fact that Aids is incurable, families\nhave exhausted their resources and sold land in\nthe search for treatment for sick relatives. It is even\nworse for those who never accept that they have\nAids.\nAfter testing HIV positive and watching his wife\nand baby die, a man from Buhuyi Village in Busia\ndistrict still went ahead to sell his livestock to pay\nfor the services of a witchdoctor and herbalist.\nBoth diagnosed his problem as lshira; a curse\nthat he had brought on himself by having an affair\nwith his brother's wife while his brother was still\nalive.\nMost families in the area seek healing from\nwitchdoctors, herbalists or spiritual healers on discovering that they are HIV-positive.\nEvelyn is the 38-year-old widow of a man who\nsuccumbed Aids last year. Hoping to cure his disease, her husband sold all their family land to buy drugs. When these failed, he invited Abasai \u2013 miracle healers to their home.\n\"Those men Iived,here until all the money we had was finished.\" Evelyn laments bitterly. Evelyn who is also HIV positive knows that she won't be here much longer and ponders as to what lies ahead for her children now that she has nothing to leave them.\n\"Why can't people listen when they are told that this disease has no cure,\" she asks\nAt Isongo Village, another woman has had to lease her 18-acre sugarcane plantation in order to raise Sb2oo,000 to transport her husband\u2019s body from Mombasa, where he died after contracting Aids. She later had to sell all her livestock to meet other funeral expenses. \nOrphans resort to roaming the streets of Busia\ntown where they are likely to get menial jobs as\nlabourers. Many engage petty crime to survive.\nThirteen-year-old Chris and his two sisters were\nleft in the custody of their uncle.\n\"My uncle used to hire us out to work for people\nbut he pocketed all the money. We even had to drop\nout of school because we could not keep up with all\nthe payments required at school,\" he says.\n. The children have since left their uncle's home.\nChris now roams the streets and his sisters work as\nhouse girls in Busia town.\n\"Our father's brothers have taken everything we\nEver owned, including our beds and chairs,\" he\nsays.\nEighteen-year-old Otieno claims his uncle went to Mumias Sugar Company with his late father's identity card and claimed ownership of the estate. Since he took over the deceased's sugarcane plantation, Otieno and his siblings have been left without anything.\nMany young girl orphans become commercial\nsex workers so as to feed their siblings and in doing\nso expose themselves to HIV.\nTwenty-year-old Joyce who is the first born in a\nfamily of seven found herself heading the family after her parents died. \"\nJoyce dropped out of school when her father's health deteriorated, and took a job as a house-girl at\nBumala town. She fed her siblings from her meagre\npay of Sh400.\nDesperate for more money to meet her family's\nneeds Joyce turned to prostitution. \"I always carried\na condom,\" she says.\nJoyce never believed that anyone would spread\nAids deliberately until last December when she met a smartly dressed stranger from Busia border.\nThe man was willing to pay Joyce Sh10,000 for a\nnight at a Bumala lodging. \nJoyce became suspicious when the man refused\nto use the condom she offered.\nHe was also not willing to undress with the lights on. All the same, she noticed that he was thin and\nhis body covered with wounds and decided to leave.\nLater she was to find out that he was suspected to be HIV positive and may have intentionally wanted\nto infect Joyce.\nA lot of emphasis has been put on the need for a\nchange in sexual behaviour. However this is not all\nthat needs to be done. Exploitative cultures like\nfeasting in funerals at the expense of the bereaved\nshould also be done away with and so too should\ntraditions that require individuals to be buried in\ntheir ancestral homes.\nBut a priority must be ensuring that Aids orphans\ndo not become trapped in a cycle in which they are\nfirst orphaned by Aids and then forced into poverty,\nwhich leaves them no choice, but to expose themselves to HIV. (AWC Features)\n\nTraditions and immorality have been blamed for the increased spread of Aids. The scourge has left many\npeople poor."}
