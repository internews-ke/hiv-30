{"text": "HIV: Breast\nmilk a danger\nBy MIKE MWANIKI\nBabies born to HIV -positive\nmothers risk acquiring the virus\nthrough breastfeeding, a UN report\nsays.\nThe recently launched Unicef\nProgress of Nations 1999 Report\nsays about 500 to 700 infants are\ninfected this way every day, but\nadds that the exact mechanism of\ntransmission is still not fully understood.\n\"Before the terrible spectre of\nHIV/Aids emerged, breastfeeding\nwas recognised as the best\nway to. feed infants in virtually\nall circumstances.\n\"Now, given the possibility of\ntransmitting HIV through breastfeeding,\njoint WHO/Unicef/UNAids\nguidelines on infant feeding\nhave been issued to assist policy\nmakers and health workers in addressing\nthat risk and helping to\nsafeguard the rights of mothers\nand their children,\" it says.\nCentral to these guidelines,\nthe report notes, is the right of\nmothers to make decisions, on the basis of full and clear information,\non what is best for them\nand their infants and to be supported in carrying out those decisions.\n\"The guidelines warn of the .\npotential harm in mixing breastfeeding\nand artificial feeding. Indeed,\nrecent findings suggest\nthat this combination may be\nparticularly dangerous to\ninfants. \"\nAccording to the report, a new\nstudy of babies up to three\nmonths of age born to infected\nmothers suggests that those who\nare exclusively breastfed may\nface a significantly lower risk\nthan was previously thought.\n\"The study posits that feeding\nother solids or fluids in addition\nto mother's milk in the first\nmonths of life may be what injures\nthe baby's gut (intestine)\nand allows the killer virus to enter\nbody tissues. Additional research\nis urgently needed to pursue\nthese important early\nfindings. ' In the meantime, the report\nnotes, it remains critical to prevent\n\"spill-over\" of artificial\nfeeding to women who can safely\nbreastfeed.\n\"This is best done through\ncontinued efforts by governments\nto implement the International\nCode of Marketing of\nBreastmilk Substitutes.\"\nThe guidelines also call for access\nto voluntary and confidential\nHIV counselling and testing\nfor women and men.\n\"Women who are aware of\ntheir HIV status should be counselled\non the risk of HIV transmission\nto their babies and on the\nbenefits and risks of all the various\ninfant feeding options.\"\nWomen who are HIV negative,\nor who do not know their\nstatus, the report adds, should be\ninformed of the benefits of\nbreastfeeding and of the particular\nimportance of avoiding infection\nin the future."}
