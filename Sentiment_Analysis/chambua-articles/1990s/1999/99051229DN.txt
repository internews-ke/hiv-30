{"text": "May 12, 1999\n\nIt\u2019s time we got angry and acted on rapists\u2028\n\u2028\nCharlene\u2019s story. I told a colleague soon after reading it, affected me more than any other rape every  did.\u2028\nHer searing account captures\u2028\nthe fear the violation at her\nbody which we don\u2019t get in rape\u2028\ncases reported in newspapers. The\nreason is simple the newspaper\u2028\naccounts are 50 sanitized that they\u2028\nare reduced to just another tragic\u2028\nstory with a victim no different\u2028\nfrom others.\u2028\nBut Charlene highlights the\u2028\nrape phenomenon in a way that\u2028\nstatistics can never do.\u2028\nHer story is a sharp reminder of\u2028\nhow vulnerable women are to this\u2028\nfrightening, dehumanizing and\u2028\nlife-shattering experience.\u2028\nIn Charlene own words, her\u2028\nrape is not hers alone. It represents\u2028\nthousands of women and children\u2028\nraped in her own country and every where around the world.\u2028\nIn our society, many rape victims \u2028\n are too ashamed to report to\u2028\nhe police because of die ridicule\u2028\nthey are subjected to be insensitive\u2028\npolice officers, having so narrate the ordeal in open court after\u2028\nwhich culprits  get away with light\u2028\nsentences, among other fears.\u2028\nSome don\u2019t even go to hospital.\u2028\nAs a result we have many women\u2028\nsuffering quietly They live in a\u2028\ndark world and never want to open\u2028\nthe curtains. But who cares?\u2028\nWitness this: Mary, was going\u2028\nhome at about 8 pm. She realised\u2028\nshe shouldn\u2019t have taken the dark\u2028\nalley to the bus stop when it was\u2028\ntoo late She met a gang of street\u2028\nboys who raped her. She was rescued by good Samaritans but was\u2028\ntoo ashamed to go to the police\u2028\nstation. She felt so dirty and\u2028\nashamed When she couldn\u2019t take\u2028\nit any more she committed suicide. It\u2019s only when the family\u2028\nread the suicide note that they\u2028\nknew about her ordeal. How many\u2028\nmore Marys do we have? But,\u2028\nthen, who cares?\u2028\u2028\n\nFourteen-year-old Stella Wanjiru\nis a  mother of a one-year-old\nchild of a rapist, a former Kenya\nNavy officer husband of her class\nteacher. The mother reported the\ncrime locally but nothing was\ndone.. Despite the Federation of\nWomen Lawyers (Fida) writing to\nthe Police Commissioner inquiring\nwhy the man has not been\narrested, the commissioner has\nnot responded.\nThe question that springs to\nmind is: Why should the person\nresponsible for condemning such\na girl to an early, stigmatised\nmotherhood and a life of hopelessness\nbe allowed to get away\nwith it?\nEveryday a woman or child is\nraped. One in two Kenyan women\nwill be raped in their lifetime usually\nby somebody they know and,\nmore often than not, in their own\nhomes. This minute, more than\none woman is being raped\nsomewhere.\nBut that's all. No fear. No horror\n\nNo loathing from a public that\nhas come to accept rape as normal.\nBut it is not.\nWitness this: a 10 year-old\ngirl is allegedly raped and injured\nby two Port police officers for two\ndays. She identifies them in a parade.\nBut the men cannot be arrested\nuntil the Attorney-General\ntakes action. How long will the\nAG take before acting on the file?\nNo one knows. This is justice for\nyou. So. why should anyone bother\nreporting rape cases to the\npolice?\nImagine a 10-year-old girl being\nsexually abused by two grown\nup men? Needless to say, the\nchild sustained body injuries.\nThen imagine the fear of the child\nas she faced a queue of men - police\nofficers at that - as she identified\nher alleged molesters. And\neven after doing that, the police\ntry to use her background to discredit\nher story.\nBut is anybody angry enough or\nmust their daughters and sisters be\n\nraped for 'hem to seek a solution?\nPeople are still not angry\nenough about what is happening\nto women.\nWhy are husband's, fathers\nsons  and brothers still running\nagainst their daughters, sisters,\nwives and mothers?\nRape today is not only an emotional \ndeath penalty. With Aids\nit's now a physical death penalty.\nBut how many of us are aware\nof what to do if raped? Fourteen year old Stella shouldn't be carrying\na rapist's child if the family\nwas aware of rape consequences.\nHow many of us are aware, like\nCharlene, about antiretroviral\ndrugs such as AZT which help\nlessen the potential of getting\nAids? Are our clinics and hospitals\nequipped to treat rape victims\nwith anti-Aids drugs?\nThe ignorance, dismissal and\nlack of public and political will to\ndeal with rape as a societal evil\ngoes to show we don't take rape\nseriously.\n\nSo far only a few organizations\nare trying to deal with it. But over all \nno solid effort by the public \n\norganizations dealing with violence\nagainst women should raise\nmore awareness on the part of \nrape cases, There should be social\nwelfare officers and family educators\nto whom rape cases can be reported and who can then help the\nvictims report the cases to the police\n\nGovernment intervention is a\nmust. Justice has been fragile. We\nneed more visible policing, sensitive\nmagistrates and better treatment\nof survivors \nWe also need education in the\nhome and school to teach young\nboys that rape is wrong.\nIt is a scourge that needs to be\ndealt with by everyone."}
