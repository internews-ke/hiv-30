{"text": "Emergency appeal on\nworldwide Aids spread\nCommonwealth leaders meeting\nin South Africa this week should\ndeclare a global state of emergency\non AIDS and lead efforts\nto stem the pandemic, Commonwealth\nmedical associations said\ntoday\nThe Commonwealth Medical\nAssociation (CMA) Trust said it\nwould lobby leaders of Britain\nand its former colonies to give\ngreater priority to research on\ndeveloping a vaccine that would\nbe affordable and suitable for\ndeveloping countries.\nThe Trust, which represents\nmedical associations from the\nCommonwealth, is holding a one day\nmeeting tomorrow to discuss\npriorities and action on AIDS, ahead of the leaders' meeting\nstarting on Friday.\n\"The idea behind it is we\nencourage the heads of government\nin their communique to\npoint out that HIV/AIDS is a\nstate of emergency,\" CMA director\nMarianne Haslegrave told\nReuters.\nIf we're going to be able to do\nanything, the heads of government\nhave to acknowledge the\nreality of the situation and to\nbegin the debate that needs to be\ntaking place and to be in the forefront\nof speaking out against the\nspread of HIV/AIDS.\" \u2022\nAIDS experts and activists\nrecently criticised African leaders\nin particular for staying aloof from efforts to stem the spread of HIV, which has hit the world's\npoorest continent the hardest.\nThere are 16,000 new infections\naround the world daily, the\nmajority of these in sub-Saharan\nAfrica, and last year 2.5 million\npeople died from AIDS-related\nillnesses.\nAccording to the U.S. Census\nBureau's 1998 World Population\nProfile, AIDS has cut life expectancy\nto less than 40 from 65 years\nin several Commonwealth countries\nin southern Africa, including\nBotswana, Zambia and\nZimbabwe. '\nParticipants at an international\nAIDS conference in Zambia in September said that despite these grim statistics and the burden the\npandemic had imposed on African\neconomies, the continent's\nleaders seemed to have no time to\nlead efforts to staunch it.\nMr Haslegrave said the CMA\nhoped the fact that Commonwealth\nleaders were meeting in\nthe worst AIDS-hit area would\nhighlight the importance of making\na commitment to the global\nanti-AIDS fight.(Reuters)\n\"In previous communiques,\nheads of government have not\nnecessarily pointed out that\nthings are reaching the terrible\nstate they are now in, a crisis\nstate as far as Aids is concerned,\"\nMr Haslegrave said."}
