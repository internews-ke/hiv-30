{"text": "Aids: Why school children are dying\nStatistics about Aids can never tell the whole story for the\nsimple reason that after the initial consternation, people prefer\nto go on with their lives as though they heard nothing. But\nthey do not have to listen to statistics which have a habit of\nnumbing the mind anyway. They see the effects of this epidemic\nalmost every day when they lose their relatives, friends\nand acquaintances. This is probably the only time they realise\nthat they too are as just as vulnerable unless they do something\nabout their sexual proclivities, partners and themselves.\nBut the saddest thing about Aids is not that a huge number of\nKenyans are ignorant about what it is that they should fear, By\nnow, they know a lot more than they did when Aids first struck\nin Kenya back in 1984. Yet more than 700,000 have died of\nAids in the last IS years while 1.9 million others are HIV\npositive, meaning that they will all be dead by the next five\nyears.\nThere is more to Aids than the grim statistics. And we are not\ntalking necessarily of those who succumb to the opportunistic\nailments that define Aids, It is those left behind who bear the\nbrunt of the devastation.\nNow it is emerging that there is more to it than this. A report\ncarried in yesterday's edition of this newspaper says children,\nespecially secondary school students, are dropping out at an\nalarming rate because of Aids. In some cases it is because they\nhave lost both their parents who succumbed to Aids, or because\nthey themselves fall victim.\nThere is a good reason why this last happens. Students\nbetween the ages of 15 and 19 are the ones who are getting\ninfected fastest because this is the age in which they experiment\nwith sex most. According to a seminar held last week in\nNairobi, at least 11.4 per cent of all girls enrolled in school drop\nout for either one of the two reasons. It is said that at least 20\nper cent of all students - in secondary school and colleges \nare HIV positive, which in real terms ,means that one every 15 school child is infected. Educationists believe the introduction\nof sex education is the best answer. But the Church is\nvehemently opposed to the suggestion that sex education should\nbe offered in schools, with the spuious argument that this will\nspread immorality amongst youth- as if teenagers need to be\ntaught how to engage in sex. The Church has never come up\nwith anything to help youth protect themselves from\nAids. Telling them to abstain is not the answer."}
