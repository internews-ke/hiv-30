{"text": "Aids: Abstinence the sole cure\n\nIt was disappointing to read in the Daily\nNation, October 6, comments by Mr Crispin\nWilson, the head of Unicef Kenya, against the\nChurch's stand on the use of the condom as a\nprophylactic against Aids.\nFrom what he said, the Church \"sits back\nyet the epidemic is claiming people in large\nnumbers ...\" it is clear Mr Wilson is not familiar\nwith the Church's aggressive campaign to\neducate people on the only safe way of avoiding Aids abstinence.\nMr Wilson should recognise that even the\ngreatest scientists say abstinence is the only\ncertain way of avoiding Aids. Unfortunately,\nmost scientists conveniently refuse to recognise\nthe great will-power humanity possesses.\nThe Church puts humanity at its proper\nlevel and has confidence that people, unlike\nanimals, are able to control their sexual drive.\nScientists, because of lack of understanding,\ncreate the unsupported belief that people cannot\ncontrol themselves. Therefore, they prefer\nto provide solutions (such as the condom) that\ndo not work but only change the problem.\nThe greatest irony about using the condom\nis that the device that is supposed to protect\none from contracting disease is the same\ndevice that encourages one to have sex, yet\nthe flow-chart is simple: If you have sex, you put yourself at risk, even while using\ncondoms.\nIf, on the other hand, you understand the\npurpose of sex and are able to control your\nsexual drive, then you do not put yourself at\nrisk at all.\nLet Mr Wilson alert people that the condom\nhas its failures. In the book, Contraceptive\nTechnology published in New York, there is a\nlist of failure rates of different contraceptive\nmethods, both theoretically and practically.\nThe condom failure rates at 2 per cent theoretically\nand 10 per cent practically. But these\nare New York statistics. What are the practical\nfailure rates of the condom in Kenya'?\nIt does not matter to the person for whom\nthe condom fails what statistics show, for once\none is infected because the \"mighty protector\"\nfailed, the whole thing stops being a matter of\nstatistics and becomes one of Aids and death.\nMr Wilson, who is professionally keen on\neducating the people on safety, should also\nknow that people do not know all they should\nabout how to use the condom. For instance\nhow many people know that the condom\nshould not be used with oil-based lubricants\n(such a vaseline) because it tears easily'? Does\nthe common mwananchi know that the condom\nhas an expiry date'? Moreover, the quality of condoms affordable\nby the common mwananchi is questionable.\nWhich Kenyan body ascertains that condoms\nin the Kenya market are up to standard'?\nThere are many Church groups already\ndoing a brilliant job on educating 'young people\n- who are the greatest targets of condom\nmanufacturers-on the values of abstinence.\nGroups like True Love Waits, do not just\npreach the don'ts of sex; they explain to young\npeople the beauty of not being promiscuous.\nThey tackle the issue of Aids in a positive\nmanner, which young people understand better,\nby encouraging them to live a chaste life.\nNow that Mr Wilson knows even scientists\nrecommend abstinence as, the surest way to\navoid Aids, he should admire the Church for\nadvocating that people try that method. He\nshould go further and donate to the church just\none-tenth of the money used to buy and distribute\ncondoms, and follow up on how much\nthe Church would have achieved by a certain\nperiod of time. He will be amazed.\nLet Mr Wilson not forget that the Church is\nthe people and not the bishops, priests or pastors.\nAnd if the people say they do not want to\nbe encouraged to promiscuous habits, then\nthe desire of the people must be respected!\nSharon Makoriwa.\nNairobi.\n\nFord-K has failed voters\nThe party preferred by voters in\ntwo districts, Bungoma and Trans\nNzoia, in the last two General\nElections was Ford Kenya. The\nparty has a been led by Mr Michael\nWamalwa since the demise of Jaramogi\nOginga Odinga in January\n1994. It is now time to take stock.\nThe vision, mission, goals and\nobjectives of Ford-Kenya as enunciated\nin its manifesto inspired the\n-, people of the two districts to rally\n\" behind the party. It represented a\ncredible alternative to the status\nquo.\nBut we are dismayed that\ndespite the people's goodwill to\nthe party, its top leadership has\nfailed to establish, sustain or build\non the mission of the party. It is\napparent that the party is now in a\ncrisis for the following reasons:\n0. The party infrastructure, operations\nand office network have\nground to a halt.\n0. The party's national image is\nseverely dented.\n0. The party is torn apart by'\nunnecessary incessant leadership\nsquabbles and the centre can no\nlonger hold.\nIn Bungoma and Trans Nzoia,\nthe national party .chairman has\nsince the last General Election\nopenly engaged in persistent divisive\nand antagonistic\n\n\nintrigues against elected MPs instead of consolidating the party whose strength lies in the unity and unwavering support' of elected MPs, councillors, party officials and the general grassroots members. \nHe has also failed to assist the victims\nof cattle rustling and ethnic cleansing. It is apparent the Ford-Kenya chairman and some of his sycophants have taken upon themselves, at the behest of forces, to divide, fragment, disorient and paralyse the party. The ongoing illusory \"dialogue\" of the Ford-Kenya chairman and a few of his sycophants with Kanu cannot and Will .not benefit the residents of Bungoma Trans Nzoia. It is a total betrayal of the mission of the party. The opportunity costs are terribly high. \nThe area is beset by abject poverty,\ndilapidated or non-existent health facilities and lack of a coordinated effort to arrest the HIV crisis. Its educational facilities have also collapsed. \nM. Barasa. \nBungoma."}
