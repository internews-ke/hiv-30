{"text": "Uganda's lesson with Aids\nBy NATION Correspondent\nThe Uganda AIDS Commission-\n(UAC) is not telling a rosy story\nall the way but there is cause to\ncelebrate the drop infection by the\nHIV/Aids virus in Uganda.\nThat this infection has fallen by\n50 per cent is very encouraging to\nthe developing world where the\nhold of Aids is stronger on an already\nvulnerable population.\nAccording to the acting director general of Uganda UAC, Dr\nJohn Rwomushana, political commitment\nhas been played a main\nrole in the story of victory against\nHIV/Aids. Dr Rwomushana says: \"Such\ncommitment becomes significant\nbecause it ensures appropriate\npolicy, enables laws, budgetary\nprovision and other structures\nwhich make action against the\nspread of the virus effective.\"\nThe famous principle of openness\nabout Aids has characterised\nUganda's strategy.\nUgandans say there has been a\ndemocratic flexibility, with different\nactors being allowed to contribute\nin whatever style they\nwished.\nPresident Museveni involved\nall in the Uganda AIDS Commission,\nappointing a bishop as one of\nits leaders. The Ugandan media\nhave played a crucial role too.\nThe good news about Aids in\nUganda is also that the battle for\nprevention is definitely winning\nbecause all blood for transfusion\nis 100 per cent guaranteed to be\nfree of the deadly virus.\nIt seems that there, everyone\npersonally got armed to crush the\nthreat to 21 million Ugandans\nwhose 1.4 million are living with\nAids and five million have died of\nit. They could not allow the catastrophic\nimpact on development\nto deteriorate further. The reasons for Uganda's success\nrevolve around the governments\ncommitment to protect its\nown. Ideas were swiftly translated\ninto action which included the setting\nup of 13 Aids control\nprogrammes.\nThe fact that small communities\nstarted to fight the scourge in\ntheir own way was no mean\nachievement to Uganda which has\na highly educated population.\nThe internationally renowned\nAnthem of Aids by Philly Lutaaya,\na singer who returned from\nSweden to die of the infection in\nUganda, helped establish this extrovert\nattitude towards Aids.\nTo have a religious figure, the\nbishop, in UAC helped make Aids\na matter of deep thought to\npreachers in Uganda.\nIn Kenya, Aids is not mentioned\nin funerals. Even preachers\nspeak euphemistically of the disease\nand continue to say that it is a\ncurse from God for the unfaithful.\nA multi-sectoral approach\nagainst Aids in Uganda has guaranteed\nthat districts are reached by\nnumerous NGOs and agencies.\nIn 1992, HIV sentinel testing\nposts showed a rate of infection at\n30 per cent which in 1997 had come down to 15 per cent. Energy\nis now going to maintaining the\ndownward trend.\nWhile the humorous Dr Rwomushana\nexplained how strategies\nto curb the spread of Aids have\nworked, he reminded a Pan-African\nMedia Seminar on Reproductive\nHealth last month that an island\nof success in Uganda will be\nmeaningless since the virus will\nultimately cross borders if it is not\nchecked diligently all over the\nworld.\nIt is an apt message indeed for\nneighbouring countries such as\nKenya."}
