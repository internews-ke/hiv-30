{"text": "Abstinence will keep Aids at bay\nHow safe is safe sex? Many of us\nremain trapped in the idea of condom\nuse as safe sex. Fine, but we\nseem to be singing the chorus of a\nsong which bears some truth\nblended with falsehood, ignorance\nand misconceptions. There\nis need to give equal or even more\nattention to abstinence.\nThe greatest challenge (and\nwhich many have failed) is exercising\nabstinence. It's the only\nsure protection against Aids.\nBesides abstinence and condom\nuse, doctors and other medical\nworkers recommend the following\nmeasures to keep Aids at\nbay: o Know your partner: Knowledge\nof one's sexual partner's behavioural\ntrend, health status and\ngeneral sexuality is vital. Some\ndoctors suggest an HIV/Aids test\nbefore involvement in an intimate\nrelationship.\no HIV mothers and baby: HIV\nmothers should use caesarean\nmeans of delivery in order to prevent\nmother-to-baby transmission\ncommonly found in the ordinary\nway of delivery. Also bottle feeding is advisable instead of\nbreast-feeding as it prevents infection\nafter birth.\nThe risk' of a baby's infection\nduring pregnancy can be reduced\nby use of AZT, an anti-Aids drug\ntaken by the mother. Though expensive,\nits trials have been found\nviable and useful, especially in the\nWest, including the United States. o Faithful monogamous relationships:\nIn most cases, HIV/Aids spread is usually aggravated\nby multiple sexual affairs as in\nprostitution, polygamy or infidelity.\nWhen attending to an HIV/Aids\npatient at home or in hospital,\nwear surgical gloves, especially\nwhen dealing with open wounds,\nvomit and general sanitation.\no Avoid sharing unsterilised\ntatooing and ear-piercing devices,\ncitcumcision knives and injections\no Proper screening of donated\nblood.\nSince there is no cure for Aids,\nprevention is the best way out.\nEsmond Shahonya,\nMombasa "}
