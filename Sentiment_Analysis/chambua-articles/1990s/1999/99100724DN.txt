{"text": "City in the grip of TB epidemic\u2028\nBy JOSEPH GICHURU\u2028\nTuberculosis (TB) has become a major hospitalisation disease in\u2028Nairobi mainly because of Aids related complications, treatment\u2028failures, poor nutrition coupled with\u2028overcrowding and poor living conditions.\u2028\nThe rising cases in the City has worried medical experts in the last several years, According to Dr Ndambuki Mboloi, the head of the respiratory and infectious diseases department at\u2028the Kenyatta National Hospital(KNH), it is feared that new TB\u2028cases registered at the hospital could exceed 2000 this year alone,\u2028\n \u2018\u2018By the end of last year, the country registered over 40,000 TB\u2028cases, with at least 10,000 cases being registered at Nairobi alone,\u201d\u2028the chest physician says, attributing the increase partly to TB awareness and the disease association with\u2028HIV/Aids.\u2028\n \u201cOf all the TB cases requiring admission to the TB ward at\u2028\n Mbagathi District Hospital (formerly Infectious Diseases Hospital),\u2028\n 70-00 per cent are H1V-postive.\u2028\n HIV infection increases one\u2019s\u2028\n TB vulnerability, with eight per cent of those who are infected with\u2028\n HIV developing active TB within a year, as compared to five percent\u2028\n life-time risk for those who are HIV-negative,\u201d observes Dr\u2028\n Mboloi.\u2028\n At KNH, where a separate register for TB cases was opened three\u2028years ago at the hospital\u2019s chest clinic, 1,900 cases were reported in the first 10 months. Between January and June 1990 alone 900 cases\u2028were diagnosed.\u2028\nThe upsurge of TB cases is attributable to a number of factors\u2028but the main one is the weakening of immune system in some persons\u2028especially those infected with HIV.\u2028The chances of healthy people developing active TB are increased by the multiplicity of and intermingling with TB- infected HIV positive people. \n Dr Mboloi, a lung specialist, says TB of the lungs can be spread when an infected person sneezes or coughs and the bacterium are inhaled by another person. The bacterium remains infectious long after\nSputum has dried he says, making living in crowded habitations easy prey or the disease.\nIt multiplies in the lungs, but in healthy person, the immune system halts the spread, making the disease to lie dormant only to be reactivated many years later when progressive lung damage occurs. TB can spread to affect any organ or tissue, for example, the brain, the kidneys and the bone, says Dr Mboloi.\u2028\n \nIn 1993, World Health Organisation (WHO) sound a TB alarm, declaring it a \u201cglobal emergency.\u201d By 1995, WHO estimated that 22 million people were suffering from the disease. By the close of the century of the century, the disease is expected to kill 30 million people besides infecting 90 million others.\nThe upsurge of TB eases started in the mid-1990s, says the UN agency. A phenomenon that has confounded health professionals since escalation of TB cases occurred when medical research attention had shifted to other areas of medical science.\n \n "}
