{"text": "Sex worker helped\n'to develop vaccine'\nBy MIKE MWANIKI\nSixty commercial sex workers in Nairobi have helped in the development of the Sh300 million HIV/Aids trial vaccine.\nDr Ephantus Njagi, a researcher based at the Majengo clinic, Nairobi, said yesterday the slum based prostitutes have repeatedly been exposed to the virus that causes Aids but have failed to contract it since 1985.\nOn Monday, the leader of the HIV trials - to be known as the Oxford-Nairobi International Aids Vaccine Initiative (INVI) project - Prof Andrew McMichael of Oxford, said volunteers for the trials will be injected with a new genetic vaccine developed from the DNA of the Aids virus.\nYesterday, Dr Njagi, who presented a paper on the \"HIV related mortality among female sex workers in Majengo\" said the cumulative study showed that the probability of long-term survival for those who had the virus was about 25 per cent.\nThe University of Nairobi researcher was speaking at an ongoing workshop on \"HIV Vaccine Trials in Kenya\" at Nairobi's Mayfair Court Hotel.\nHe said his team was encouraging the prostitutes to use interventions such as condoms during sexual liaisons while his group closely monitored them for other infections and gave them appropriate treatment.\n\"We also counsel those who are infected on proper dietary habits and nutrition,\" he said.\nOther participants at the workshop accused the donor community of neglecting the funding of Aids orphans programmes. The researchers, who are drawn from internationally recognized institutions in the area of sexually transmitted infections and HIV/Aids, said a country like Kenya which currently has about 600,000 Aids orphans \u2013 needs \"adequate response and interventions\" geared at urgently addressing the problem.\nA local researcher, Dr Michael Meegan, told the workshop that a study he undertook from June to\nOctober last year in Busia, Migori, Siaya and Kericho involving 1,239 Aids orphans, 56 and 47 per cent of girls and boys respectively dropped out of school.\n\"Girls were almost twice as likely to be seriously sick as boys, and of the seven reported deaths, five were girls,\" he said.\nHe said that a \"big surprise\" awaited the nation if the \"issue of Aids orphans\" continued to be ignored.\nReporting on a study carried out at the Coast General Hospital, Dr Fabian Mwanyumba said the majority of women attending ante-natal clinic who had HIV had chosen not to inform their husbands about their status due to fear of their rejection.\n\"However, the majority of the husbands who had been informed of their wives' sero-positive status were understanding and supportive\" he added. \nThe doctor said most HIV positive women found it \"useful\" to know their sero-status as it enabled them to \"be more careful in their sexual affairs\".\nAnother report presented said HIV positive mothers at Pumwani Maternity Hospital infected their\noffspring during breastfeeding."}
