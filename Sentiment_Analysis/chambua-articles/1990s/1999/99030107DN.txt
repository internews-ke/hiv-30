{"text": "Aids origin theory is racist\nA recent claim by scientists at the\nUniversity of Alabama in the\nUnited States that Aids originated\nfrom africa through chimpanzees\nis nothing but an indication of racial\nprejudice.\nAccording to Dr Beatrice Hahn,\na chimpanzee named Marilyn has\nhelped confirm that the Aids virus\nwas passed on to people by\nchimps.\nSince the Aids epidemic began,\nabout 100 chimps have been intentionally\ngiven the Aids virus in\nan effort to learn more about the\ndisease.\nBut while these animals get infected,\nnone until now, had actually\ndeveloped Aids. This has made\nmany scientists doubt whether the\ndisease was even possible in a\nchimp.\nAccording to an Associated\nPress report of January 30, 1996\none of the things that has made\nAids so difficult to control has\nbeen the lack of a so-called animal\nmodel - a lab animal used for\nstudies instead of humans.\nWhile monkeys get sick with a\nversion of HIV, researchers fear\nthat insights from studying these\nanimals may not apply to people,\nyet the Alabama University scientists\nare still convinced that their\nfinding is authentic.\nIn 1981. shortly after the recognition of Aids in the US, cases of\nthe disease were alleged to have\nbeen identified among Africans\nliving in Europe, the intention being\nto show that anything dirty or\nundesirable must come from\nAfrica. This is why these scientists\nare still insisting that Aids\noriginated from chimpanzees.\nIn 1983. scientists from Europe\nand the US carried out investigations\nand alleged that Aids first\noriginated from Africa. In 1976. a\nDanish surgeon who had visited\nZaire also alleged the same.\nIt is because of this prejudice\nthat efforts by traditional and professional\ndoctors to come up with\ncombination drugs for Aids therapy\nto help minimise the spread of\nthe virus just like in Europe and\nthe US have never been acknowledged\nby the World Health Organisation.\nAfrica is only seen as the palace\nwhere their drugs can be tested on\nhuman beings, yet in the developed\ncountries, animals are\nused.\nI do agree with the many Africans\nopposed to this kind of action\nbecause the general attitude of\nsome white people towards Africans\nis that nothing in Africa really\ndeserves the tag. \"human.\"\nFr Joachim Omolo Ouko,\nBrooklyn, New York."}
