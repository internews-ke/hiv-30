{"text": "Legalise abortion to save lives\nIn the recent past, there has been\na heated debate on the issues of\nabortion, homosexuality and prostitution.\nI am one of those people\nwho have been keenly following\nthe exchange of words among different\ninterest groups including\nFIDA, Maendeleo ya Wanawake,\nchurches and politicians. There are\nreasons why I feel abortion\nshould be legalised.\nResearch tells us that nearly 20\nper cent of schoolgirls between\nthe ages of 14 and 21 drop out of\nschool every year because of\nunwanted pregnancies and about\n80 per cent of them never return\nto school.\nSome of these unwanted pregnancies\nare the result of forced\nsex. What is a girl who conceives\nduring a rape ordeal supposed to\ndo with the baby?\nSecondly, we are living in the\nera of Aids. It has been proved\nthat nearly 90 per cent, if not all,\nof the babies born by HIV infected\nmothers are infected as\nwell.\nNormally, these children do not\nlive beyond five years. One wonders\nwhy they should be allowed\nto face such a painful death when\nit could have been prevented\nthrough abortion once the mother tested HIV positive.\nIn. some cases, girls, or even\nmothers become pregnant when\nthey are not ready for babies. A\nyoung girl of 14 years who falls\nin love with a boy' of 16 may be\ntempted to make love. A mother\nwho does not want more children\nmay accidentally become pregnant.\nIn both cases, the would-be\nmothers would have had a choice\nwere abortion legalised.\nLastly, it is a fact that abortion\nis illegally done in this country\nand both qualified and unqualified\ndoctors benefit financially\nfrom people who are desperate.\nWhat makes the matter worse\nis that some of these unqualified\ndoctors perform risky operations\nwhich lead to death or infertility\namong women and young girls.\nThese deaths are never\nreported to police and the offenders\nalways go unpunished. If\nabortion was legalised, these\natrocities would cease.\nIt is for the above reasons that I\nurge Kenyans to weigh the benefits\nand disadvantages of abortion,\nand realise that legalisation\nis the only way forward.\nDavid R.
