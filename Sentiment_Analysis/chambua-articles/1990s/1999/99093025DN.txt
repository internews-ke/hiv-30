{"text": "THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 30, 1999\n\nAids menace looms larger than life\n\nBy MIKE MWANIKI\u2028\n More than 200,000 Kenyans will\u2028\n die from Ads before the end of\u2028\n this year, an official of the Kenya\u2028\n National Aids and Sexually\u2028\n Transmitted Infections Control\u2028\n Programme says.\u2028\n Dr Tom Mboya Okeyo, the\u2028\n STI\u2019s project coordinator said the latest statistics showed that 13 to 14 per cent of all adult Kenyans were infected with HIV.\u2028\n Addressing a one-day seminar which assembled senior Kenya\u2028\n Revenue Authority staffers recently al the Kenya School of\u2028\n Monetary Studies, Dr Okeyo said\u2028\n \u201cThis means that about 1.9 million people ate infected,\u2028 including 700,000 children under the age of five.\u2028\n \u2018Infection levels extend 20 percent of all adults in Busia,\u2028\n Kisumu, Meru, Nakuru and\u2028\n Thika. In Nairobi and Mombasa, about I5 per cent of adults are\u2028\n HIV positive,\u201d\u2028\n At the same time, Dr Mboya noted, about 700,000 people have already died of Aids while an estimated 300,000 others will become infected with HIV this year.\u2028\n Research studies, the STI boss said, showed that most of the new infections were occurring among the youth, particularly among young women aged l5to l9.\u2028\n Dr Okeyo called for the establishment of programmes designed to protect young people, particularly women, before they become sexually active.\u2028\n In his opening remarks, KRA Commissioner-General John Msafari disclosed that Aids killed 40 out of the 53 KRA employees who died last year.\u2028\n He said this meant HIV/Aids infection was responsible for 8O per cent of the deaths occurring in the 4,000 strong workforce.\u2028\n \u201cThe loss of these people to what is euphemistically described an \u2018a long illness\u2019 has net only devastated their families but also had an overwhelming impact on the operations and resources of the authority.\u201d\u2028\n A University of Nairobi senior lecturer, Dr Ruth Nduati says an increasingly high number of pregnant women attending clinics\nin various  health institutions in the count in the country had the killer HIV virus.\nAccording to estimates by UNAids, Dr Nduati said, in\nKenya, the median HIV infection rates among pregnant women attending antenatal clinics range from a median of 139 per thousand in rural areas to 159 per, thousand in urban areas and an overall 780,000 HIV infected women.\nThe peak of infection in women,\nDr Nduati, who was presenting a paper on \"Vulnerability of\nWomen and HIV\" during an integrated training for community-based health care workers seminar, is 15to 35 years.\nThe Seminar was held at the\nKenya College of\nCommunication Technology,\nMbagathi, Nairobi.\nMeanwhile, the Permanent Secretary for Health, Prof Julius\nMeme, describes the HlV/Aids pandemic as \"an incredible\" burden in the health- care services sector.\nIn parts of Nyanza Province, for example, more than 50 per cent of medical wards are occupied by Aids victims.\n\"The patients who are ravaged by HlV-related infections such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, boils and other infections, would in\nNormal circumstances do not require\nhospitalisation .\n\"Due to their weak immune systems, they end up staying longer in hospital and using more expensive drugs in treating their recurrent infections,\u201d\nDr Okeyo concurs with Prof\nMeme's sentiments adding that at the Kenyatta National Hospital, between 50 to 70 per cent of beds are occupied by Aids patients.\n\"Apart from expensive drugs, there is a high rate of usage of medical supplies such as gauze due to the opportunistic infections affecting the victims,\u201d\nAdds Dr Okeyo: \"Kenyans should not expect better health services as long as HIV cases continue rising in the country while the health sector budget is not increased.\n\"It is sad that our people have failed to internalise the magnitude of this pandemic by engaging in safe sex\u201d\nThe impact of the pandemic in household where a husband/father has Aids includes:\n*The entire family savings is used\nin taking care of the victim's\nsickness;\n*Children leave school.\nThe way forward in addressing the pandemic, Dr Okeyo suggests\u2028include\u2028\n \u00b0Parents holding open discussions with their children on \n the pandemic on a regular basis.\u2028\n \u00b0Parents should take charge by letting their siblings know about the scourge even before they become sexually active since the highest new infections were occurring in the 6 to 18 age group. ,-\u2028Schools, peer groups and clubs should encourage young people to openly discuss the problem.\u2028\nResponsible sexual behavior should be the way forward while\u2028\n young people be encouraged to delay the onset of engaging in sexually activity\n \u00b0All leaders, particularly political, religions, cultural and\u2028\nSocietal leaders should talk about the scourge openly in all forums making HIV a priority agenda in the country."}
