{"text": "Rape: A woman's worst\nBy WANJA N. GITHINJI\nWhen June and Eric were carjacked\nearly this year in\nNgong, the last thing on their\nminds was that the gang would\nalso rape June, a mother of three.\nThey were going home at around 11pm,\nwhen men in what looked like police uniforms\nstopped them at the first set of bumps\nbefore Ngong Town. \"We thought they\nwere police officers but that was the greatest\nmistake we ever made,\" Eric narrated. The\n'policemen' quickly bundled them into the\nboot and drove to Ngong Forest where they\nstripped them naked, beat Eric unconscious\nand then raped June until she, too, lost\nconsciousness.\nWhen they came to, they were in the middle\nof nowhere so they started walking\nnaked and bare-foot looking for help. \"We\nwalked over thorns and through bushes until\nwe saw a light which led us to a house.\"\nThe couple reported the incident to Ngong\npolice but nothing has been done to-date\ndespite them presenting some evidence.\n\"June identified one of the men who raped\nher at a Lang'ata shopping centre but no\naction was taken even after we informed the\npolice.\"\nJune tested negative for HIV. She is due\nfor another test as she was told that in these\ntypes of incidents, the virus can show itself\nup much later.\nCheptoo\u00b7 another victim of rape never\nreported her case to police - her evidence\nwas washed away by the rapists. \"It was\nabout six in the evening and I was walking\nnear the bridge opposite the Railway Golf\nClub. Suddenly, I saw a man behind me\nmoving very swiftly but since he looked\nsmart, I did not suspect anything.\n\"Before I knew what was happening; the\nman grabbed me by my neck and pushed me\ninto the' tunnel under the bridge. I was raped\nby three men who pushed me into sewage\nwater and washed my private parts after they\nwere through with me. One of them told\nme, 'There, you have no evidence. What\nwill you tell the police?' Cheptoo says.\nCheptoo did not go to the police, making\nher case one of the many which go unreported.\nShe went across to a nearby petrol\n'station, told them what had happened and\nthey allowed her to call her family. She was\ntaken to hospital, given a concoction of anti-\nSTD drugs but several months later, she is\nstill sore with wounds in her private parts,\nface, mouth, not to mention the psychological\ntrauma. Fridah's\u00b7 case is one of the many complicated\nones - date rape. \"I had gone out with Frank\u00b7 for only two dates. On our third date,\nwe went out to eat nyama choma. Then\nFrank told me he needed to pick up something\nfrom his house before he dropped me\nhome. It was dark and I did not suspect anything.\"\nBe took her, to his house, locked the\ndoor and raped her.\nIn Nyeri, a widower continues to enjoy\nfreedom from prosecution for continuously\nraping his three daughters since their mother\ndied. The case was reported to the police and\nthe children's department but no action has\nbeen taken to-date.\n,Last January, Joy\u00b7 and Tito\u00b7 were heading\nto the bus station from the French Cultural\nCentre, Nairobi. As they approached the Macmillan\nLibrary, three older street boys\napproached them and floored Tito and raped\nJoy. A motorist who noticed' something fishy\nhappening as he drove by, drove back and\ncaught the boys in the act. He took the couple\nto hospital but Joy's greatest wounds are psychological. \"The purity I had held on to\nfor 25 years until I am married later this year\nwas ruined in an instant.\" The couple has\npostponed their plans as Joy is still traumatised:\nShe has also been feeling sickly but is\nscared of going for a HIV test. \"I don't want\nto be told I am HIV positive now - I will kill\nmyself if that is the case.\" Joy like many others\nneeds thorough physical and psychological\ntherapy which must be immediate after a\nrape according to Dr Nathan Thagana, a Nairobi\ngynecologist. Last month, two men who had been\ncharged before a Murang'a court\nwith defilement were found to be\nHIV -positive. The two, Naftali\nGacheru Chege, 27, and Gerald Kigunja\nNderitu, 19, were charged with defiling two\nunderage sisters who were in Standard Three\nand Four ..\nFor any woman motorist in Kenya today,\ncar-jacking has become a living nightmare few of the car-jacking victims have been\nlucky to escape without being raped. \"Rape\nhas become an epidemic now,\" Dr Thagana\nsays.\n'The above incidents are just some of the\n. very few rising cases reported to the police.\nAccording, to statistics provided by police\nspokesperson Peter Kimanthi, from the\nbeginning of th\u00a2 year to October, only\n1,241 rape cases were reported but thousands\nmore, such as Cheptoo' s, go unreported.\nIn 1996, 'the I,224 were reported,\nwhile in 1997, the figure was 1,050. There\nwas a sharp increase last year to 1,329 cases,\nwhich Mr Kirnanthi attributes to sensitisation\nof the public by various human\nrights groups. ,\nWhereas before the onset of Aids,\nwomen only had to worry about STDs and\nthe psychological trauma, a rape may today\nmean a \"death sentence,\" as South African\nAmy Brown, who was raped in front of her\nFor any woman motorist, car-jacking has become a living nightmare: Few of the female victims\nhave been lucky to escape without being raped.
