{"text": "Aids trials raise vital queries\nI have reservations about the Aids vaccine trials\ngoing on in Nairobi. The vaccine contains\nlive strains of the HIV virus that have been\nmodified to reduce their reproduction and activity.\nLittle is known about the dangers of the\ndisabled viruses.\nA renowned researcher in New England,\nMassachusetts, United States, has raised concern\nabout using inactivated HIV viruses as a\nvaccine. This kind of testing is outlawed here.\nViruses exist in the form of DNA. They\nattack white blood cells by launching a coup\nd'etat. They take charge of white blood cell\nand multiply.\nNo process can guarantee that 100 per cent\nof the viruses will be disabled in a given sample.\nInjecting a 70 per cent disabled sample\ninto a healthy one leaves 30 per cent viruses to\nmultiply. The research hopes to demonstrate\nthat the 30 per cent of the live viruses does not\nlead to development of Aids. It does not always\nwork. Beware Kenyans.\nIt would appear the researchers are out to\nexploit poor ignorant Kenyans. This raises the\nold age questions about racism.\nIbrahim Kagwima Mureu.\nBoston. US.\n\nAre Kenyans really naive or is it that we have no qualms about selling ourselves'? The idea of\ntesting an Aids vaccine appears great taken at\nface value, but the issue is why this has to be\ndone in Kenya and South Africa.\nThis calls for closer scrutiny. Granted, the\nnumber of Aids cases here is high but is this a\nreason to use Africans as guinea pigs'? There\nare hundreds of Aids cases in the United States\nand Britain. They should have. been the first\npeople on which to carry out the Aids trials.\nWith the blessing of our medical experts the\nWest can introduce anything and test it on\npeople. This is despicable and should be immediately\nstopped.\nCan the Director of Medical Services, Prof\n.Iulius Meme, make available to the public statistics\nshowing the number of individuals tested\nand levels of success or failure'? They\nshould be readily available as I assume they\nformed part of the criteria for allowing this\ntesting to be performed.\nIncidentally if these statistics existed they\nwould be public information in Britain and the\nUnited States. Does the promise of upgraded\nmedical facilities, free funding(!) and international\nrecognition outweigh African lives, Prof\nMeme'?\nIs it not strange that the drugs known to\nwork against Aids infections are deemed expensive\nand unavailable to the Third world, but\na yet untested \"vaccine\" is to be injected into  Kenyans at no cost at all to them') Except, of\ncourse. the risks involved in _testing this\nsubstance! '\nIf these researchers really care, then they\nshould make the \"expensive\" drugs available\nto us. They may certainly continue to explore\nthe \"vaccine\" possibilities in their laboratories.\nor if they wish, on their own populace.\nMilton Muigai.\nStockholm ..\nThe Kenyan volunteers to be to injected with\nthe. Aids virus stand a high chance of developing\nHIV. Why'? That vaccine has never been\ntested in the societies where it was developed, I\nbelieve that ProfMeme knows the reason.\nProf MacMichea I said that \"it will take five\nto 10 years before you and him can know\nwhether this vaccine works or fails\".\nThose poor volunteers would have to die.\nfor Prof MacMicheal to conclude that the vaccine\ndoes not work. Why sacrifice lives for experiments'?\nProf Meme, it's your job to protect the\nhealth of all Kenyans as the man in charge of\nmedical services. It is, therefore. surprising\nthat the OMS is offering his fellow Kenyans\nfor life-threatening experimental trials, and\nworst bf all, in exchange for \"international\nrecognition\" . Doris Adhiambo.\nUnited States.\nIgnorance fuelling HIV spread\nMuch has been said and many\nnewspaper articles and books\nwritten on the Aids scourge, but\nthe. solution or cure remains elusive\nworldwide.\nAids, as many have come to\nrealise, is a condition that grips\nand reduces a once healthy person\nto a mere walking skeleton! It is a\ndreadful thing that must be fought\nby all in society.\nEducative books have been\nwritten and awareness campaigns\nmounted to curb against the\nspread of HIV/Aids, in vain.\nWhy? Because it is not easy to\nchange man's attitude.\nWhile we know most of the\ncases of this killer disease in'\nKenya have been spread through\nsexual intercourse, we continue to\nbury our heads in the sand, not\nwilling to change our sexual\nbehaviour.\nAs we approach the next century, we should try to eradicate ignorance.\nAlso, the issue of making\nourselves popular for a little while\nshould be done away with for it\nmakes us regret later.\nI was surprised to hear that\nsome people are shocked to learn\nthat there are still misconceptions\namong our people (especially illiterate\nrural inhabitants) about\nAids. In some remote hinterlands\nof Bungoma and Busia districts,\nsome people still believe that Aids is a curse from God or something\nto do with the family planning\ncampaign.\nRecently, some members and\nofficials of a non-governmental\norganisation escaped unhurt when\nrowdy locals in Bungoma confronted\nand threatened to cut them\nup.\nThey said they would not allow\nthese people to preach about a\nnon-existent Aids threat. To these\npeople, the Aids campaign is a\nploy to deny them their sexual enjoyment.\nIt is these people who indeed\nrequire thorough education about\nthe Aids menace.\nParents, teachers, leaders and\ncounsellors should be on the\nfrontline in campaigns to discuss\nAids, especially at forums for\nyoung people.\nIt is painful to note that as the\nnumber of those afflicted with\nAids increases, many young\npeople are being forced out of\nschools and colleges to look after\ntheir sick parents at home.\nWananchi should understand\nthat Aids is there. It should be understood\nthat it is found everywhere,\nnot only in the towns. It is\nin remote areas like Ndivisi, Kamukuywa\nor Malakisi in Bungoma\nDistrict.'\nAntony Onglao Nyongesa.\nKimilili."}
