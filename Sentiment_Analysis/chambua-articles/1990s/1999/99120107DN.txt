{"text": "Condoms: Was\nbishop serious?\nBishop John Njue's comment that\nthe use of condoms is to blame\nfor the Aids epidemic ravaging\nAfrica (DN, Nov2) illustrates the\nCatholic hierarchy's continued\ninsensitivity to scientific fact and\nhuman suffering. '\nThe effectiveness of condoms\n. in preventing the spread 'of Aids\nis an undisputed fact. A major\nreview of the foremost studies in\nthe past few years on the' efficacy\nof condoms use by Johns Hopkins University, a prestigious US\nteaching and research hospital,\nconcluded that \"condoms provide\nhighly effective protection\nagainst HIV infection when used\ncorrectly.\"\nBishop Njue's' attitude that\nonly monogamy provides protection\nagainst Aids is' unrealistic\nand morally reprehensible in a\nnation where the HIV infection\nrate is approaching 30 per cent in\nsome areas.\nThis unrealistic ban on contraceptive\nuse has been discredited\nby the actions of millions of\nCatholics around the world who\nUse condoms and other contraceptives\nwhen they have access to\nthem. However, in many parts of\nthe developing world, including\nAfrica, the Vatican uses its special\nposition in the UN to prevent\naccess to contraceptives and family\nplanning services. This robs\nmillions of the ability to plan\ntheir families and protect themselves\nfrom Aids.\nBishop Njue and the Catholic\nhierarchy would do well to follow\nthe humanitarian example of the\nFrench and German bishops who\nhave recognised the moral\nimperative of allowing the use of\ncondoms to prevent the spread of\nAids, and allow the Catholic\nfaithful to make their own decisions\nabout condom use.\nFrances Kissling.\nPresident.\nCatholics For a Free Choice.
