{"text": "Public needs facts on condoms\nThat HIV/Aids is a national disaster is a gross\nunderstatement. It is indeed a national emergency. Already more than 800,000 Kenyans\nhave died. Even with the unbelievable underreporting\nand under projection, about two million\nKenyans are infected.\nIf the 1994 state of Aids in Kenya estimates\nare used for projection, it would mean that\nactually, 3.4 to 4 million Kenyans are currently\ninfected with the disease.\nOne of the weapons offered for the fight\nagainst this monster is the condom. More and\nmore leaders are coming out in support of the\ncondom but in both print and electronic\nmedia, there is no information at all about\nwhat really the condoms are. How effective\nand ineffective they are and the information\nnecessary to help the Kenyans make an\ninformed decision of whether or not to use\ncondoms.\nThe way condoms are being promoted misleads\nthe public because the basic facts are\nwithheld. Some of these facts include:- o Condoms were initially designed to prevent\npregnancy: Studies for the last 40 years\nespecially have repeatedly shown that they\nhave an unacceptably high failure rate for this.\nThese failure rates range from 10-30 per cent. This is despite the fact that pregnancy can\nonly result from coitus during the fertile\nphase. a period ranging from one to about five\ndays in the normal menstrual cycle. This\ntranslates to about only 18 per cent of the\nlength of the cycle. On the other hand. HIV\ncan be transmitted all the days of the menstrual\ncycle. This would make the failure for\nHIV transmission much higher - may be\nbeyond 50 per cent. o Condoms break during use: Two large well\ncontrolled studies involving over 6.000 experienced\ncondom users in a clinic at Birmingham,\nUK reported that 52% of the participants\nreported breakage during intercourse in the\npreceding three months. Users need this information\nclearly stated. for them to make\ninformed decisions. o Spilling of seminal fluid: In 1990, a Canadian\nconsultant, Dr Richard Gordon carried\nout the famous Red Eve Test. A number of\nmarried couples who agreed to participate in\ntesting of condoms had a harmless red dye\ninserted into the tips of the condoms prior to\nintercourse. After each coitus in which, the\nman withdrew whilst fully erect, it was found\nthat the red dye had leaked over the rim and\ninto the birth canal of all the women who participated. o Condoms have pores (holes): ('. M.\nRoland. in a study published in the top rated\nrubber professional journal Rubber World\nVol 208 No.3 of June 1993, titled \"The barrier\nperformance of latex rubber\", revealed\nthat latex rubber has tiny miscroscopic naturally\noccuring pores or holes when latex rubber\nis moulded to the thickness of the condom.\nThese pores measure between 4 and 10\nmicrons in\u00b7 diameter with an average of 7\nmicrons. HIV is only 0.1 microns in diameter.\nA 7 microns hole is 70 times larger than the\nHIV. The virus will easily pass through has if\nthe rubber was not there. o Slipping off: This is one of the commonest\n\"accidents\" to occur with the condom. This\nhappens when there is a delay in withdrawal\nand erection is lost. A lot of health care providers\nwill remember occasions when the condoms\nhave to be fished from the birth canal.\nOther facts that the public need to be aware\nof include storage and climatic changes: damages\ncaused to condoms by use of oil-based\nlubricants by sexual partners and the quality\nof the condoms.\nDr Stephen K.Karanja."}
