{"text": "Saitoti to NGOs: Let us work together\nBy MAGUTA KIMEMIA\nNon-Governmental Organisations play a major role in national development and there should be no confrontation between them and the Government, Cabinet Mimster George Saitoti said yesterday.\n\"There is no more room for confrontation between the government and NGOs as we say goodbye to the 20th Century. The 21st Century should be characterized by participation not confrontation,\"\nProf Saitoti said. Prof Saitoti, who is the Minister for Planning and National Development, was officially opening a two-day regional NGO preparatory meeting for the East and Southern Africa follow-up conference to the World Summit for Social Development, at the Kenya College of Communications Technology in Mbagathi.\nThe meeting, organised by the\nNGO Council and Action-Aid\nKenya with financial support of\nthe United Nations Development\nProgramme (UNDP), was to give\nthe NGO sector an opportunity to\nprepare and reach a consensus on\nwhat its role has been in the goals\nof the 1995 Copenhagen Declaration\non Social Development.\nThe declaration's goals include\npoverty reduction, employment\ncreation and expansion of access\nto social services through enhanced public spending and social\nparticipation.\nProf Saitoti said Africa was\nfaced with a serious crisis partly\nbecause of low economic growth\nrates.\nThe problems of poverty, he\nnoted, had been compounded by\nnew challenges such as the HIV,\nAids pandemic and the erosion of'\nsafety nets as countries adjusted\ntheir economies to conform with\nglobal reforms.\nProf Saitoti said the National\nPoverty Eradication Plan\nlaunched by President Moi recently, was intended to address major\ndevelopment challenges such as\nprovision of basic education,\nhealth care, water, sanitation and\nnutrition.\nIn order for these challenges to\nbe met in an environment of declining\nresources, citizens must\nhave a stake in economic progress.\n\"What is emerging is a need for\na cooperative attitude between development partners and stakeholders\nwith the special abilities\nof each being recognised and appreciated,\"\nProf Saitoti said.\nUNDP resident representative\nFrederick Lyons said the goal of\neradicating poverty was both an\nover-riding priority and moral necessity.\nAlthough poverty eradication\nwas within people's reach,\nit could not be done without peace\nand stability, he said.\nMr Lyons called for consistent\npolicies to fight poverty.\nDefining poverty as a denial of\npeople's opportunities and\nchoices to lead long, healthy and\ncreative lives and to enjoy decent\na standard of living, Mr Lyons\ncalled on governments to formulate\npolicies which allowed their\npeople to enjoy basic rights.\n\"Only determined and consistent\naction at the policy and operational levels\nwill reduce poverty, \"\nthe UNDP official said.\nMs Alice Mudiri-Ogolla of the\nNGO Council blamed poverty on\nfailure of governments to implement\nWorld Social Summit on\nDevelopment recommendations.\nShe attributed poor implementation\nto lack of resources, dwindling\nbilateral assistance, poor\ngovernance and bad policies,\namong others.\nShe said huge debts and SAPS\nhad proved to be big burdens particularly\nto the poor, making it\nnecessary to come up with programmes\nto cater for vulnerable\ngroups."}
