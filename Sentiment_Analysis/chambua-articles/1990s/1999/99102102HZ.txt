{"text": "Fishing fueling sexual exploitation\nFishing, which is not only a way of life for the Luos, but\nalso a means of livelihood has for decades offered\nemployment opportunities for many. Nonetheless,\nCLAY MUGANDA found out in Bondo, that on-the beach\nfish processing leads to sexual exploitation of\nteenage girls, exposing them to HIV /Aids.\nEven though the fishing industry\noffers employment opportunities\nto many, local tourism that\ncomes with it encourages\nexploitation and abuse of children,\nespecially girls.\nIn the newly-created district\nof Bondo, in Nyanza Province,\nthere is a rise in the number of\nchild families, thanks to the\nflourishing fishing industry.\nWhen parents go fishing, young\ngirls are left to look after their\nyounger siblings, denying them\na chance to attend school.\n\"Such a situation tends to\nmake the girls feel mature and\nthey are bound to take decisions,\nwhich might be detrimental to\ntheir overall wellbeing,\" Owino\nKanam, the Usigu division\ninspector of schools, told IRIS.\n\"Even though fishing is a\nman's domain, fish processing\nactivities like cleaning,\nsmoking, drying and frying\nare left to women. In\nmost cases, a large\nnumber of women engage\nin what is locally referred\nto as tich odingi (retailing\nfor fishermen on commission\nbasis).\" .\n\"Such traditional stereotypical\ndivision of labour\nhas brought, an influx of\nwomen looking for\n. employment in the beaches,\"\nsays Peter Omuombo,\nthe Uhanya. Primary\nSchool head. In order to\nincrease their earnings,\nthe teacher adds, the women\ntake a number of these petty\njobs at one particular time and\n'sub-let' them to young girls or\ntheir daughters .....\nEateries and drinking Joints\nset up to cater for the fishermen\nand transporters offer constant\nclientele for flesh peddlers.\nBecause of the belief that young\ngirls are free from sexually\ntransmitted infections (STIs)\nand HIV/Aids, fishermen and\ntransporters prefer young girls to\ntheir' older counterparts for sexual\nescapades.\nCoupled with peer pressure\nand the urge to make quick\nmoney young girls have succumbed\nto prostitution. Indeed, along the beaches, commercial\nsex workers (CSWs), aged as\nyoung as 19 years, are referred to\nas mon moti (haggards) and are,\ntherefore, not favoured by sex\nhunters. Women employers,\nmostly single mothers who also\ndabble in prostitution, keep teenage\ngirls in their business joints\nto entice male customers.\nThe situation is compounded by the fact that fishermen and\ntransporters, with a high purchasing\npower but with little to buy\nalong the beaches, readily pay\nyoung girls for sexual favours,\nthus exposing them to STIs and\nHIV/Aids. Nine out often people\nin Africa with HIV/Aids do' not\nknow they are infected and those\nwho know rarely tell their sex\npartners,\nStudies by United Nations\nChildren's Fund (Unicef) say the\nphysical and psychological abuse\ninflicted by commercial sex\nexploitation makes it one of, the\nmost hazardous forms of child\nlabour. No matter how high the\nwages or how few the hours, the children involved have to confront\nserious health risks everyday,\nincluding respiratory diseases,\nunwanted pregnancies, STls\nand HIV/Aids. They are also\nplunged into distorted reality in\nwhich violence and distrust,\nshame and rejection are the\nnorms.\nAccording to the United\nNations' 1999 Progress of\nNations, a study in Western\nKenya found that 25\npercent of girls aged\nbetween 15 and 19 years\nwere HIV-positive compared\nto only four percent\nboys in the same age group. The publication\nfurther says that discrepancies\nin HIV r3;tes\nbetween girls and boys\nindicate that. girls are\nmore likely to be\ninfected by older men\nthan by boys of' their\nown age,\nHigher HIV prevalence\namong girls reflect their\nbiological vulnerability to infection,\ntheir social \u00b7and physical vulnerability\nin sexual relations and\nthe impact of gender\ndiscrimination.\n\"Because there is so much\nmoney floating along the beaches,\nthe social life is very high,\"\nobserves the inspector of schools.\nThe Kenya Institute. of Education\n(KIE) curriculum developer adds\nthat the fishing industry has had a\nnegative impact on early child\ndevelopment as the local tourism\nbrought about by it encourages\nyoung girls to engage in inappropriate\nrelationships in the name of\ndoing business. The eateries and drinking joints, on the other hand,\nalso offer employment opportunities\nfor young girls. Proprietors\nprefer to employ young girls\nbecause they are diligent, fast and\ndemand less pay than their older\ncounterparts.\nUnicef in Stale of the World's\nChildren 1997 notes that children\nare employed because. they are\neasier to exploit, are malleable and\nmore powerless. Thus, they can be\nphysically abused without striking\nback. Further, children work\nbecause they do not have the\npower of free choice. Unicef notes\nthat children are pushed into work\nthat is most damaging to their\ndevelopment by three key factors:\nthe exploitation of poverty; the\nabsence of education and the\nrestrictions of tradition.\nMs Rose Okinyo, a commission\nagent at the 'Uhanya beach blames\nfathers and husbands for the young\ngirls' predicament. She says some fathers force their wives and\ndaughters to engage in fish\nprocessing activities because they\ndo not provide for their families.\n\"Thus women call in their daughters\nto help in order to increase\ntheir savings and provide for the\nfamily:' adds the single mother of\ntwo,\nAnd because of cheap housing,\ngirls who 'have made their bones'\nat the beach easily afford to rent\ntheir own accommodation. Cheap\nhousing also encourages single\nmotherhood as women dissatisfied\nwith their husbands easily\npay for their own living quarters.\nSingle mothers, in turn encourage\nearly child independence and, by\ninference, sexual activity by renting\nhouses for them.\n\"What we have here is a\nvicious circle of prostitution,\"\nobserves Ms Alice Osweta. \"Prostitution\nbegets single motherhood begets exploitation of girls begets\nprostitution,\" argues the deputy\nhead at Uhanya Primary School.\n\"Because of this economic\nindependence, most single mothers\nhere have children with different\nfathers:' says Samson Onyango,\na beach leader at Usenge. He\ntold IRIS: \"Bearing in mind that\nbeach areas are places of constant\ninteraction with people from different\nplaces, girls from such single parentage are bound to\nbecome promiscuous because of\nlong periods of absence by their\nmothers when they go on business\ntrips.\"\nEven though economics is the\nmost powerful force behind child\nprostitution, traditions and\nentrenched social patterns play\ntheir part.\nAn IRIS Feature \n\nBecause of cheap housing,\ngirls who 'have made their\nbones' at the beach easily\nafford to rent their own\naccommodation .. Single\nmothers, in turn encourage\nearly child independence by\nrenting houses for them.\nLake Victoria: Because there is so much money floating along the beaches, the social life is very.\nhigh. Women employers, mostly single mothers who also dabble in prostitution, keep teenage girls m\ntheir business joints to entice male customers."}
