{"text": "22 09 99\n\n\nBy MARY MAKOKHA\nShe cut a figure of dejection as she held the infant at Butula Mission Hospital. A nurse had to remind her to change and cover the. baby.\nCrippled and orphaned Veronica\nAketch conceived when she was raped in an\nAids cleansing ritual at her home in Busia.\nVeronica lost both parents at age 10. She and her brother were left under the care a,\n68-year-old aunt whose' son is a miracle healer.\nHe's believed to pray for people with Aids in\nBusia.\nMany people seeking to be healed of Aids have consulted the healer. His prescription is,\n\"Rape a virgin and your health status will immediately transform from being HIV positive to HIV negative.\" This ritual cleansing has pulled quite a following. The mission is to tell his patients that they have been bewitched with Aids. As news of his 'healing prowess' spread far and wide, many infected men have got a new hope in this new wave of healing they believe what he tells them.\nTen months ago, a man from Busia town went to be healed. And that is when Veronica's tribulations started.\n\"I did not know what the man's problem was. I don't even know his name. But I was alone with him.\nEverybody else had deserted the compound.\nThen he repeatedly raped me,\" she said.\nThe result of rape 'was conception.\nNine months later she got a child. The uncle and the rapist are stil1 going on with their business. They have not been arrested.\nAsked about the whereabouts Veronica's aunt says: \"He is in the world praying for people.\"\nShe claims' she does not know how to trace her son or the man who defiled the orphan;\nThe nurse on duty who had talked to the woman who took Veronica to hospital says of the aunt: \"That old woman is hiding something.\nThere is a hidden agenda here.\u201d\nThe Butula parish priest Father Leonard\nEkisa is calling for justice in Veronica's case.\nHe recommended that the baby be taken to an orphanage, something that\nVeronica's aunt is opposed to. \"I can take care of this baby at home,\" she, says.\nWithout HIV/Aids education in Busia, many people have resorted to these dangerous beliefs and practices. There are those who have refused to accept that Aids has no cure and they throng magicians' s abysses, seeking treatment.\nThe magicians are having a field day, making money out of the ignorance of the people.\nOne of the three women village heads at the chief's baraza in Busiada village explained how a woman in the village lost over Sh70,000 to a magician who was supposed to cure her of Aids.\nHowever, those 'who go to miracle healers\n(abasai) for prayers continue playing a major\nrole in transmitting the deadly virus. In one village a miracle healer advised a man who had tested positive to look for a young virgin and marry her to cleanse himself of the virus. The man, his wife and baby have since died \u2013 no miracle cure.\nWith the rise in HIV prevalence in Busia, cases' of rape and child sexual abuse are on the increase. The Butula District Officer Kiprop .\nLokorio says he tried to follow up a case of a girl who was removed from primary school and married off to an HIV positive man, but- the girl's relatives concealed information.\n\"It is unfortunate that those concerned are unwilling to cooperate in curbing this deadly, attitude. Marrying off such 'young girls to HIV positive men is tantamount to signing their\ndeath warrants,\" says Lokorio.\nThe impact of HIV in Busia is rearing its ugly head. The people have now accepted the reality of Aids but unfortunately for many, the realisation has come too late.\nThe biggest problem is the rising number of orphans. There has been a big drop in pupils' population and enrolment has rapidly decreased, says the deputy headmaster of Bwarilo Primary School.\n\"The school had 700 pupils a few years ago but today it has\n400. This is because of children dropping out following the death of parents. Sending a child home of her son for a pencil might be the end of that child's education,\" he said.\nThe Siguli non-informal school started by\nEvangelist Peter Akula takes care of 220 Aids orphans. The school has no classrooms and the children study under a tree.\nJoshua Ondenyo, the school\u2019s headmaster says every day they receive three 'to five children\nof nursery age who are sick.\n\"They come in the morning looking fine then suddenly develop a fever\n.\" he says. ,\nAids awareness is needed to educate people about Aids so that the ritual healing can stop, says Rural Education and, Economic\nEnhancement programme (REEP) co-ordinator\nMary Wafula. '\nShe says REEP has been organising campaigns\nbut a lot remains to be done to change . behaviour:\nWhile Veronica is still traumatised and unaware that she's HIV positive, the rapist\nwho is known in the community is still at large\n- perhaps raping other virgins and spreading the fatal disease. \nVeronica is not the only victim of the Aids trail. Many infected people in Busia do not, want to die alone but want to go to the grave with as many people as they possibly can. A man who discovered he had contracted the disease decided to spread it. He raped his own mother! And before the community came to terms with this abomination, the man went ahead and raped his sister, sisters-in-law and any woman he came across. And proudly said that he will not die alone.\nA teenager who also discovered that she was HIV positive went on a spread the virus spree.  She befriended married men to 'revenge'. Whim an offended wife reproached her for going with her husband she arrogantly told her, \"You are too late, madam. I am going to the grave with your husband and you too are in the wagon and will follow soon.\" As the people with the scourge continue to infect the innocent, for how long shall we sit and watch?\nWhen will the Government come up with a legislation to curb the malicious spread of Aids. What happened to the sessional paper on Aids in Kenya tabled in Parliament in I997?"}
