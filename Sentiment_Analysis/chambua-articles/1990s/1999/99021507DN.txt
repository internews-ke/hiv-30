{"text": "HIV vaccine trials a grave risk\nThe live attenuated (very slow)\nHIV viruses to be used in vaccine\ntrials will not prevent, cure or\ngreatly reduce infection.\nFor the past five years, I have\nworked with several teams around\nthe world trying to create a possible\ntherapy to reduce the rate of\ninfection and improve health of\nthose infected. I'm familiar with\nthis purported technique and a\nbetter and safer one.\nThis involves synthesised peptide\nfragments from several hundred\ndifferent isotypes (varieties)\nof HIV-gpI20 (gp 120 is part of\nthe external coat of the virus\nwhich mutates), providing a greater\nexposure of varying anti gents\nthat will reduce the viral load and\nin some, quite substantially. But\neven this technique has its drawbacks.\nThere is a small chance of\nalso activating an auto-immune\nresponse induced by the peptide\nfragments.\nThe HIV virus is mutating faster\nthan the body can recognise the\nnew varieties. Depending on your\ntissue type (HLA) you will be\nmore or less susceptible to the\nprogress of the virus. This has\nbeen in a few cases around the\nworld, including those seen in\nprostitutes in Kenya shown to be\nHIV positive without developing\nAids.\nDuring HIV virus infection,\nlet's assume one has been infected\nwith 100 of the same HIV isotype\n(VI). These viruses will move\naround the body looking for a host preferring mainly T cells (a type\nof white cell). Most of the viruses\nwould be eliminated by the white\ncells. If one escaped and infected\na T cell, that virus will mature and\nproduce continually new HIV isotypes.\nThe body may be resistant\nto the original virus (VI) but now\nit has many new isotypes to deal\nwith.\nThe Nairobi project is trying to\nobserve if the live attenuated\n(slow) virus would induce an immune\nreaction that would provide\nvaccine like properties.\nThe attenuated viruses injected\ninto the volunteer will induce a\nnormal immune reaction. The\nbody will develop protective immunity\nto that particular isotype.\nBut what about the the other millions\nof types of isotypes that you\nneed protection against? There is\nalso a chance with all attenuated\nviral vaccines of developing a\nmild form of the disease and a risk\nthat the virus could mutate back\ninto its aggressive state.\nThe major problem is that a\nnormal uninfected volunteer will\nbe infected with HIV and the already\ninfected volunteer could get\nfull blown Aids. HIV, being a Retrovirus,\ncan also cause cancer.\nIn the West such tests on humans\nare not allowed. Kenyans\nmust be aware of the risk 'involved.\nFor more information on\nHIV/Aids: email.jangi@cyberkenya.\ncom.\nJehangir Sheikh,\nNairobi"}
