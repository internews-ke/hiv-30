Total Kenya has began 8 countrywide HIV/AIDS campaign to inform and educate its staff on the dangers \u2028\nand impact of the disease. \u2028\nimproving the standards of \u2028\nliving in communities they \u2028\nwork \u2028\nAt the end of the 1994 Cairo \u2028\nconference, various countries \u2028\nfrom the South - Latin America, \u2028\nAsia, Middle East and \u2028\nSub-Saharan Africa formed an \u2028\nalliance - The Partners in \u2028\nPopulation and Development. \u2028\nThese were countries that had \u2028\nmade significant progress in \u2028\npopulation programmes. They \u2028\nsought to share their \u2028\nexperiences for the common \u2028\ngood of peoples in the 'South'. \u2028\nThis alliance, also referred to \u2028\nas the South to South Initiative, \u2028\nis an inter-governmental \u2028\norganisation, to which Kenya is \u2028\nGovernments and civil \u2028\nsociety organisations, \u2028\nwhere appropriate, are \u2028\nencouraged to design \u2028\ninnovative approaches \u2028\nand build partnerships \u2028\nwith, among others the \u2028\nmedia, the commercial \u2028\nsector, religious leaders, \u2028\nlocal community groups \u2028\nand leaders RS well as \u2028\nyouth, which can serve as \u2028\neffective advocates for the \u2028\nachievement of the goals \u2028\nand objectives Of the \u2028\nProgram of Action. \u2028\nKey actions for the \u2028\nfurther implementation of \u2028\nthe ICPD, United Nations \u2028\nGeneral Assembly 1999 \u2028\nNeed for a multi- \u2028\nSub-Saharan Africa is facing reproductive health \u2028\nproblems. One in every 16 women in Africa is at risk Of dying \u2028\nfrom pregnancy and infant mortality stands at per every \u2028\n1000 children born in Eastern Africa. \u2028\nThe HIV/Aids pandemic is erasing many of the health gains \u2028\nmade in the 1980s. The 1994 International Conference On \u2028\nPopulation and Development (ICPD) held in Cairo stated that it \u2028\nis possible to world population growth by attending to \u2028\npeople's health needs and respecting their rights and needs to \u2028\nreproductive health Care. \u2028\nThis means that the new approach focused on reproductive \u2028\nhealth rather than family planning and population control. \u2028\nbeing in all matters related to the reproductive \u2028\nsystem. Reproductive health care includes: \u2028\n- prenatal, postnatal and delivery care \u2028\n- treatment Of reproductive tract infections and sexually \u2028\ntransmitted diseases \u2028\nprevention Of and appropriate treatment for infertility \u2028\nInformation, education and counselling or. sexuality. \u2028\nReproductive health and responsible parenthood and \u2028\ndiscouragement of harmful practices, like female genital: \u2028\nmutilation (FGM) \u2028\nfamily planning services, counselling information \u2028\nprevention of unsafe abortion and management of \u2028\nabortion-related complications. \u2028\nsector approach \u2028\nAdditional services include treatment of breast and \u2028\nreproductive system cancers and HIV/Aids. \u2028\nPartnerships have been identified as an important strategy to \u2028\nimprove reproductive health services and ultimately \u2028\nreproductive health. Partnerships between two or more \u2028\norganisations can be an effective means for achieving better \u2028\nhealth standards. It is widely believed that if governments \u2028\nNGOs and the private Sector worked in partnership they can \u2028\naccomplish more than they can separately and can also \u2028\nimprove their own capacities for sustainable development. It \u2028\nwould be possible to reduce infant and maternal mortality and \u2028\nmorbidity, increase the use of modern family planning \u2028\nmethods, improve access to primary health cafe for \u2028\nunderserved groups, combating the HIV/ Aids epidemic, \u2028\nreduce teen pregnancy and provide cost-effective, \u2028\nhigh-quality, sustainable health services. \u2028\nThere is increasing awareness that inter-sectorial \u2028\npartnerships are also an economical option tc providing health \u2028\nservices. Financial resources are constantly or the decline and \u2028\norganisations, are not always able cc provide the whole range \u2028\nhealth care services. \u2028\nOrganisations are focusing or; specific areas and \u2028\nrequire counterparts to offer \"the\" services. Other catalysts \u2028\ninclude and economic reforms including health sector \u2028\nreform. \u2028\na member and represented by International Council for Population \u2028\nand Development\u2028\nThe objective is improve population and \u2028\nreproductive health programme; developing countries by \u2028\ninformation and sharing experiences \u2028\namong partner countries. \u2028\nThe initiative has identified the need to include NGOs in South \u2028\nto South collaboration. The \u2028\nPartners aim at developing a \u2028\nsimilar alliance among NGOs \u2028\nto implement reproductive \u2028\nhealth development in Africa, \u2028\nAsia, Middle East and Latin \u2028\nAmerica. \u2028\nThe purpose Of the NGO \u2028\nalliance would be to identify \u2028\nsuccessful experiences, \u2028\nstrengthen and expand NGO \u2028\ncapacity to contribute more \u2028\neffectively to reproductive \u2028\nhealth care. \u2028\nThe partner countries have \u2028\nstarted to develop a formal \u2028\nnetwork in which NGOs and \u2028\ngovernments will work together \u2028\nto promote South to South \u2028\ncollaboration. \u2028\nFour NGOs spearhead this \u2028\nproposed network, one per \u2028\nregion, with the Centre for \u2028\nDr \u2028\nAfrican Family Studies working \u2028\nfor sub-Saharan Africa. \u2028\nThe Conference on NGO Partnerships for \u2028\nreproductive health \u2028\nDr Florence Manguyu, Chair \u2028\nConference Steering \u2028\nCommittee \u2028\nMany government departments, NGOs and the \u2028\nprivate sector work to improve the health of \u2028\ncommunities. However, these different sectors do \u2028\nnot necessarily communicate or work in \u2028\npartnership. Establishing good communications \u2028\nbetween sectors and organisations is the first step \u2028\nin developing a partnership. \u2028\nNetworking is an important mechanism to \u2028\nstimulate communication and collaboration and \u2028\npromote South to South partnership. \u2028\nThe conference brings together representatives \u2028\nfrom NGOs, public and private sectors to stimulate \u2028\ncommunication and collaboration. The activities at \u2028\nthe conference will include plenary sessions, group \u2028\ndiscussions and an exhibition. The forum will \u2028\ncollectively identify priority areas for partnerships \u2028\nand draw up strategies to make partnerships \u2028\nsuccessful. \u2028\nconference will define partnership and \u2028\ndevelop a common understanding to enable \u2028\norganisations co-ordinate their work together \u2028\nIn order to successfully implement \u2028\npartnerships, mechanisms to bridge divisions \u2028\nsuch as borders, languages and \u2028\ncommunication links Will need to be \u2028\ndeveloped \u2028\nSome prerequisites for partnership include \u2028\nmutual respect, trust and understanding - thus \u2028\nthe need for good governance and \u2028\naccountability. This theme will look at \u2028\nbottle-necks to partnership that are created by \u2028\norganisational structures and leadership. \u2028\nForming partnerships will be discussed \u2028\nwithin a comprehensive reproductive health \u2028\ncontext. Issues to be included when looking at \u2028\ncomprehensive health are gender and \u2028\nadolescent concerns. \u2028\nAt the end of the conference, participants \u2028\nwill develop a framework for partnership \u2028\nwhich will involve the sharing Of information \u2028\nand innovations. \u2028\nPape Syr Diagne, Director "}
