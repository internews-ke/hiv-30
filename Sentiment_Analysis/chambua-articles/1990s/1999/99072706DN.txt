{"text": "Boost grassroot anti-Aids campaign\nThere is no longer any doubt that Aids poses, a serious\nhealth and social problem in the country today. It is estimated that since the first case\u00b7:o f the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome was first diagnosed in Kenya over a decade ago, more than 200,000 people have perished.\nThe fast spread of the scourge around the country is evident in the latest statistics from health workers, It is said\nthat in the public hospitals, Aids patients today occupy\nabout half of the beds available. This would appear to lend\ncredence to the estimate of two million people infected\nwith the Aids-causing HIV virus.\nSince the main mode of transmission in our country is\nheterosexual intercourse, the menace is being severely felt in the 18 to 50 age group. This is a worrying trend, considering that this also happens to be the most productive segment\nof the society. \" .\nAs it continues to knock on the doors of many families,\nthe repercussions of the Aids threat are being felt in industry.\nMany an employer has lost either highly trained or\nskilled staff to this pandemic. It me.ans that the employers \nhave to train other people over relatively shorter periods to\ntake over the vacancies created.\nAt the current rate of infection, it is estimated that nearly\na million people will have died by the turn of the century.\nAids is no longer the Joke many people through it was\nsome five or so years ago. They have seen It claim their\nown relatives, close friends or colleagues.\nBut despite the heavy toll Aids has already exacted and\nthe awareness campaign through the media, there are pockets of appalling ignorance about It. An Aids symposium in Western Province was told that some men. believe that\nhaving sex with teenagers can cure their infection.\nThe people, especially in the rural areas, need\u00b7 to .know\nso that they may not waste their resources on herbalists or\nselfstyled preachers promising to cure the sick., .\nThe western Kenya symposium and a leaders campaign\nin Central Province are efforts that should be encouraged\nand supported. The leaders, including MPs, have a lot of\ninfluence in their communities and beyond. If they can be\nseriously involved in the anti-Aids campaign, the effort to\nroll back Aids will be speeded up."}
