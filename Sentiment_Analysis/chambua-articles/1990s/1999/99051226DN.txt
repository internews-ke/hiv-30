He deserves a medal for his\u2028\n kindness. He races to to\u2028\ndistrict surgeon\u2019s offices \u2014\u2028\n it\u2019s like entering a scene from the\u2028\n gloomiest and most terrifying\u2028\n pages of George Orwell\u2019s 1984.\u2028\n We battled locater, and then\u2028\n drive through darkness to the bad\u2028\n of the now empty hospital. Loud\u2028\n music thumps a party some\u2028\n where nearby. There are no lights\u2028\n outside the district surgeon\u2019s  no bell to press. The police\u2028\n officer bangs on the windows until two security guards come and\u2028\n battle to open the door. We go in;\u2028\n a police officer from the child\u2028\n protection unit is there. A Child\u2028\n under the age of IS who has been\u2028\n raped is being examined.\u2028\n The lighting is dim. it is like a\u2028\n Third World airport, h bus no\u2028\n phone, no water or tea or anything\u2028\n for victims or police. Rows of\u2028\n benches are shoved against \u2028\n walls, with filing cabinets, desks.\u2028\n li looks like a furniture storage\u2028\n depot. A narrow three-panel\u2028\nshields eyes from\u2028\n victims. Pamphlets titled \nOur Hopes, Nelson Mandela\u2019s final speech, are scattered on\u2028\n one table. There are others about\u2028\n Rosubank Vaccination Station,\u2028\n nothing about how to cope after\u2028\n sexual assault.\u2028\n There is not AZT there \u2014 how\u2028\n could I forget, Minister Nkoua\u2028\n zuna Zaina, a woman too, won\u2019t\u2028\n allow the government \u2028\n AZT to rape victims and pregnant\u2028\n women to reduce transmission of\u2028\n the disease to their babies, \u2028\n rapist bestows a death sentence\u2028\n and the state, by refusing ro give\u2028\n cheap medication that could save\u2028\n many women, becomes executioner.\u2028\n Officers from the sexual of-\u2028\n fences unit arrive. They want to\u2028\n take a statement and for me to an\u2028\n undergo an examination by the district surgeon first. It has now been\u2028\n two hours since the rape. t refuse\u2028\n o comply with anything until I\u2028\n get AZT. which my guardian an\u2028\n gel in the form of Constable \u2028\n has now discovered is at Garden\u2028\n City Clinic, t have cards for \u2028\n cat Rescue International (MRt) in\u2028\n my handbag. I phone them, I tell\u2028\n them happened, they leave\u2028\n me holding on for a while and\u2028\n then speak to the police officer\u2028\n and arrange to cover payment. If I\u2028\n don\u2019t have HIV it\u2019s because MRI\u2028\n and a concerned young policeman\u2028\n cared.\u2028\n Constable Lond races me across\u2028\n to the clinic, H takes t receptionist aside and tells her what has\u2028\n happened and the name of the\u2028\n contact person at clinic who\u2028\n has given approval for the dreg.\u2028\n She says she does not know of\u2028\n any sack person. This, by the\u2028\n way, is the clinic where ill had\u2028\n injured my rapist and he was taken prisoner he would have been\u2028\n admitted without question and\nThe bathroom where \n treated free at the state\u2019s \u2028\n I\u2019m desperate. \u2028\n across, \u201cThis is my life we are\u2028\n talking about.

I grab a passing doctors\u2019 and tait him lured help. \u2028\n says he can\u2019t help and the doctor\u2028\n n charge is notating. I become\u2028\n threatening. Ile goes into where\u2028\n the doctor in. The doctor comes\u2028\n out \u2014 I tell him the time that has\u2028\n lapsed since the rape and that \u00a1\u2028\n need AZT fast. He orders the\u2028\n drags, and says another woman\u2028\nhas been stabbed with a nee\u2028\nneeds it and they have\u2028\n summoned the pharmacist.\u2028\n t go into a cubicle to wait. The\u2028\n doctor comes by half-an-hoar tat\u2028\n Cr and offers me tea. He in the\u2028\n first person to do so. At Mitpark\u2028\n slaked my dry mouth by drinking\u2028\n from a tap. It takes one-and-a-hot\u2028\n hours before the drags arise. It j\u2028\nthat there is not fast\u2028\n access to anti-retrovirals in casually for needlestick injuries and\u2028\n rape victims.
