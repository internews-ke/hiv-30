{"text": "More girls have HIV than boys, says report\nBy NATION Correspondent\nThere are more girls than boys who are HIV-positive in Kenya, a United Nation's Children's Fund report says.\nThe report, tabled by Unicef at a seminar in Nyeri yesterday, read in part: \"Recent statistics indicate that among girls aged 15-19 attending ante-natal clinics, 22 per cent are HIV-positive while only six per cent of boys are so affected.\nThe report adds that due to the scourge, life expectancy for Kenyans is expected to reduce to 53-\n51 years by the 2005. It is currently 54.7, down from 64.5 years in 1995.\nThere are indications that young people are being exposed to the virus at extremely early stages. Titled \"Fighting the war against HIV/Aids in Kenya - An\nemergency plan of action\" the report is compiled by Unicef and the Kenya Government.\nThe main modes of transmission are identified as heterosexual contact, mother-to-child and blood transfusion. The report further says that a total of 420,000 Aids cases were reported to the Ministry of Health by the end of last month.\nThis, however, was a tip of the iceberg. An estimated 1.5 million Kenyans are living with HIV infection, 90,000 of whom are children, according to the report.\nResults of protective surveillance for 1997 show that over 20 per cent of expectant mothers in Kisumu, Nakuru, Busia and Thika are HIV-positive The report says that overall in Kenya, prevalence has risen from 3.1 per cent in 1990 to nine per cent in 1997, with the urban average currently at 12-13 per cent and the rural eight to nine per cent.\nThis does not mean, however, that the urban population is more affected than the rural.\nThe report says, \"Although the percentage in rural areas may appear low, in absolute numbers the rural population infected is higher since the majority of Kenyans are located there.\"\nThe report also quotes from research carried out by the African Medical Research Foundation on adolescent sexual behavior along the Trans-Africa Highway, which found that 30 to 50 per cent of boys and girls respectively had a sexually transmitted disease."}
