{"text": "Facts on condoms distorted\nI am writing in response to Dr Stephen K.\nKaranja's letter entitled: \"Public needs facts\non condoms\" (DN Dee 7). Dr Karanja's letter\nhad some factual errors and some major distortions\nof the data. These inaccuracies and\ndistortions should be corrected so that the\nreaders of the Nation can have accurate information\non the true potential of condoms to\nprotect reproductive health.\nCondom facts: Consistent and correct use is\nthe key\nI applaud the Government of Kenya and the\nDaily Nation for raising awareness regarding\ncondoms and their role in the battle against\nHIV/Aids. This public discussion is urgently\nneeded but it should be based on facts. Dr\nKaranja's letter distorts many of the issues\nregarding the use and effectiveness of condoms.\nPlease allow me to clarify some of\nthese issues for your readers.\nAll contraceptives, including condoms,\nhave a failure rate. The most widely accepted\npregnancy rate for the male latex condom is\nactually between 2 to 14 per 100 women over\n12 months of use. Behavioural factors explain\n. the differences in these two rates. When condoms\nare used consistently and correctly, a\npregnancy rate closer to the low end of the\nrange can be achieved. When condoms are\nused inconsistently or incorrectly, a pregnancy rate closer to the upper end of the range can\nbe expected. Motivated users are the key issue\nnot the device.\nWhile no one would assert that condoms\nprovide 100% protection against HIV or other\nSTDs, they provide the best protection available\nfor those who are sexually active. Study\nafter study shows this. Perhaps the most compelling\nevidence in the published literature\ncomes from \"discordant couples\" studies.\nThese studies follow couples in which one\npartner is infected with HIV while the other is\nun-infected. Therefore, every act of intercourse\ncarries a risk of transmission. These\n\"discordant couples\" are encouraged to\nabstain from intercourse, or to use condoms.\nScientists measure the rate of infection over\ntime.\nThese studies show that consistent and correct\nuse of condoms prevents the transmission\nof HIV in 98 - 99% of the un-infected partners.\nThe issue of holes in condoms raised by Dr\nKaranja should also be clarified. Obviously,\nas with any product, imperfections do occur or\ncan be introduce:! by the user. Small holes\nmight appear that could theoretically allow the\npassage of a pathogen. Fortunately, this theory\nis supported by neither laboratory nor epidemiological data. Laboratory tests show\nthat intact condoms form a nearly impermeable\nbarrier to spermatozoa and STD pathogens.\nEven when leakage occurs, scientists\nestimate that condom use would decrease\nexposure to HIV 10,000 times.\nWith regards to slippage and breakage,\nagain this type of problem does occur among\na small minority of users but very infrequently.\nAn aggressive public health communication\ncampaign should instruct all Kenyans on\nthe proper use and disposal of condoms.\nThe current discussion about condom use is\nimportant for Kenya. But let the scientific evidence\nguide the debate. Every reputable public\nhealth agency in the world, including the\nWorld Health Organisation, supports the central\nrole that condoms can play in an\nHIV/Aids prevention programme. Condoms\nare not a \"bullet proof' barrier against\nunwanted pregnancy or STD infection. The\nonly way to achieve 100 % protection from\nHIV is through abstinence or life long mutual\nmonogamy. For the rest of us, condoms provide\nexcellent protection.\nDr Michael Welsh,\nRegional Director,\nFamily Health International\nNairobi.\nIt's good we're talking openly\nIn a certain sense, I am personally\ndelighted that the condom is\ngetting a real airing instead of\nthe furtive manner in which the\nwhole business has been in the\npast. Considering the avalanche\nof condoms which now inundate\nthe country we need to talk\nabout it.\nFor example, Mr Jackson\nKalweo while Minister of Health\nreceived a huge consignment of\ncondoms as a donation during\nthe bomb blast at the US\nEmbassy in 1998 - with the\nassumption, I suppose that even\nduring that national tragedy\nwhen our hearts were heavy and\nour eyes filled with tears, we\nwere still engaging in frenzied\nsexual activity. It is also true that\nmany in the West view Africans\nas people incapable of self control\nsexually or otherwise. The\nsolution for such depravity is no\ndoubt clear at all!\nAs a person who has worked\nfor many years with children\ndying of Aids, I am aware of the tragedy\nin our midst. Many of\nthe children in our Hospice had\nyoung professional parents with\ngreat hopes which turned to\nashes as one parent, then the\nother died, soon to be followed\nby the children. It is hard to\napportion blame to a little child.\nTo use or not to use the condom,\nthat is the question. The\nquestion in fact is not what the\nPresident says or what the bishops\nsay. It is a question of what\nkind of risks one wishes to take\nwith one's life, the life of one's\nspouse or one's children. President\nMoi and mainstream media\ninsist that you can entrust your life to a piece of latex rubber that\nsheaths the male organ partially.\nThe bishops say abstain and obey\nthe commands of your God. And\nwhat does common sense say? Is\na few minutes of illicit pleasure\nworth the risk of my life, the life\nof my spouse or of my children\nborn and unborn?\nAgain as the condom debate\nrages on, we forget a few basic\nthings:-\nQ Aids is a disease fuelled by\npoverty - and 50 per cent of Kenyans\nnow live below the poverty\nline. Nothing much is being done\nto alleviate the miserable condition\nof our jobless youth who\nengage in careless sex out of\nsheer desperation. The government\nnow has a wonderful\nanswer. Give them condoms.\nQ I would believe more in the\naltruistic intentions of donors if\nthey gave us not only condoms,\nbut equally huge consignments of\nthe triple therapy drug regime so\nthat the lives of those infected can\nbe lengthened and made more\nbearable.\nQ It was extremely hazardous to\nimport wholesale solutions from\nthe West - where HIV/Aids\nremains a disease of recognisable\ngroups such as homosexuals and\nintravenous drug users. In Africa\nHIV/Aids is everybody's disease.\nThis boils down to the fact that\nbetween my 16-year-old daughter\nand that wealthy gentleman\nwhose semen is teeming with\nviruses - there is only a thin barrier\nmade of latex rubber. The\nwhole business makes me\nshudder. Dr Isabella Mawere,\nNairobi"}
