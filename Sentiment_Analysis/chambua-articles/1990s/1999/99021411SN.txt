The United\nNations General Assembly will vote on\nthe program in June.\nThe delegates compiled a list of recommendations\non how to improve the program\nand called for better funding, action that\ntook place without the bitter political and\nreligious wrangling that marked negotiations\nat the conference five years ago.\nWhile applauding the conference's\n.achievement, Dr Nafis Sadik, executive director\nof the United Nations Population\nFund <UNFPAJ, said that \"this is not just a\npaper, these words represent real policy\nchange. It will ensure that developing countries\nare making a serious effort to put the\nCairo plan into action.\"\nForum delegates highlighted unsafe abortion\nas a \"major public health concern,\" and\nsaid emergency contraception - meaning\nmorning-after and abortion pills - should\nbe made available to women to prevent unwanted\npregnancies.\nThe forum did not recommend changing a\nCairo program principle that in countries\nwhere abortion is legal, it should be safe and\naccessible.
