{"text": "Why do some men and women have multiple partners?\nThis section seeks to explain the behaviour of\nmen and women who have many sexual partners\nand is as a result of Andrew's earlier\nquestion. Some children have a parent (or\nboth) who has other partners outside marriage\nand this can cause a lot of trauma in a\nfamily that was otherwise close .\nThe cause of this behaviour can\neither be psychological or spiritual. .\nWhen it is psycholocgical, it can be \nas a result of ones past experiences \nthat were very painful. For example, \nsexual abuse (incest or rape), or a parent who had many partners and this caused the family to suffer. The self esteem of a child in such a situation is affected and the child may grow up feeling unworthy and unloved. As the child grows up, he or she can become love 'thirsty' or love 'hungry' and form as many relationships as he/she can in search of love. \nThey also change partners very often because they can't seem to find what they are looking for. Even if they do find a person who loves them, they don't believe that anyone can love them, they have no self-esteem remember, it was damaged during childhood. This person will also try to give meaning to their lives by looking outside themselves (in sexual partners) and not within. Eventually it becomes very difficult for them to be in a stable relationship, like in a marriage.\nWhen a child grows up in a home where\none parent is unfaithful, it can affect them psychologically\nwhen they grow up and they may\nnever trust anyone. They will be suspicious of\nanyone who tries to get close to them and\nthey may feel repulsed by close relationships\nand avoid being in any boy-girl relationship.\nHowever, not all people who have been\nsexually abused or come from homes where\none parent is unfaithful will have mutiple partners.\nWe are all different and we deal with\nproblems differently. The most important thing\nis to acknowledge that parents can be wrong\nand they are responsible for any mistakes they\nmake. We must also learn from their mistakes\nand strive to give our own children better\nlives by not repeating the mistakes our parents\nmade when bringing us up.\nSo, just because one's parent is unfaithful,\nit does not mean that the children are automatically\ngoing to be unfaithful or to refuse to\nmarry. We need to understand that God has\ngiven each of us a mind so that we can\nchoose our actions and be aware of the consequences.\nWith teenagers, lack of self-esteem, can\ncause one to have multiple partners. One may\nnot be happy with his/her physical looks or\nmay feel terrible about his/her ability to make\nand keep friends or feels bad that he/she is\nalways failing in class and is not appreciated by\nthe people who matter in his or her life.\nHaving multiple partners is their negative way\nof handling stress or the feeling of being\nunloved.\nWhen some girls lose their virginity\nbefore marriage, they may feel unlovable\nbecause they think that they have lost something\n(a part of themselves) therefore others\nwon't love them any more. So they may have\nmultiple sexual partners as a way of boosting their self-esteem, so they can feel good about\nthemselves.\nIt is ironical that in trying to 'look for\nlove' people with multiple partners end up\ndestroying those who really love them - their\nfamilies.\nSo being a casanova or being promiscuous\nwhen one is either a teenager or an adult is\nmost of the times, a symptom of an underlying\nor deeper problem. The person usually does\nnot see his behaviour as a sin. There is a spiritual\nvoid or emptiness within them and they\nmay need the help of a qualified counsellor to\nhelp him or her, identify the problem.\nAll those who have multiple partners or\nare unfaithful need to understand that he/she\nmatters. He/she is fearfully and wonderfully\nmade by God and does not have to do anything\nto be called 'worthy'.\nTo feel worthy, one needs to concentrate\non his/her strengths and work on them and\nthis will build their self image. Having multiple\npartners can have serious consequences\namong them, pregnancies, sexually transmitted\ndiseases (STD's), the most deadly being HIV\nvirus which has no cure, broken homes or\nrelationships.\nAdmitting that there is an underlying\nproblem to ones promiscuous behaviour is\nthe first step to solving the problem.
