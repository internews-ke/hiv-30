{"text": "Aids vaccine trials yet to start\nI refer to three letters (DN, Feb 1), under the\ntitle: \"Aids trials raise vital queries\". The letters\nwritten by three Kenyans residing abroad,\ninsinuate that, I, as the Director of Medical\nServices, have allowed \"untested\" HIV vaccine\ntrials to be conducted on Kenyans in exchange\nfor \"international recognition\".\nThe issues raised were based on a misleading\nassumption that clinical trials are already\nunderway. No such trials are going on.\nWhat happened was a workshop of scientists\nto explore ways and means of fighting\nHIV/Aids using the leads provided by a group\nof prostitutes in Nairobi who have proved resistant\nto HIV. The exchange of experiences\nbetween the researchers will hopefully lead to\nthe design of a vaccine.\nEven if such a vaccine is finally designed, it\nwill have to be tested by Oxford University,\nthe collaborating institution in the study, before\nit is tried in any other part of the world.\nThe protocol of carrying out a clinical trial\nensures that people are not subjected to dangerous\nexperiments that have no proven scientific\nmerits.\nAnybody wishing to carry out trials in\nKenya applies to the Office of the President,\nwhich evaluates the study before forwarding\nsuch a proposal to the technical organising\ncommittee for thorough scrutiny. The Kenya\nNational Council of Sciences deals with such\nIssues.\nKenyatta National Hospital and the University of Nairobi have ethical committees which\nevaluate the safety of such trials. Even after approval\nis given, the institutions must seek the\nconsent of those to participate in a clinical trial.\nThe authorisation of clinical trials is so thorough\nthat the envisioned HIV vaccine trials\nmay not even take place in Kenya if the proposal\nis found wanting. So the question of using\nAfricans as guinea pigs does not arise.\nAs to why anti-retroviral therapies are not\navailable cheaply to Kenyans, the researchers\nare not in any way linked to the pharmaceutical\nfirms which make them. These are commercial\nenterprises which sell their products at a profit.\nHowever, even these therapies are not a cure\nfor Aids.\nThe Ministry of Health is emphasising safe\nsex; effective treatment of STDs, appropriate\nhealth education, prevention of vertical transmission\nof HIV and safe blood transfusion as a\nmeans to stem the spread of HIV/Aids.\nIt is gratifying, however, to note that UNAids\nis negotiating with makers of anti-viral\ntherapies to make these drugs available\ncheaply \nProf Julis Meme,\nDirector of Medical Services,\nNairobi.\nWith the good news that our women may have\ncome to the rescue of humankind in the fight against HIV/Aids, what reward do 'the government,\nresearchers and pharmaceutical firms\nhave for them Had these Majengo slums women been an\noil well, gold mine or even lumber, the government\nwould have protected them. I would, if I\nwere in charge. Why? These women's bodies\nhave been able to develop a biological weapon\nagainst one of the most dreaded pandemics in\nhistory. They need protection.\nSecondly, the government should declare\nthem a \"natural national asset\" just as we\nhave declared our wild animals.\nWe should make sure that this resource is\nnot exploited to enrich other people and\nnations as has happened to our wildlife, beaches,\nsoda ash, gold and land! And more.\nIf we can talk about the patenting of intellectual\nrights; then I see no reason why those\nwomen's biological rights shoudn't be patented?\nThe government should reach an accord\nwith drug companies to pay the women and the\nstate a fee whenever they use their natural immune\n\"fluid\" against the Aids virus. It should\nbe similar to what Coca Cola has done to protect\nits formula.\nUnless this happens, only a few Kenyans\nand the pharmaceutical conglomerates may\nend up benefiting, leaving the women and their\noffspring stuck in prostitution forever.\nProf Katama Mkangi,.\nWisconsin, US."}
