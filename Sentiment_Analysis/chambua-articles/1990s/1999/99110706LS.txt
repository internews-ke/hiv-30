{"text": "Women's rights: long way off\nWhen the Taleban militia took over\npower from the Mujaheddin in\nAfghanistan on September 27,\n1996, women lost their liberty and\ntheir .livelihoods. Prior to this, women had relative\nfreedom to work, dress, drive or appear in\npublic.\nSince then, women have been forced to wear\nburqua (a shroud with a mesh over the eyes that\ncovers them from head to foot and was last\ncompulsory in 1959 even though the Quran\norders only that women be veiled) and live separate\nfrom men.\nWomen have been beaten and stoned to death\nin public. Two women were recently stoned to\ndeath - one for exposing her arm while driving\nand the other, for trying to leave the country\nwith a man who was not her relative.\nAccording to media reports and Reader's\nDigest, the Taleban (meaning scholars or students)\nwho are right-wing fundamentalist Muslims\nhave ensured that women do not work, or\ngo out in public without a male relative. ,\nHomes where a woman is present must have\ntheir windows painted so that they are never\nseen - they live in fear of their lives for the\nslightest \"misbehaviour\". Schools and colleges\nthem out, while professional women such as\nprofessors, translators, doctors, lawyers, artists\nand writers must stay at home.\nThe ban on women's employment has left\nthem without incomes and those without male\nrelatives have resorted to begging in the streets.\nThey include teachers and university lecturers\nwith PhDs. This has resulted in alarming levels\nof depression among the women.\nRelief workers say that since many of them\ncannot find proper medication or treatment, suicide rates are in thousands - the most common\nmethod is taking caustic soda, the most easily\navailable poison but one of the slowest and most\npainful ways to die. The UN is yet to take\naction..\nIn Britain, women working in banks complain\nof male dominance. Men earn more. Employers\ndiscriminate against women and have little sympathy\nfor working mothers, a Reuter's survey\nsaid last May. Women have to look outside their\ncurrent employer if they want to move up the\nladder.\nDuring the Women's Day celebrations in\nSouth Africa last August, President Thabo\nMbeki called for an end to violence against\nwomen. South Africa has the highest incidence\nof rape in the world with a female being raped\non average every 25 seconds. \n. An additional 14,000 girls under 18\nare raped often by men who believe having sex\nwith a virgin will cure HIV infections.\nMr Mbeki promised that his government would\nspeed up the establishment of one-stop help centres\nfor abused women and children and increase\nAids-related work to improve support for Aids\nvictims and orphans. '\nIn Japan, after a controversial nine-year deliberation\nby Japan's Ministry of Health and Welfare in Tokyo, the birth control pill has been\napproved. The delay angered many women's\ngroups, particularly when Viagra, the impotence\nremedy for men went on sale earlier this year\njust six months after being submitted for\napproval. Before giving their okay to the pill,\nofficials argued it carried negative side-effects\nand would destroy the nation's morals.\nIn Kenya, many problems facing women are\nnow being addressed much more often albeit\nslowly. Some of these are gender equality, economic\nempowerment, an end to genital mutilation\nand domestic violence, inclusion of women\nin district and provincial security committees,\ngender equality in institutions of learning right\nfrom primary. education. It is also hoped that\nmany laws that discriminate against women will\nbe reviewed..\nRecently, Elina Muthoni, a mother of four\nwas sentenced to seven years in prison for selling\nthe family cow to feed her children. Only the\nintervention of the International Federation of\nWomen Lawyers (Fida) rescued her. The law\nconcerning animal-related. offences is more\nharsh than the one on rapists or domestic violence\noffenders.\nAlthough the Constitution forbids discrimination\nagainst women and Kenya ratified the\nUnited Nations Convention on the Elimination\nof All Forms of Discrimination against women\nin 1984, such bias continues unabated.\nAccording to the Kenya National Human\nDevelopment Report, J 999, violence against\nwomen takes many forms and is now recognised\nas a major impediment to women's full participation\nin society. Whatever form it takes wife battery, rape and defilement, sexual harassment,\nemotional and economic deprivation,\nfemale genital mutilation, inhedance laws (both\nparental and matrimonial) wife inheritance,' and\nsexual slavery have been acknowledged as a\ndevelopment issue.\nIn Kenya, as in many other parts of the world,\nviolence against women is seen as a private\nmatter between individuals and not a public or\nhuman rights issue and that is why it is not\ntaken seriously.\nIt is because of the above anomalies that\nwomen in Kenya are' excited by recent developments\nin Parliament. On May 12, Parliament\npassed a Motion urging the government to\nestablish-a gender equality commission to promote\nrespect for women and equality. The\nMotion was pegged on recommendations of the\nBeijing Declaration and the Platform for Action\nand was moved by NDP leader Raila Odinga. In April, Cabinet Minister Marsden Madoka\nurged parents to educate girls as women\nhave a potential to make a major contribution\nto the country's economic\ndevelopment.\nA Forum for African Women Educationists\n(Fawe) report says that about 30 million girls in\nsub-Saharan Africa have no access to basic education.\nSupporting' the Motion, Nominated MP\nAnyang' Nyong'o said gender equality efforts\nshould be included in the national poverty eradication\nplans because the two were interlinked,\nwhile NDP Nominated MP Mariam Matano\nasked the government to bring back the Affiliation\nAct to ensure that men were held responsible\nfor the upbringing of children they sired. October 6 marked yet another milestone for\nKenyan women'. A Motion calling for urgent\nmeasures to enhance the role of women in\nnational development was passed to the delight\nof many women and male supporters in Kenya.\nThe Motion had, been brought to Parliament on\nJuly 28 by Dagoretti MP Beth Mugo.\n\"Being a (Kenyan) woman means recognising\n.that you are part of a relay in which you have\nreceived a baton from other women. You are\nexpected to keep focused on the race, to ensure\nthat you hand the baton to the next person without\ntripping her\", says Dr Wanjiku Kabira, a\nNairobi University lecturer. This is one of the\nways women in. Kenya and around the world\nwill fight against discrimination towards women.\nIn Afghanistan, Shafika Habibi, 54, a wellknown\njournalist; also confined to her house, is\nworking together with other women to fight for\ntheir rights as w\u00a21Ias run underground schools\nfor girls. Most of her friends have fled the country\nbut she hasn't because, \"I want to find a way\nto provide a future for young girls. If this situation\ngoes on, we will lose a whole generation.\"\nThe Taleban have created a population of\nwomen more aware of their rights than ever\nbefore.\nKenyan women and sympathisers are anxiously\nawaiting the recommendations of the task\nforce that was instituted in 1993, the May 12\nand October 6 Motions in Parliament with a\nhope that in the new millennium, women might\nfinally become equal partners in the development\nof this nation.\nElina Muthoni: Jailed for seven years .for selling the family\ncow to feed her children.\nAn Mghanistani woman dressed in burqua.
