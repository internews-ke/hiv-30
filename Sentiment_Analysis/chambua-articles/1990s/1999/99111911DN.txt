{"text": "Aids orphans compound\nS. Africa's revival plan\nBy SHELLEE GEDULD,\nCAPE TOWN, Friday\nUp to a million South African\nchildren face a grim future as\nthe HIV/Aids pandemic\norphans them and adds further\nto the burdens on the country\nas it struggles to rebuild itself\nfrom the ashes of apartheid.\n\"It is a really crucial thing,\"\nWorld Health Organisation\ncare worker Elizabeth\nChidonza told Reuters. \"It is\ngoing to be sad if nothing is\ndone for these children. Even\nif they test negative their lives\nwill be ruined.\"\nShe estimated that within five\nyears one million South African\nchildren would be\norphaned by Acquired\nImmune Deficiency\nSyndrome.\nIn a country where the taboo\nof Aids and its precursor the\nHuman Immunodeficiency\nVirus (HIV) is so great that\npeople carrying the disease\nfear being ostracised or worse\nby their community, the children\nare the forgotten victims.\nNazareth House, nestling at\nthe foot of Cape Town's landmark\nTable Mountain, is a\nrare exception to this rule.\n\"We have 40 children here.\nThirty-five are HIV positive\nand the other five are either\nDowns Syndrome and or suffer\nfrom Cerebral Palsy, but in\nthe future we will only accept\nchildren who are HIV positive,\"\nsocial worker Jayne\nPayne told Reuters . \"Many of the children we have\nhere at Nazareth House have been\nabandoned or severely beaten,\"\nshe added.\nPayne said there has been a significant\nincrease in the number of\nchildren who are born HIV\npositive.\n\"Within the last five years we\nhave seen an increase in the number of babies orphaned due to\nAids.\nBefore, we would get an application\nabout once a month. Now we\nget about five,\" she said.\nThe children living in the house\nlook healthy and carefree.\nThey run around on the huge\nlawns in front of their home and\nplay on the jungle gym like other children their age, but their lives\nare different. Many are not\nexpected to reach their fifth\nbirthday.\n\"If these children did not come\nhere to Nazareth House, they\nwould not live for more than\ntwo, three years,\" Payne said.\nBut here we give them so much\nlove and attention, and we give\nthem the stimulation they need,\nso many of them live to the age\nof five, sometimes six,\" she\nadded.\nEach child gets individual\nattention, with one care worker\nallocated to every three children.\nThe children are never left\nalone.\nThe older children at Nazareth\nHouse attend play school, which\nis on the premises and has a\nqualified pre-school teacher\nwho volunteers three days a\nweek.\nThe classroom is bright and full\nof pictures the children drew or\npainted. Payne said she wanted\nto see mothers being given medication\nto stop the transmission\nof Aids from mother to baby.\nA UN report says mother-to child\ntransmissions can be\nreduced by providing HIV positive\nwomen with antiretroviral\ndrugs and alternatives to\nbreast milk.\nHIV first surfaced in the late\n1970s.\nAt the end of 1998 3.2 million\nSouth Africans in a population\nof around 40 million had tested\nHIV positive.
