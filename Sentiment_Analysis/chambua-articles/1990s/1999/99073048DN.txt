{"text": "July 30, 1999\nClergyman\u2019s stand on AIDS and a right\u2028\nof marriage .\n\nBy WiLLIAM ORENDE\u2028\nAs Aids continues to claim the\u2028\neconomically productive members of the Kenyan society, third\u2028\nparties are increasingly getting\u2028\nconcerned to ensure that marriages are not solemnised to expose either of the betrothed couples to Hl V/Aids virus.\u2028\nAt the base of their thoughts lie\u2028\npertinent and sensitive questions.\u2028\nIs it right for those who are HIV\u2028\npositive to marry? Is it fair to wed\u2028\ncouples one of whom is HIV positive? Would you allow a relative\u2028\nto wed a person whose HIV status\u2028\ns shrouded in mystery in a world\u2028\nrife with moral) lapse\u2019\u2019 And if you\u2028\nwere a pastor would you preside\u2028\nover the wedding of a couple who\u2028\nare HIV positive?\u2028\nWhen the Provost of the \u2028\nBay Cathedral of the Anglican\u2028\nChurch, the Rev Simon Onyango\u2028\nsaid at an Aids awareness rally in\u2028\nHoma Bay that the church would\u2028\nnot solemnise marriages unless\u2028\nthe betrothed couples have medical proof of being free of HIV/Aids virus, he brought a new angle to an issue that has become the\u2028\nconcern of many.\u2028\nThe church cannot preside over\u2028\nshort lived marriages only to be\u2028\ncalled upon to perform burial rites\u2028\nwhen the couples die after only a\u2028\nfew years in the marriage union.\u2028\nThe move, the provost contended, was (o protect the institution of\u2028\nmarriage from the ravages of\u2028\nAids.,\u2028\nThe Rev Onyango\u2019s remarks\u2028\nhave since earned him both\u2028\nfriends and foes alike.\u2028\nThe head of the Anglican\u2028\nChurch of Kenya Dr David Gitan\u2028\ncriticised the Homa Bay cleric for\u2028\nmaking a policy statement which\u2028\ncould only be pronounced by the\u2028\nsynod, the highest decision making origin of the church.\u2028\n\u201cNo such decision has been\u2028\nmade,\u201d Dr Gitan told a local\u2028\nmagazine.\u2028\nDr Gitan however said the\u2028\nchurch was encouraging couples\u2028\nintending to marry to know their\u2028\nHIV status before wedding.\u2028\n\u201cThe purpose of publishing\u2028\nbanns of marriage in church is to\u2028\nallow people to show any just\u2028\ncourse, impediment (including\u2028\nAids) why they may not be law\u2028\nfully married,\u201d said the Rev\u2028\nOnyango.\u2028\n\u201cShould someone reveal that\u2028\none of the engaged couples is HIV\u2028\npositive. I will stop the solemnisation of that -marriage. The onus\u2028\nwill be with the church and the\u2028\nclaimant to prove that the allegation is not born out of malice. The\u2028\nclaimant should be made to pay or\u2028\ndeposit enough security to meet\u2028\nthe cost of the spoilt wedding,\u201d the\u2028\nclergyman said.\u2028\nAccording to the Rev Onyango,\u2028\nthe three functions of marriage\u2028\nwhich include procreation, sex\u2028\nand companionship are in jeopardy with the onset of Aids.\u2028\nadds that HIV positive\u2028\npeople should be advised to avoid\u2028\nsex to minimise the risk of re-infection while companionship can\u2028\nbe obtained even from a mother,\u2028\nsister, brother, the church and relatives, not necessarily in\u2028\nmarriage.\u2028\nA cross section of people interviewed, received the Rev Onyango\u2019s remarks with mixed reaction\u2028\nFather Lucas Onyango, the\u2028\npriest in-charge of St Paul\u2019s Parish church, said the church had\u2028\ndiscussed the issue of wedding\ncouples who have terminal illness\u2028\n(including Aids) at very high\u2028\nlevel\u201d.\u2028\nHe said the Vatican had recommended against wedding of the\u2028\nsickly as far back as 1965.\u2028\nHoma Bay Medical Officer of\u2028\nHealth Hebson Otuoch said the\u2028\nmove would infringe on individual rights.\u2028\nOthers interviewed said barring\u2028\nHIV positive people from marry-\u2028\n\u00a1ng would criminalise carriers of\u2028\nthe virus. They dismissed it as an\u2028\nattempt by the church to distance\u2028\nthemselves from the sick whom\u2028\nthey are supposed to care for.\u2028\nBut a philanthropist Mrs Kezia\u2028\nOnyango says, \u201cThe fact that we\u2028\nmust show love and care to the\u2028\nsick doesn\u2019t mean you do not\u2028\nscreen your mouth when one\u2028\ncoughs and sneezes around you.\u2028\nWe must protect ourselves.\u201d\u2028\nMrs Teddy Olang\u2019 said the only\u2028\njustification for such action would\u2028\nbe if one of the parties had not revealed the result of the HIV test.\u2028\n\u201cAre they likely to reveal it to the\u2028\nchurch?\u201d she asked.\u2028\n\u201cSome countries in the west\u2028\nhave numerous marriages between HIV positive people but societies in the developing world\u2028\nneed to be first sensitised against\u2028\nstigmatisation of people with Aids\u2028\nbefore the infected can own up\u2028\nand declare their HIV status,\u201d says\u2028\nDison Gogi.\u2028\nAnother Anglican priest in Migori the Rev Pamela Omotlo said\u2028\nweddings between HIV positive\u2028\npeople had been discussed by the\u2028\nchurch at \u201cvery high levels\u201d. She\u2028\nhowever remained sceptical about\u2028\nthe authenticity of certificates to\u2028\nbe issued by doctors.\u2028\n\u201cEighty per cent of Christians\u2028\ncan cheat on us (clergy),\u201d she\u2028\nsaid, but added that attempts must\u2028\nbe made to protect people from\u2028\ncontracting Aids through careless\u2028\nsolemnisation of marriages.\u201d\u2028\nHoma Bay DC Aggrey Mudinyu, Resident Magistrate Helen\u2028\nOpariga and the secretary of\u2028\nSouthern Nyanza branch of the\u2028\nLaw Society of Kenya, G. S.\u2028\nOkoth are of the opinion that en\u2028\ngaged couples should declare\u2028\ntheir HIV status before they are\u2028\nmarried.\u2028\n\u201cIf doctors can be truthful in the\u2028\nissuance of certificates showing\u2028\nthe HIV status, great strides\u2028\nwould be achieved in the fight\u2028\nagainst the disease,\u201d said Mrs\u2028\nOpanga.\u2028\nThe results of such tests, ac-.\u2028\ncording to Mrs Opanga, should be\u2028\nobtained by the church for counselling purposes. .\u2028\nBut two clinical officers at the\u2028\ndistrict hospital, Dan Amayo and\u2028\nJoshua Odhiambo said Aids patients should be allowed to marry\u2028\nas a therapeutic means of curbing\u2028\nthe spread of Aids.\u2028\n\u201cThe HIV positive people\u2028\nshould marry since they are nor\u2028\nmal human beings with sexual\u2028\nurges. If they do not many, they\u2028\nwill spread the virus to other un\u2028\nsuspecting people,\u201d said Mr\u2028\nAmayo.\u2028\nThe co-ordinator of Futures\u2028\nGroup International, Richard\u2028\nOdindo sees blackmail in the\u2028\nmove to bar Aids sufferers from\u2028\nmarriage.\u2028\n\u201cThe cleric should target the\u2028\nyouth as early as Sunday school-\u2028\ngoing ages without necessarily\u2028\nwailing o blackmail them at the\u2028\npulpit during their wedding ceremonies.\u201d said Mr Odindo."}
