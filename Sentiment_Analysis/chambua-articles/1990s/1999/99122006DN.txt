{"text": "Heed Unicef study in anti-Aids drive\nWith the impact of HIV/Aids threatening virtually every\nsector of our economy, its toll on education is particularly\nfrightening for it is on the sector that the hopes of the\ncountry's future are hinged.\nThe most vulnerable class of people are our young ones\nwho are currently in school. In their innocence and drive to\ndiscover their identities and understand their bodies, our\nchildren become easy prey especially at the mercy of\ngrown-up sexual perverts ... ' .\nParadoxically, any campaign to enlighten the population'\non the dangers of irresponsible sex would be most successful\nin schools since it would just be integrated in the curriculum\nand hammered to the students during their schooling\nlives, unlike campaigns targeted at folks in the diversity .of\ntheir lives ..\nA study by Unicef, details of which appear in the Black-'\nboard section of this paper, highlights the potential dangers\nthat nations face if a concerted effort to take the campaign\nagainst Aids to schools is not embarked on urgently.\nThe study done in the Eastern, Central and South Africa,\nsays that many schools are likely to close due to lack of\nstudents - fewer children are being born because of early\ndeaths of one or both parents. '\nThe research cites Kenya's Nyanza province as one region\nwhere the death rate of teachers due to Aids is alarming. On\naverage, the report says, between 20-30 teachers die every\nmonth in the province 'due to HIV/Aids.\nIf teachers die at such a rate and given that the government\nno longer employs new ones, then the pupil/teacher ratio is\nbound to rise affecting the quality of education.\nStatistics indicate that more than 20 per cent of all students\nin the country are HIV positive.\nThe way forward, the study. says, is to introduce  special\nprogrammes in schools. to equip learners With special skills\nthat would enable them 'to prevent the spread of the disease and at the same time cope with the trauma it brings to families ..\nThe Ministry of Education ought to incorporate .a subject\non the HIV/Aids into the curricula in all the schooling levels\nin order to avert the dangers posed and help inculcate in our\nchildren, skills that enable them to control their sexual\nbehaviour. The introduction of life skills programmes in\nour schools cannot wait until the new system of education is\nimplemented in 2001. The time to introduce the subjects is\nnow."}
