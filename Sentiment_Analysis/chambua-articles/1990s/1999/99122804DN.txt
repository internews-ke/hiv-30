{"text": "Step up effort to curb Aids menace\nThe involvement by Kenyan researchers in the development\nof a Sh300 million HIVI Aids trial vaccine\u2019s no doubt a great\ncontribution to the global efforts to find an answer to this rapidly\nspreading scourge. Since the first case was reported in\nKenya over a decade ago, Aids has already claimed some\n200,000 lives.\nThe latest statistics indicate that 1.5 million people are today\ncarrying the virus and it's feared that by the turn of the\ncentury, one million people will have succumbed to Aids unless\nserious efforts are made to reverse the trend. It is for this\nreason that the government and NGOs must\u00b7 step up the campaign\nagainst Aids.\nEven as the HIV trials - the Oxford-Nairobi International\nAids Vaccine Initiative project - continue, it must be made\nclear to all that there is no cure for Aids. The Kenyan researchers\nand their foreign collaborators have established that\nsome prostitutes have been exposed to the virus that cause\nAids since 1985, but have failed to contract it.\nThis is a significant scientific observation that could help to\nunravel the Aids mystery. However, it is just a study whose\n, findings are not exhaustive. The researchers are not in any\nway suggesting that the solution to this menace has now been\nfound and people should throw caution to the wind.\nIt is for this reason that the team working on the Aids trial\nvaccine has been encouraging prostitutes to use condoms during\nsexual intercourse. This is the surest way to protect themselves\nagainst the scourge. This is a message others who have\nbeen indulging in unsafe sex must heed for their own good.\nThere are numerous trials going on all over the world in a\nbid to find an Aids cure. But unfortunately, none of these have\nyielded a cure, hence the need for prevention against the\nAids-causing virus.\nThe mounting Aids cases are a burden for families, employers,\ncommunities and the health care system. The target\ngroup comprises mainly people in the most active and productive\nperiods in' 'their lives. They will in most cases be\nyoung parents, hence the increasing number of Aids orphans\n- now estimated at 600,000 in the country.\nThough we welcome the researchers' encouraging initiative,\nthe greater effort must go into the anti-Aids awareness\ncampaign"}
