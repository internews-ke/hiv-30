{"text": "Grandmothers step in for fallen siblings\nMany called out of \u201cretirement\u201d by socio-economic impact of Aids\nAt 72 years, Ndoto Lemayian has just been recalled from \u201cretirement\u201d back to the world of diapers. She is now the \u201cmother\u201d of four siblings whose parents were claimed by Aids.\nLemayian is one of many\ngrandmothers in Kajiado who\nhave to step in for their fallen sons\nand daughters as the Aids monster\nspreads its tentacles, inflicting\npainful socio-economic impacts.\n\"This village will be wiped by\nAids unless people change their\nattitudes. Many people have died,\nyet those left behind don't seem to\nlearn their lessons,\" says Irene\nKatete, a social development officer\nin Kajiado Central.\nOlturoto is among the areas targeted\nby the Maasai Aid Awareness\nProject (MAA-P) - a grassroots\noriented project that aims at\ncreating Aids awareness in the villages.\nThe project was formed in\n1997 and operates in the Ngong\nand Central division of this vast\nRift Valley dist6ct. The project\nhas been funded! by the Catholic\nRelief Service and the Kenya\nCommunity Development Foundation\n(KCDF) an Aga Khan\nFoundation project.\nAccording to official estimates,\nthe two divisions have a combined\npopulation of 210,092. \"Our aim\nis to reach people in the villages\nand create Aids, awareness. We\naim to use peer educators to reach\n60,000 people by the end of 1999,\" says Jason ole Parantai,\nMAA-P coordinator.\nParantai feels other interventions\nhave not succeeded because\nof implementers' insensitivity to\nlocal cultural practices. \"You\ncannot impart messages on sexually\ntransmitted diseases and sexuality\nto a mixed Maasai audience.\nThis is culturally\nunacceptable,\" he says.\nMAA-P has thus resorted to using\npeer educators to address age mates\non key Aids/STD issues\nwithout inhibitions. To ensure everyone\nreceives Aids awareness\ninformation, the programme has\nassigned specific functions to\neach stratum. There are field animators\nwhose role is to mobilise\nthe community. There are also\nvolunteers interested in helping\ncurb Aids spread in their respective\nareas. Most animators are\ndrawn from community-based organisation\n(CBOs) and have been\ntrained in communication skills\nand mobilisation by MAA-P.\nEach project village has a management\nwhose membership includes\nelders, youth representatives\nand traditional birth\nattendants, women group leaders\nand people with disabilities. Since the formation of village\ncommittees, members have been\ncreating awareness on Aids in\nhomesteads and at public fora .\n\"There is no time to waste. We\ncapitalise on any opportunity to\ncreate awareness to individuals as\nwell as groups,\" says Mzee James\nKoyiet, chair, Olturoto village\ncommittee.\nMAA-P's campaigri against\nAids spread has taken a unique dimensions.\nUnlike programmes\nthat give general information,\nMAA-P is interested in each person\nwith a view of effecting behavioural\nchange. Committee members\nmake door-to-door\ncampaigns.\nThe district rates of HIV infection\nare alarming. This is partly\nblamed on Maasai cultural practices.\nIt is widely believed that the\ncommunity has liberal sexual\nbehaviour that abets Aids spread.\n\"The Maasai are always last in .\nadapting to new situations. Just\nlike we were the last to embrace\neducation and modem religion, it\nappears we will be the last to admit\nthe existence of Aids,\" philosophises\nMzee John ole Koitei, a\nretired civil servant and an animator.\nHe reckons Aids will have killed many by the time the Maasai\nrealise its presence among\nthem.\n. \"We have a tough task ahead.\nWe are dealing with people who\ndon't believe the disease exists.\nMoneyed youth in our area are the\nmost reckless,\" complains a\nyouth leader from Keekonyokie in\nNgong. Youth in the area are driven\nto death by the money they\nmake from livestock sales. Upon\nselling livestock, they indulge in\nreckless sex that exposes them to\nHIV/Aids, which they then bring\nto the villages.\nAccording to Parantai, the\nprogramme is currently formulating\nrelevant information, education\nand communication (IEC)\nmaterial for the target populations.\nThis will include T-shirts,\nkhangas, caps, pamphlets and\nposters with messages in the local\nlanguage.\nThe programme also seeks to\naddress key areas that have been\nidentified as abetting the spread of\nAids. Most are culture-related and\ninclude circumcision, teeth extraction\nand ear-piercing when\nsurgeons do not use sterilised\ntools.\nInvestigations reveal that visiting peers in some parts of the district have sex with their hosts wives, increasing chances of HIV/Aids spread. Maasai culture dictates that a host vacates his house for the night his agemate is visiting as a show of respect. The visitor and the host's wife are free to engage in sex if they so wish.\n\"Cultural practices that abet the spread of HIV/Aids and other STDs should be discarded if we are to succeed in the war against Aids,\" the national manager of the National Aids and STDs Control Programme (NASCOP), Dr Bilha Hagembe, said while addressing local leaders at a recent symposium.\nParticipants agreed that the best way to end the outmoded practice popularly known as \"wife-sharing,\" is to put up visitors' house or have additional bedrooms in existing housing structures to avoid forcing wives into tempting situations with strange men.(A IRIS Feature)\n\nOld people in Arica have assisted in looking after the\ngrandchildren but this has now become compulsory for many."}
