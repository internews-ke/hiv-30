{"text": "Fishermen losing fight against Aids\nBy PAMELA OUKO\nCultural practices, lofty but suicidal\nsexual escapades and ignorance\nhave made the Lake Victoria's\nfishing community one of\nthe most vulnerable groups to the\nAids epidemic.\n'Researchers and health authorities\nare concerned that despite\nstrong campaigns, most of the\nfishermen whose lifestyles evolve\naround the lakeshores are losing\nthe fight against the disease.\nA recent seminar held in Mbita\nand sponsored by Care-Kenya\ndiscussed in detail health problems\nin Suba and how to arrest the\nsituation.\nHeld under a new Care project\nTANG' (a Luo acronym for Take\nCare), the seminar recommended\nthat campaigns be intensified to\neducate the fishermen about the\ndangers of some cultural practices\nin relation to spread of Aids.\nAccording to the TANG' project\nmanager, Mr George Otiu Kidenda,\na socio-cultural survey\nwould be done in Suba District to\nhelp sensitise the local community\non health issues vis-avis their\ncultures.\nMr Kidenda, said the socio-cultural\nenvironment in Suba District\nacts as a vehicle in propagating\nthe increase of STI/HIV infections\nin the area and despite the information\nand awareness offered\non the menace the community is\nstill at risk of the diseases.\nIn his report, Mr Kidenda said\nthe community living in Suba District\nwere tied to practices like\nforced early marriages of girls,\nwife inheritance and hostility towards\nAids prevention devices\nlike condoms. But the biggest problem facing\nthe people of Suba is the unavailability\nof health facilities.\nThis, the seminar participants\nwere told had hampered efforts to\nprevent diseases and treat some of\nthe STIs at early stages.\nThe TANG' report said the district\nhad only one doctor who doubles\nas the District Medical Officer\nof Health against a population\nof 300,000 people.\nThe district hospital, it said\nlacked modem equipment.\nThe poor roads in the district\nhampers the transportation of\ndrugs to health centres in the interior.\nThe district hospital, which is\ntechnically a health centre does\nnot have the required facilities for\ntesting the HIV virus hence the\npatients have to travel for about 42\nkilometers to Homa-Bay District\nHospital for such services.\nHostility by some health personnel\nagainst those seeking treatment\nfor sexually transmitted infections\n(STI) were cited as a\ndrawback in the campaign against\nthe spread of the diseases.\nThe attitude has allegedly kept\naway patients.\nThe District Medical Officer of\nHealth, Dr John Opeya, said the\ngroup mostly affected by the STIs\nwere the youth and the fishermen.\nHe said the district had recorded\na drastic increase in infections\namong the two groups and that the\nsituation was set to get worse unless\nthe locals changed their lifestyles\nand attitudes.\nDr Opeya called for counseling\nof the youth and behavioural\nchange to the whole community.\n\"We are not going to stop the \nspread of the HIV if we do not change our behaviour and do away with the myth that Aids does exist and is just but taboos (Chira), he said\nThe Aids prevalence in the district, he said, stood at 3.3 per cent.\nThis data, he added was obtained from Homa-Bay Hospital which is over 50 km away. He said many more infections had not be recorded.\nThe national aids information and education officer, Mr Meshack Ndolo, who was recently on\na trip to Suba however said that\nmore fishermen were falling victims to the disease because they were always not available for\ncounselling or education.\n\"These fishermen are very difficult to meet. They go to work during the night and sleep during\nthe day,\" Mr Ndolo said.\nAccording to other seminar\nparticipants Suba is faced with a\nmassive school drop out rate with many children\" getting into fishing , commercial sex or into early\nmarriages. Child labour is also\nrampant.\nLast week, a group of fishermen\ntold the Nation that they are\nopposed to the use of condoms as\nan Aids control measure, arguing\nthat the approach had increased\nimmorality in the Lake region.\nHealth officials say other sexually\ndiseases like gonorrhea and\nsyphilis were common and that\nthese aliments were never treated\non good time, exposing sufferers to chances of contracting Aids. \nIn an interview with fishermen at one of the beaches, \u2026 they reluctantly agreed that while some of them are still ignorant about the disease, others were not interested in the fight againt the disease and believed Aids did not exist.\nLed by their beach leader Mr Samson Maende, they said even though efforts were being made in curb the spread of the disease in the area, some fishermen were not ready to use condoms. He said a few who have tried did so for only about two to three times then abandon it, thinking they were now safe.\n\"We do not want condom\nWith the condoms available men will become more randy to sleeping more women, believing that they are safe. These things have increased immorality in our community,\" a beach business woman said.\nThe beach leader said man still believed that aids was as a sort of witchcraft, popularly known in the district as Chira  and m could not therefore be transmitted through sexual intercourse .\nHe said some fishermen were also easily lured by money to buy come Jokowiny (a Luo word for\n\"professional\" wife inheritor)\nSources told the Nation that if any widows run to the beach in search of Jokowiny to perform\ncertain sex-related cultural practices. This has helped to spread  sexually transmitted diseases.\nHowever defended wife inheritance, saying if well practiced could not lead to sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nAn Aids awareness billboard: Authorities are concerned that fishermen along the shores of L Victoria\nare losing the fight against the killer disease."}
