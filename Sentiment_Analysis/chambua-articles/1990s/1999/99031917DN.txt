{"text": "Hospitals sending Aids patients home\nBy NATION Correspondent\nHospitals are sending Aids patients home where their relatives can give them emotional support, the Kiambu medical officer of health has said.\nDr J.K. Karienye said that a special unit has been set up at the district hospital to treat sexually transmitted diseases and control the spread of Aids.\nHe said the diseases were being given priority in the district where 60 people died of Aids every month. The medic urged employers to retire Aids victims with full benefits, instead of sacking them, for the sake of their children. He told a district Aids committee meeting at Nova Park Hotel in Kiambu that all prostitutes, including those living in the area but operating in Nairobi, will attend a seminar to discuss the advantages of condom use. He added that free treatment will be given for STDS. \nThe Murang'a DC, Mr Obondo Kajumbi, has asked residents to avoid careless sexual behaviour to avert contracting Aids. Mr Kajumbi said drug addiction was rampant in the district which, he noted, leads to careless sexual behaviour.\nThe administrator made the remarks at the Murang'a Tourist Lodge where he officially closed a one-day seminar organised by the district hospital. The workshop was meant to develop an Aids work plan for the area.\n\"At least 95 per cent of the people in this district are aware of this disease but most of them engage in careless sexual behaviour,\" the DC said.\nMr Kajumbi said all Aids working teams should ensure that they involve the local community so that they do not get entangled with the cultural and social behavior of people in the area.\nHowever, the DC said it was a pity that there were no proper figures for those who have tested HIV positive.\nThe Murang'a medical officer of health, Dr Peter Ndegwa, announced that Sh 1.4 million had been set aside for the Aids working team in the district."}
