{"text": "Wealthy traders in transit town corrupting youth\nMWINGI. Monday\nWealthy business people using\nMwingi in Eastern Province town\nas a transit point, are exploiting\nlocal people's poverty to lure\nthem into sex orgies. The result is\nan escalation of HIV/Aids cases in\nthe district.\nAccording to a survey carried\nout by the district public health office,\n75 per cent of lodgings in\nMwingi town are occupied in day\nlight on market days. The same\napplies to other smaller trading\ncentres in the district on market\ndays that fall on different days.\nThe district public health officer,\nMr J. M. Ndeleva, says his officers have been forced to close\nthe lodgings at day time or order\nremoval of bedding to curb the lethal\nhabit. It is common to see\nyoung women walk the streets at\nnight with wealthy livestock dealers\non the eve of market days and\non the actual market days. Bars\nand Hotels record booming business,\nwhile traders spend lavishly\nto impress their youthful catches.\nWealthy older women, too, lure\nyoung men, although they are\nmore discreet, owing to their less\naggressive nature.\nBeatrice Kalekye, a barmaid at\na local pub Kanini Kaseo says\nbusiness on market days is both\ndemanding and rewarding. For a\nmere 50 shillings, a woman can\nentertain a man for as long as\nthree hours. At peak hours, couples\nmay be seen sipping their\nbeers slowly, awaiting their turn\ninto the limited rooms that often\nfail to meet the demand on\n\"good\" days.\nAt a recent district inter-sectoral\nAids Committee (D1AC)\nmeeting, it emerged that poverty\namongst the youth was a major\ncause of their falling for the\nwealthy merchants' tricks. As\ncommittee member J. Nyaga put\nit, \"One could have a young\n\"lady\" for the night by only buying her a meal.\"\nOlder men and women use their\nfinancial clout to exploit the poor\nyouths by buying their sexual favours,\nhe adds.\nMwingi town lies along the\nhighway to the northern Kenya\ntowns of Garissa, Hola, Wajir and\nMandera. It serves as the ideal\ntransit point.\nFigures from the Ministry of\nHealth office, Mwingi, show a\nrise in HIV/Aids cases.\nAccording to the district Aids\nand sexually transmitted infections\ncontrol programme coordinator,\nMr Benjamin K. Muinde,\n573 cases were screened at the\ndistrict hospital between January\nand October 1998. Of these, 119\nwere found to be HIV positive,\nwhile another 323 cases had pulmonary\ntuberculosis (TB) (often\nlinked to HIV/Aids) that resulted\nin 21 deaths.\nThe same period saw Aids\ncases under home-care rise to 113.\nBy the end of October, 126 Aidsrelated\ndeaths were recorded, an\nincrease of34 per cent over 1997.\nWhereas there were 261 TB cases\nin 1997, 324 cases had been reported\nlast October, an increase of\nabout 50 per cent. This puts Aids\nprevalence in the district at between\nnine and 19 per cent.\nHIV prevalence in urban areas\nhas risen from 3.5 per cent in 1990\nto nine per cent presently. Whereas\nthe trend is declining in urban\nareas, it is increasing in rural\nareas.\nThe situation is not better in\nsecondary schools either. According\nto the MOH, Dr Daniel\nNguku, \"six out of every 25 students\nscreened were HIV positive.\"\nThis reflects 25 per cent\nprevalence in schools.\n\"However, this may not be a\ncorrect picture of the situation as\nonly three schools were used in\nthe sampling,\" Nguku hastens 0\nadd.\nInformation from DASCOP\nsuggests that HIV cases are rising\nfast. At the district hospital, out of\nevery 14 people tested, three,\nabout 30 per cent - were seropositive.\nThere are over 300 orphans in\nthe district a hefty rise from\n1994 when there were only seven.\nThe numbers of orphans are rising\ndaily.\nWomen are generally succumbing Aids earlier than men. Nguku attributes this to poverty, lack of food , low income and lack of recreational activities\nleads women to indulge in sexual\nactivity. Peer pressure shows older\ngirls that they ought to be working.\nIn the absence of employment,\nindulgence in commercial\nsex becomes an option, Nguku\nadds .\nBesides casual sex, alcoholism\nis a major player in the escalation\nof Aids here, as in other parts of\nKenya. There are 40 licensed bars\nwithin the township, beside other \nillegal beer dens. The rate of alcohol\nconsumption here is among\nthe highest in the country.\nMwingi falls within the arid\nand semi-arid lands. Famines,\nharsh weather conditions and generally\nharsh living keep families\napart as they go about in search of\nemployment and income. The allure\nof sex for cash usually rides\nhigh,\nA number of measures are proposed\nto contain the scourge.\nThey include billboards in the local\nKikamba language to warn\nresidents of the scourge.
