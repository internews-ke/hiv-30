{"text": "Meme clarifies I on Aids vaccine\nBy NATION Correspondent\nLocal and Oxford-based researchers are currently \"exchanging experiences\" that will hopefully lead to the designing of an HIVI Aids vaccine, the Director of Medical Services says.\nProf Julius Meme said that if such a vaccine is designed, it will have to be tested in Oxford, the collaborating institution' in the study, before being tried in any other part of the world, including\nKenya.\nThe OMS was reacting to three letters carried in Monday's Daily Nation. \"The letters, all written by Kenyans residing abroad, insinuate that I as the OMS, have allowed 'untested' HIV vaccine trials to be conducted on Kenyans in exchange for 'international recognition'\n.\n\"The issues raised by the three writers were based on the misleading assumption that clinical trials are already underway in the country,\" he said.\nProf Meme was flanked by several University of Nairobi researchers who included Prof Ndinya Achola, Dr Job Bwayo, Dr Mbori-Ngacha and Dr Ruth Nduati.\nThe researchers said Kenya and South Africa are not the only countries involved in the Aids vaccine trials others, including Uganda, India, Thailand, USA, Brazil and the UK were also involved, they added."}
