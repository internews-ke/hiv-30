{"text": "HIV in children highest in Africa\nBy NATION Correspondents\nAbout 90 per cent of children\ninfected with the Aids virus globally\nlast year were from sub-Saharan\nAfrica, a UN report says.\nAccording to the Unicef Progress\nof Nations 1999 Report, .\n530,000 of 590,000 infected children\nwere from the region.\nMost were infected prior to or\nduring birth or through breastfeeding.\nHowever, less than 1,000 infants\nwere infected that year in the\nwhole of North America and\nWestern Europe.\nIn Kenya, data from a UNAids\nand the World Health Organisation\n1997 survey showed that 66,000 children were HIV-positive.\n\"Poverty and the resulting lack\nof health services, education and\nAids treatment play a part in this\ncruel discrepancy. But perhaps the\nbiggest factor is women's lack of\ncontrol in their sexual relationships\nand, hence, over many aspects\nof their health,\" the report\nsays.\nAlso endangering them is the\nheavy veil of shame and silence\nthat still hangs over those with the\ndisease in most of Africa.\nHIV-positive women in industrialised\ncountries who become\npregnant, the report notes, receive\nthe anti-retroviral drug Zidovudine,\nbetter known as AZT, from\nat least the 14th week of pregnancy.\nThe drug is administered to infants\nfor six weeks after birth - an expensive regimen.\nHowever, the report observes,\nthere is now some hope for reduced\nmother-to-child transmission\nin the developing world.\n. \"Last year, trials in Thailand of\na short course of AZT (from the\n36th week of pregnancy through\nlabour) given to pregnant women\nwith HIV proved successful in reducing\ntransmission by about 50\nper cent. \"\nAdds the report: \"But even\nmore important in halting the virus's\nspread is access to facilities where women can learn their HIV status in confidential surroundings\nand be counselled about their\nfertility options and the feeding of\ntheir babies\"\nWarns the report: \"Higher\nprevalence among children is one\nindication of the rapid spread of\nthe virus. \"\nMeanwhile, a project coordinator\nwith ActionAid has said most\nanti-Aids campaign strategies are\noutdated.\nDr Linnea Renton of the community\nparticipatory approach Stepping Stones project said Aids\nhad continued to kill many people\nbecause of the lack of new approaches.\nShe said the traditional ABC\nmethod - abstinence, being\nfaithful and condom use - had\nfailed as reflected in high annual\nHIV infection rates despite heavy\ninvestment in anti-Aids campaigns.\nDr Renton told a training workshop\nfor journalists from developing\ncountries at the Royal College\nof Physicians of Edinburgh, Scotland\nlast week that the lack of empowerment\namong women were\ncrucial realities ignored by the\nABC approach.\nElsewhere, an Amref official\nsays previous anti-Aids programmes\nhave ignored .health practitioners in the private sector.\nDr Emmanuel Akatch, a project\nmanager with the African Medical\nResearch Foundation, said a lot of\neffort and resources had been invested\nin enhancing capacities of\npublic health institutions, while\nprivate and church-run ones were\nlargely ignored. A considerable\nnumber of patients seek care from -\nprivate health institutions.\nHe was speaking during a five day\nworkshop at Kisumu's Naselica\nHotel to develop a curriculum\nfor training private sector health\npractitioners on management of\nsexually transmitted diseases on\nWednesday"}
