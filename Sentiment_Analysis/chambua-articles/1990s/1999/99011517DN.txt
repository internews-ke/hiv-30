{"text": "Officer: 87 tested HIV positive in Turkana\nBy NATION Correspondent\nEighty-seven out of 387 people screened for Aids in Turkana District last year tested positive, the acting district medical officer of health, Dr Geoffrey Kasembeli, said yesterday.\nHowever, Dr Kasembeli said the records available did not give a true picture regarding the spread of the disease as the figures were obtained from blood screened for transfusion.\nThe medical officer was addressing an Aids awareness seminar at the Turkwell George.\nHe said Aids testing in the district was hampered by lack of reagents and proper record-keeping. Dr Kasembeli said the Aids awareness campaign had been extended to the Kakuma refuge camp.\nDistrict Commissioner David Amdany appealed to non-governmental organisations and churches working in the district to intensify the campaign against Aids. \nHe said the creation of awareness at the family level was crucial in order to combat the epidemic.\nThe DC made the remarks when he opened the seminar. He said the Lodwar District Hospital had received an Aids test kit from the World Bank-funded Aids project."}
