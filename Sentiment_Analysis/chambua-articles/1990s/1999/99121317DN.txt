{"text": "Key issues ignored at Knut conference\nBy MWAKERA MWAJEFA\nThis year's Kenya National Union of Teachers Annual delegates Conference failed to address important issues affecting the teaching fraternity in the country.\nParticipants at the conference held from December early last month glossed over such pertinent issues as the high death rate among teachers due to HIV Aids, the freeze on teacher recruitment and the controversial examination results from the primary teacher training colleges. These matters either did not feature at all or were mentioned just in passing.\nAnd though the issue of 'the stalled implementation of the 1997 salary awards came up, little light as to the direction the matter was taking, was shed. Instead, the teachers reverted to their mantra saying they were not tired of staging more strikes to force the government to honour its pledge as Education\nMinister Kalonzo Musyoka told them there were no immediate plans to effect the pay rise.\nTwo weeks ago, an assistant Minister for Education Moody Awori said teachers were dying of AIDS faster than the government could replace them. Half the deaths among teachers in Kisumu district were due to Aids, he said.\nTeachers interviewed in Mombasa said they expected the union to outline how it intended to hold workshops and seminars for teachers countrywide as part of the campaign against Aids. Though Mr Awori did not mention how other regions were affected by the pandemic, the revelation pointed to a need for a direct and pro-active strategy by the union to control the menace at least among the teaching fraternity.\nA principal of one of the leading schools in the province said it was disappointing that the delegates did not clear the issue surrounding the mass failures at last year's Primary Teachers examinations and the subsequent remarking that turned the failures into passes.\nAlthough, Mr Adongo touched on the supervision of the teachers burial and benevolent funds, no figures were given on the financial situation of these schemes due to the ever increasing death rate of teachers.\nAlso wanting in clarity was Adongo's brief warning to the government not to disband the Teachers Service Commission. He did not explain the point and this resulted in a lot of anxiety among teachers already worried by plans by the government to retrench 66,000 of them in the next two years.\nMr Adongo merely said the union would resist any attempt to merge TSC and Public Service Commission because teachers could not be served \"under the same employer who also employs the assistant chiefs.\"\nNo mention was made of the impending new educational plan whose transition from the former 8-4-4 system was not clear to the professionals. \nThe government has remained tightlipped since the submission of the report.\nThe meeting was also addressed by Education Permanent Secretary Wilfred Kimalat and Teachers Service Commission Secretary Benjamin Sogomo.\nMr Kimalat criticised the current examination centred system which gave very little room for the testing of the learners practical skills which were part of his/her potentialities.\nHe said: \"Written examinations have been seen to encourage rote learning based on theoretical knowledge while practical skills are not assessed vigorously.\"\nDue to too much pressure on exams, the PS observed, teachers had little time to promote and inculcate the virtues of integrity, moral values and mutual responsibility resulting in frequent cases of violence, riots and destruction of property in learning institutions.\nHe disclosed that the ministry along with all stakeholders were designing visions, missions, systems and processes for which they would be responsible and accountable to the public.\nIn a keynote address on \"Education for Democracy and Civil Responsibilities in the New Millennium,\" a Kenyatta University lecturer, Prof Jack Green Oketch warned that little could be achieved in education if the providers were poorly paid.\nTo enhance national unity and break ethnic barriers, the professor suggested the strengthening of Kiswahili as the national language and develop it into a medium of instruction at all levels of education.\nHe asked the government to restructure the Kenya' Institute of Education by making it more autonomous.\nMr Sogomo cautioned teachers against their pupils."}
