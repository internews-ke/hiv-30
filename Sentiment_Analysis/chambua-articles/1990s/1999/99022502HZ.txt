{"text": "Survey shows schools\nexpected to teach FLE\nBy CATHERINE MGENDI\nMost parents do not discuss\nsexuality issues with their\nchildren, and instead rely on\nschools to teach the topic,\naccording to recent surveys.\nThe surveys found that 30 per\ncent of the parents interviewed\nhad never communicated or\ndiscussed sexuality with their\nadolescent children because they\nbelieved the topic was taught in\nschool.\n\"The parents' reason for\nsilence was that the topic is\nalready taught in school,\" says a\nDecember 1998 publication of a\nnewsletter called Ukweli.\nThe surveys were undertaken\nin more than 400 households in\nKiambu, Nyeri and Nyahururu\nby the Population\nCommunication Africa NGO.\nThese findings bring to the\nfore new dimensions to the\nunresolved controversial debate\non the introduction of family life\neducation in the school\ncurriculum, as was proposed in\nthe Population Policy\nSessional Paper Number\nOne of 1997,\nThe policy paper, which\nstrongly rooted for formal\nteaching of family life education,\nwas shelved after fierce\nopposition particularly from the\nCatholic Church.\nThe Catholic Church said the\nsubject was \"too sensitive\" to\nbe handled just like any other\nsubject.\nIt wanted it taught in the home\nenvironment by parents.\nThe findings show that many\nparents believe that subjects like\nbiology which teaches aspects\nof human growth and\ndevelopment, including the changes associated with puberty,\nand social education and ethics,\nwhich have aspects of\ninterpersonal relationships,\nprovide children with all the\nknowledge on sexuality and\nreproductive health.\n\"Mistakenly,\" the newsletter\nsays. \"many parents assume that\ntheir children are learning\neverything else they need to\nknow, and conclude that this is\nall they need to know. \"\nThe newsletter points out\ngross ignorance on the part of\nparents on what their children are\ntaught in schools.\nThe surveys also found that\n25 per cent of the parents did not\ndiscuss sexuality with their\nchildren because they felt it was\nembarrassing to do so.\nOther parents said the\ndiscussion of the subject at home\nwas traditionally and culturally\ninappropriate.\nEight per cent of parents\ninterviewed admitted lack of\nknowledge on the subject, while\nabout six per cent feared that\ntheir children may have more\nknowledge than they do on the\nsubject.\nThe few parents who believe\nthey impart their teenage\nchildren with the vital\ninformation and knowledge on\nsexuality and reproductive\nhealth, the studies found, do it\nthrough threats and warnings.\n\"I don't want to see you\ntalking to boys. Our family has a\ngood reputation that you must\nalso think about,\" mothers were\nfound to generally caution their\ndaughters.\nSons are told things like:\n\"Keep away from those fast\ngirls; they are nothing more than prostitutes.\" Or, \"If you make a\ngirl pregnant, don't bring her\nhome to me. I have told you\nabout being careful. ' ,\nTypically, says the Ukweli\nnewsletter, no other details are\nprovided on the different types of\nmale-female relationships and\ntheir consequences.\nSays the newsletter: \"For\nparents, it is enough to comment\non some aspect of sexuality to\nraise a related moral issue,\npreach and most importantly to\nthreaten and warn in order to\ndeter premarital sex. \"\nThe authoritarian approach\ntaken by parents amounts to\nsufficient discussion on\nsexuality, which absolves them\nfrom blame or guilt in case of\nanything, says the newsletter.\nAccording to the surveys,\nabout 97 per cent of parents\ndwell on the consequences of sex\nand STDs/HIV (37.7 per cent),\nsex and pregnancy (33.8 per\ncent), and sex, body changes and\nhygiene (25.4 percent).\nLess than three per cent go a\nstep further and tell their children\nabout the prevention of sexually\ntransmitted infections including\nHIV/Aids, and an even smaller\nproportion (0.8 per cent) discuss\nprevention of pregnancy.\nThe adolescents interviewed\nduring the surveys said their'\npreferred sex educators were\nteachers, health personnel and\nchurch leaders in that order of\npreference.\nParents and siblings were the\nnext preferred educators, while\npeers were almost at the bottom\nof the list. However, close to 50 per cent\nof adolescents interviewed said\nthey get their reproductive health\nand sexuality information and\neducation from their peers, while\nclose to 30 per cent get it from\nteachers.\nThe mass media, according to\nthe newsletter, plays a hugely\nsignificant role in adolescent sex\neducation.\nOne of the surveys undertaken\nin Nyeri and Nyahururu found\nthat majority of teenagers were\ntwice as likely to consult the\nmedia than seek advice or\ncounselling.\nThe surveys found that the\nradio plays the most important\nrole in information\ndissemination in both urban\n(47.4 per cent) and rural (46.9\nper cent) settings.\nPamphlets, books and other\nprint media serve an equally.\nimportant role in the rural areas.\nOn the question of parent children\ndiscussions on sexuality\nissues, less than 15 per cent of\nboth groups agreed that they hold\nfrequent discussions on the\nsubject.\nWhile twice as many parents\nas adolescents said they held\n\"frequent\" discussions on the\nsubject, twice as many of the\nadolescent respondents said they\n\"seldom or very rarely\"\ndiscussed sexuality with their\nparents.\n\"Less than 20 per cent of the\nparents admitted they never\ndiscuss sexuality with their\nchildren, while an overwhelming\n55.1 per cent of the adolescents\nsaid never was a better\nrepresentation of the frequency\nof discussions with their\nparents,\" says Ukweli.\nLack of parental guidance regarding adolescence leads to unwanted\npregnancy. A survey shows parents expect schools to teach sexuality."}
