{"text": "TUESDAY OCTOBER 12 1999\n\n\nLack of choices risks women\u2019s health\u2028\n Plight of Women\u2028\n Violence against women is endemic in all countries. Many countries lack legal solutions or power to enforce them. Harmful traditional practices still abound and some 2000,000 girls and women are at flak of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM). Women are nearly two thirds of the world\u2019s 960 million illiterates and women and girls make up three-fifths of the World\u2019s poor.\u2028\n HIV/AIDS is shortening life spans in the worst affected countries\u2028and women are mom vulnerable to HIV infection. Half of new infections are to young people.\u2028\n Youth Factor.\u2028\n Regarding youth and adolescents, in many countries, the- topic of adolescent sexuality and reproductive health is still politically sensitive, and reproductive health information and services simply do not reach most adolescents. Since unprotected sexual relations place adolescent girls at risk for unwanted pregnancies and bath girls and boys at risk for STDs including HlV/AIDS, they seed not only preventive services, but also youth- friendly health services including diagnosis, treatment, and information and counselling. Clinic staff needs special training to treat young clients in a supportive and non-judgmental way. Young adults also need information on family plan and on STDs including\u2028HIV/Aid.\u2028\n Population/ Environment\u2028\n Environmental degradation continues. The poor are mare exposed to fumes and polluted rivers and least able to protect themselves, Of the estimated 2.7 million deaths occurring each year from air pollution,\u2028\n 2.2 million are from indoor pollution and 80% of the victims are rural poor in developing countries.\u2028\n - Resources\u2028\n These conditions can be changed if changing policies; a commitment we make responsible individual to gender equity and equality, choices and take collective action.\n\nOur future will depend on the decisions we make within the next 10 years. Living up to the Cairo commitment\nof US $ 17 billion by the year 2000 for population and development programmes and projects, will go a long way to alleviate these problems and guarantee a better world. The developing countries are two-thirds of the way to their goal of US $ 11.3 billion. The donor countries are only a third to their own goal of US $ 5.7 billion.\nThe Way Forward\nDespite severe resource constraints, the Five-Year review of the implementation experience has shown that an approach to development centred on individual needs\nand aspirations can create integrated programmes for sexual and reproductive\nhealth, advance the empowerment of women and mobilize new partnerships among governments\nand civil society.\nThe technical meetings, roundtables regional 'conferences and intergovernmental meetings of the past year, and dozens of other inquiries arid studies undertaken by governments, international organizations and non-governmental organizations have amply documented the range of progress. They have made recommendations concerning the key areas for further progress in the next stages of implementation.\nSome actions have been easier than others, and progress has been influenced by local and institutional contexts.\nThe Five-Year review of ICPD has clarified what is needed for further advance. Developing countries need Population and development 'policies which establish broad goals clearly linked with the resources to achieve them; institutional structures capable of adapting to changing policies; a commitment to gender equity and equality, greater participation of women in policy and decision making roles  partnership with men ,and action to end gender-based violence.\nThere is need for a rapid movement towards reproductive health service integration and 'better referral systems; more-responsive services, better accountability to the people of whom the services are designed, and intensified attention to staff training, retention and management.\nAll stakeholders need determined action to halt the spread of\nAIDS and save the gains in child survival as well as reverse the rapid rise in mortality rates in countries seriously affected by the pandemic.\nAll stakeholders' need to reinforce their commitment to provide quality reproductive health services and information to young people including unmarried women.\nThe centrality of health reform should be more effective decentralization to the lower levels in order to endure the accessibility of information and services.\nImprovements in the quality and use of data should be emphasized to enable the monitoring\nand evaluation of the programmes.\nCloser collaboration between government, stakeholders and\ncivil society should be emphasized.\nAbove every other need, however,\nis the need to make good the commitment to provide resources.\nWithout this, efforts in developing countries will be slowed and\nin many countries stalled completely.\nA heavy responsibility rests with the donor nations to fill the gap between developing countries' capabilitiess and their needs ."}
