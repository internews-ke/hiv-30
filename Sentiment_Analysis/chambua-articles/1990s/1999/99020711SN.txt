{"text": "SUNDAY NATION, FEBRUARY 7, 1999\nThe do's and don'ts of new wonder drug Viagra\nBy HOUSE DOC\nViagra seems to have turned the\nworld upside down. So that it does not\ndo the same to you, it is important to\nbe aware of its do's and don'ts.\nViagra is a treatment for men with\nerectile dysfunction, otherwise know\nas impotency; This is when a man\ncan't achieve or maintain a hard erect\npenis suitable for sexual activity. It is\nparticularly useful in erectile dysfunction\ncaused by psychogenic\ncauses, but it also helps organic\ncauses like spinal chord injury, diabetes,\ndrugs related impotency and one\nthat follows prostate surgery.\nViagra is not an aphrodisiac and\npeople who have no difficulty in getting\na sustained erection are advised\nnot to use it as a stimulation or 'topping\nup' booster. It does not increase\nsex drive nor does it affect fertility.\nViagra is dispensed in three doses.\nThe recommended starting dose is the\nmiddle dose. Based on its effectiveness\nand tolerance it may be adjusted\nto one notch, up or down. The drug\nworks by increasing blood flow into the cavernous spaces of the penis and\ntakes about an hour to be effective.\nHence it should be swallowed at the\nright time before planned sexual activity.\nExcess fat in the meal slows\ndown the absorption and delays its action.\nAppropriate adjustments must\ntherefore be made for this. Even\nthough vasodilatation caused by the\ndrug results in erection, normal sexual\nstimulation and foreplay are essential.\nViagra is not indicated for use in\nwomen. Research however done in female\nrats and rabbits showed no teratogenic effects.\nViagra offers no protection against\nsexually transmitted disease including\nHIV/Aids. Precautions against\nthese and pregnancy are therefore\nvital.\nViagra is not to be taken if a person\nis on medications containing nitrate,\na compound commonly used for relief\nof chest pain caused by angina pectoris.\nIt should be taken with caution if\none has a heart or liver problem, low\nblood pressure, rare inherited eye disease\ncalled retinitis pigmentosa, sickIe cell anaemia, leukaemia, cancer of\nthe bone marrow, any disease or deformity\nof the penis, stomach ulcer\nand bleeding disorders.\nWith this formidable list of contraindications\nit is natural that the drug\nshould only be taken on doctors' prescription.\nBuying it over the counter\nis both illegal and unsafe. The only\nside effects of the drug are headache\nand facial flushing. Less common ill\neffects which have been documented\nare dizziness, indigestion and visual\naberrations."}
