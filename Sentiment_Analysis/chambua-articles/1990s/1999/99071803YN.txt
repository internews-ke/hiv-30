{"text": "Aids conference held in Nyeri\nBy WAWERU MUGO\nYouth group leaders in Nyeri\nDistrict attended a workshop that\nwere empowered them with various\nskills that would enable them\nfight the dreaded HIV/Aids virus.\nAs peer educators, the participants\nare expected to pass on the\nknowledge gained at the two day\nworkshop which was held at the\nCentral Hotel to their peers. The workshops main goal was to arm the youth with knowledge that would help curb HIV/Aids infection amongst their peers. They were specifically encouraged\nto practise abstinence from sex because so far it was\nthe surest way of keeping the killer virus at bay.\nThe workshop was sponsored by Unicef and was organised\nby a Christian NGO, Medical Assistance Programme\nInternational (MAPI). All the 25 participants were youth\ngroups leaders from various churches in the district.\nAmalemba said it was a pity that there has been a more emphasis on the use of condoms to prevent HIV/Aids than\non abstinence.\n\"As a result, rather than discourage sex amongst the\nyouth. it encouraged them to engage under the misguided notion that all would be okay if they used condoms, he explained:'\nParticipants were educated on what HIV/Aids is, its\nmodes of transmission and they also received other information on sexually transmitted diseases. Lucy Maina, 18, of the Nyeri Urban Project said, \"I have learned quite a lot in the workshop and I will' pass it on to my church youth group.\"\nTirus Ngari, 19, a leader at PEFA church, Stella Njeri, 18, Emma Njoki Wamae, 18, and Isack Theuri of Gichira PCEA\nwere among the participants. Isaack  called on the youth not to abandon peers who have lost direction.\n\"Try to win them over. Stay pure by setting your goals early and living a religious life which is vital in the fight against the spread of HIV/Aids,\" he advised.\nNjeri advised young people to go for testing before marriage to confirm their HIV status.\nChris Mwalwa, a preacher who was one of the organisers explained to the Young Nation that similar workshops have been held at Homa Bay, Kisumu, Nakuru, Kilifi, Machakos, Embu and thrice in Nairobi.\n\"This, workshop is the last one. We have reached and trained about 200 youths each of whom is expected to reach a similar number,\" explained Mwalwa. He said \"Religious bodies\ncan play a pivotal role in stemming the . HIV/Aids in the country,\" he said.\nThe youth who attended a MAP workshop in Nyeri town recently' Picture By MARTIN TELEWA"}
