{"text": "FRIDAY OCTOBER 8 1999\n\nMINISTRY OF HEALTH\u2028\n In 1987 the Government of Kenya created the AIDS Programme Secretariat (APS) to organize the\nnation's efforts against AIDS. The National AIDS and STDs Control Programme (NASCOP) was\ncreated within the Ministry of Health to be the major implementing organization of the Government's\nprogramme. Also in 1987 APS developed a Medium Term Plan (MTP 1) for the period 1987-1991.\nThat plan focused on public awareness campaigns, strengthening of laboratory services,\nsurveillance of HIV/AIDS and training of health workers. In 1992, the second Medium Term Plan\n(MTP 11 19921996) was prepared. Although the MTP 11 has not been fully implemented due to a\nnumber, of constraints, it does represent an attempt to design a comprehensive intervention\nprogramme for Kenya.\nA five year strategic plan (1999-2003) which defines priority areas for interventions taking into\nconsideration the Ministry of Health's comparative advantage and strength within a multisectoral\nenvironment was officially launched in August 1999 .. '\nThis plan builds on the multi sectorial approach which was initiated in MTP 11 and draws its\nstrength from the Sessional Paper No.4 of 1997 on AIDS in Kenya ..\nAs a guiding principle in developing the plan, NASCOP Management Unit in conjunction with the\nmajor stakeholders involved in the fight against HIV/AIDS in Kenya, evolved the following Mission\nStatement:\nTo Provide a Policy and Strategic Framework\nFor Mobilising and co-ordinating Resources\nTo Prevent HIV/AIDS Transmission and\nProvide Care and Support\nTo the Infected and Affected People\nIn Kenya\nThe purpose of the plan is to provide a framework and serve as an effective tool for resource\nmobilisation and co-ordination, as well as to guide the implementation of activities at the district\nlevel. In addition, the Plan underscores the need for the Ministry of Health through NASCOP. to\nprovide strategic leadership in all matters pertaining to STDs/HIV/AIDS management in Kenya.\nSeven key strategies which are principally the same as defined in the past two strategic plans\n(MTP- I and II) were formulated.\nThese are:\n1. Reduction in HIV Prevalence through Promotion of behaviour Change and Advocacy\nAdvocacy and social mobilisation\n- Community participation and partnership\nCapacity building Service delivery-linked health promotion\nCondom programming.\n\nBlood safety\nDevelopment and implementation of a National blood policy to govern transfusion practices\nEstablishment and strengthening of National, Provincial and district blood transfusion centres\nTo establish blood donor education and recruitment programmes\nDevelop mechanisms of monitoring rational use of blood\nDevelop mechanisms for quality control on HIV/STD/AIDS screening.\n\nContinuum of care and support\nStrengthen clinical management and nursing care of opportunistic infections, including\ntuberculosis \u2022\nProvide social support\nPrevention of the spread of opportunistic and HIV infection through appropriate infection control\nguidelines and measures ..\n4. Treatment and Control of Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs)\nSyndroinic Management of STDs\nEstablishment of aetiological surveillance of STDs\nProvide Syphilis screening at all ante-natal clinics .. _\nMobilization and capacity building of private practitioners in STD management. .\nEpidemiology and Research\nCapacity building\nReliable behavioural and epidemiological surveillance\n\u2022 Prioritisation research needs and research co-ordination.\n6. Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission of HIV\nPrevent vertical transmission through screening, Family Planning and Health Education.\nEmpower Women to negotiate for safer sex with their partners\nConduct Research on factors influencing Mother to Child Transmission of HIV.\nMitigation of the Socio-Economic Impact of HIVIAIDS\nAdvocacy\nCommunity Mobilisation and participation\nMonitoring the Impact of AIDS at Community level and other sectors\nMitigation programmes on the Social Economic Impact research\nStrengthening household and Community coping Capacity.\nIn addition to the above strategies, others are:\nStrengthening programme management and co-ordination\nResource mobilisation ,\n\u2022 Ensure programme sustainability\nStrengthen monitoring and evaluation activities .\nIssues pertaining to feasibility, cost, capacity to implement the appropriate strategies that would\nproduce the maximum change were taken into consideration while developing the above strategies.\nMANAGEMENT AND CO-ORDINATION OF THE MULTISECTORAL AIDS CONTROL\nPROGRAMME\nThe successful implementation of the National Programme requires comprehensive and effective\nand management and co-ordination arrangements to be in place.\nIn this respect, there are a number of complex issues that have to be taken into account, principle\namong which are:\nHIV/AIDS is a multi-sectoral issue, requiring a multi-sectoral response. The range of\nstakeholders is therefore diverse\n\u2022 The National Programme has to be implemented at district level and below Substantial funding\nis .\na variety of sources\nIt is beyond the capacity of the Ministry of Health to implement the Programme using entirely-its\nown staff. A wide range of implementing partners and collaborators is therefore required.\n\nThe National AIDS Council\n\nThe Sessional Paper Number 4 on AIDS in Kenya, makes provision for the ~establishment of a National\nAIDS Council. This will be a high level, multi-sectoral body that will be charged with the responsibility for\ndeveloping, and monitoring the progress of, a comprehensive National policy in response to the AIDS\nepidemic.\nAlthough the National AIDS Council has yet to be established, it is expected that this will happen before\nthe end of 1999. The establishment of the NAC is unlikely to affect the implementation structure at\ndistrict level. However, in formulating sector specific programmes, it is possible that the NAC will bring\nabout the involvement of more implementing partners than at present. In summary, the role of NASCOP\nat the National level will be mainly, policy formulation, development of guidelines and standards,\nresource mobilisation and allocation, establishing linkages with relevant departments and sectors such\nas National Public Health Laboratories and providing strategic direction to the districts.\n\nSources of Funds for NASCOP\nActions can be taken to slow the spread of HIV in Kenya and to avert the serious personal, social and\neconomic consequences that would result from a continued AIDS epidemic. Much is being done today\nin Kenya to care for HIV/AIDS patients and to educate people about the dangers of AIDS. However,\nthese efforts are not enough. HIV is still spreading rapidly in most parts of Kenya. In order for\nprevention efforts to succeed, a number of changes are required. Among the most important are:\n\u2022 Strong political commitment by all leaders. Experience from development programmes around\nthe world has shown that with a difficult problem such as AIDS, the strong support of the top\nleaders of the country is crucial to success.'\nAdoption of a multi-sectoral approach to AIDS interventions. It is clear that AIDS is not just a\nhealth problem. It will affect all areas of society. It will affect individuals, families, villages,\ntowns, economic growth and social development. Therefore, it is important that all sectors of\nsociety be involved in the solution to this problem including government, NGOs, private sector\norganizations, religious organizations, unions, professional societies, etc.\nEstablishment of an effective national coordinating body with strong leadership and the backing\nof the Office of the President, international donor agencies, N.GOs and all Kenyans. This is\nnecessary in order to effectively coordinate a multi-sectoral approach to AIDS prevention.\n\u2022 Strengthening of STDs treatment at all levels as a strategy for HIV prevention.\n\u2022 Introduction of AIDS education into school curricula in order to inform young people about how\nto stop AIDS. '\n\u2022 Substantially increased funding from the government, local communities, private sector\norganizations, and organizational donors.\nHIV/AIDS/STDS Control activities in Kenya are supported by a number of agencies. These are:\n~\ni) Ministry of Health through the STI project.\ni1) Donors (through the Government and private sector, NGOS, CSOs)\niii) NGOs (some major NGOs e.g. AM REF, support HIV/AIDS Control activities from locally\nmobilised resources in partnership with the privat~ sector)\niv. Religious organisations \\\nv. The Private Sector\nvi. Other Government Ministries and departments\nvii. Communities (through community action and direct out of pocket payment to assist the\naffected and the infected).\n\nRisks\nThe Sessional Paper Number 4 on AIDS in Kenya, makes provision for the ~establishment of a National\nAIDS Council.

The main risk is that in the past four years the World Bank financed STI project has been\nthe main source of funding for NASCOP programmes. This project comes to a close early 2001. The\nKenya Government has approached the World Bank for further assistance through the Health Services\ndependent on international donors to an extent that the World Health Organisation assistance ended\nSustainability of programme financing will be discussed within the broader context of National AIDS\nCouncil to be established before the end of 1999.
