{"text": "No cemeteries as Aids kills more\nCemeteries in Zimbabwe are unable to cope with the Aids pandemic, now killing at least 1,200 people a week amid chronic poverty and economic misery.\nIn the southern African nation, the basic death rate in 1998 was over three times higher than it would have been without Aids. A quarter of the adult population has Aids or the virus, according to the United Nations.\nThe death rate is expected to be more than four times as high by the year 2010, according to the Harare-based non-governmental organisation, Southern Africa Aids Information Dissemination Services (SAFAIDS).\nZimbabwe was last year ranked the worst affected country in the world, with the UNAIDS agency estimating that 1.5 million people, or some 25 per cent of adults were infected with the Human Immuno-Deficiency Virus (HIV), the precursor to Aids.\nLast month, the country launched voluntary Aids testing and counselling centres with much pomp and publicity. The pandemic has emerged as the greatest threat to economic and social wellbeing of\nZimbabwe.\nThe shortage of burial ground has led to a public campaign to promote cremation, which is a taboo in traditional cultural beliefs, to save space as Aids claims hundreds of lives daily.\nWith more than a quarter of the 5.5 million adult Zimbabweans HIV-infected, hundreds of thousands of children are pushed to the brink 'Of orphanhood. The government estimates that there will be over 900,000 children under 15 without parents by the year 2000.\nState hospitals and major private clinics cannot cope and prematurely discharge Aids patients.\nThe Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (Aids) is expected to kill 80,000 Zimbabweans this year alone, bringing the cumulative toll to 590,000 since the start of the epidemic some 14 years ago. \n\nSouth Africa's HIV/Aids epidemic has been one of the last to develop because of the country's geographical position in Africa, and it is in its early stages, according to the government.\nHowever, though a relative \"newcomer\", the epidemic has grown rapidly, with about 1,500 new infections estimated a day, and it is one of South Africa's biggest worries.\nAlready about 3.6 million people are living with the infection, from a population of about 42 million, with another 550,000 new infections expected each year.\nIt is estimated that in the overall adult population aged 15-59 years, between 12 and 14 per cent are HIV infected. \nProjections are that within three years, almost a quarter-of-a-million South Africans will die every year from Aids and this figure will rise to half a million every year by 2008, according to the government.\nAverage life expectancy is likely to plummet from 64 years to 40 by 2008, while it is feared there will be about a million children under the age of 15 who have lost their mothers to AIDS by 2005.\nA 1998 survey of pregnant women showed that 22.8 per cent were infected.\nThe government is investigating buying the drug Nevirapine, which apparently reduces mother-to child transmission, but it has angered the public by not making the anti-Aids transmission drug AZT available freely to women who are raped or who are infected and pregnant.\nHealth officials said it was too risky to spend limited resources on an expensive drug while its effectiveness is uncertain.\nGovernment also refused to allow human trials on the locally developed anti-Aids drug Virodene.\nThe epidemic could affect affirmative action policies as levels of infection are higher in the black population, according to a document submitted to the 1999 Southern Africa Economic Summit. Talking openly about Aids in Uganda, where the disease has claimed half a million lives, has helped to cut the rate of HIV infection by half over the last six years, according to the professor heading a national programme.\nBefore the launch of a huge public awareness campaign six years ago, Aids and HIV were taboo subjects, not discussed in public, and covered up when known to be the cause of a relative's death.\nNow the disease is frequently raised by politicians, and talked about in schools, the workplace and in the home. According to John Rwomushana, Director General of the Uganda Aids Commission (UAC), a campaign to bring HIV/Aids into the open has paid off, with infection rates in the most affected areas and among the most sexually active age groups showing dramatic falls.\nThe campaign features roadside billboards advising\n\"If you can't abstain, use a condom,\" as well as seminars and workshops.\nUgandans are encouraged to test for HIV infection. The process is free, quick and accompanied by counselling.\nHIV/Aids nevertheless remains a considerable health problem in Uganda, where at least 1.5 million people, 7.5 per cent of the population, are estimated to be HIV-positive.\nUgandans use some 80 million condoms annually.\nThe government plans to import 10 million to meet demand.\nChildren are among the worst-affected sector of society. A million children are thought to have been orphaned by Aids and many have become family heads at a very young age. Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, is sleepwalking to an Aids disaster, with little or no government action to tackle what many still see as a \"white man's disease\", experts say.\n\"It is a disaster. There is next to no government\naction and no-one sees quite how serious this is\"\n one health worker said.\nOfficial figures estimate that six million people in\nNigeria, five per cent of the 108-120 million population, have the Human Immuno deficiency Virus (HIV) that causes Aids.\nBut Aids workers think the real figure is double that a new survey is due out soon and project that within a generation, the figure could reach 30 to 35 per cent or tens of millions of people.\n\"The world is holding its breath in horror and anticipation of the disaster that wil\\ befall us if we do not take effective steps to stop the spread of Aids in our country,\" former health minister Professor\nOlikoye Ransome-Kuti told a gathering in Lagos earlier this year.\n\"It might even be too late to avert the impending disaster. Maybe we can oniy ameliorate it,\" he said.\nUnder the military governments that ruled Nigeria from 1983 to May this year, a National Aids and\nSTD (sexualIy transmitted disease) Control Programme was set up but the programme is poorly funded, officials admit.\nAids deaths are often hushed up. In one small rural clinic alone in northeastern Benue State, 282 people died last year of Aids but usually, Aids deaths are not recorded as such for fear of the stigma.\nCurrently, the most active organisations combating the growth of Aids in Nigeria are foreign donors, importing contraceptives, and seeking to change attitudes about the disease.\nThe director 'Ofthe UNAIDS office in Nigeria left last month and has yet to be replaced. \n\nMuslim \"action commandos\" have become one of the biggest obstacles in the fight against Aids in Niger, according to medical professionals in Niamey.\nFigures from the health ministry in the capital of the mainly desert nation in west Africa show that more than 5,000 people suffer from Aids in Niger, where 90 per cent of inhabitants are Muslim.\nAids experts say that in 1994, when the government launched a five-year plan to fight the disease, Islamic associations expressed their hostility towards awareness campaigns.\nIslamic members would often disrupt seminars and conferences on the issue, while prostitutes considered by Islamists as vectors of the virus were subjected to severe, punitive measures.\nAnd those responsible for campaigns promoting condom use often received death threats by Muslim extremists. In contrast, the campaign against \"western methods of prevention,\" is very much public, with, marabouts, or respected traditional healers, using sermons and media spots as forums for their message.\n\"For Muslims, abstinence and fidelity are the only acceptable means to avoid Aids,\" said a marabout in a television programme broadcast last week.\n\"A condom remains an instrument which invites\ndebauchery and adultery,,\" said Elhadj Noufou, an imam in Niamey.\n-AFP"}
