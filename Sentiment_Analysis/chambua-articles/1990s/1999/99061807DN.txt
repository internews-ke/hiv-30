{"text": "Tourism poised for recovery\nAccording to the Economic Survey 1999,\ntourist arrivals declined from 1,000,600 in\n1997 to 894,300 in 1998. As a result, earnings\nfrom the sector fell by 22.7 per cent '.to Sh 17.5\nbillion.\nThere is need to revive this sector which\nemploys more than 200,000 Kenyans.\nThe government's decision to waive visas\nfor tourists from eight countries in the traditional\nEuropean market is a, gigantic step\ntowards reviving the industry.' The government\nmust be commended for this bold move\nthat has been well received abroad.\nThe Budget proposals unveiled last week\nspeech by the Minister for Finance offer further\nhope to those of us in the industry. However,\ninsecurity and the deteriorating road\nnetwork countrywide are a source of concern.\nThe decision to increase funding for road\nmaintenance from Sh6.5 billion to Sh7.7 billion\nis welcome. However, beginning work in\nsome designated areas in January 2000 will\ninconvenience some members of the Kenya\nAssociation of Hotel Keepers and Caterers.\nSecondly, while the Tourism minister\nclearly envisages the formation of the Kenya\nTransport Board soon, there is need to put in place a monitoring mechanism even on an adhoc\nbasis so that the progress in this area can\nbe closely appraised in terms of speed, quality\nand expenditure control.\nIn regard to the catering levy, members of\nthe association have repeatedly expressed concern\nover the fact that the Catering Levy Trustee\nspends more than over 60 per cent of the\nrevenue it collects on administrative matters.\nIt is in this regard that we welcome the\ndecision by the government to transfer the\nlevy collection function to the Kenya Revenue\nAuthority. The government should re-define\nthe role of the Catering Levy Trustee or abolish\nit.\nFurther, the decision by the government to\nallocate 50 per cent of the levy collected to the\nKenya Tourist Board will have wider ramifications.\nKenya Utalii College, which has\nbeen the principle beneficiary of this levy,\nwill have to do with reduced income.\nIf the high standards of the college are to be\nmaintained, alternative sources of funding\nmust be found. The college must emulate the\npublic universities which are now generating\ntheir own incomes come on their own to fund\nsome of their operations. The Kenya Tourist Board must undertake\nvigorous campaigns to market the country as a\nfavourable tourist destination.\nAs an association, we are grateful to the\nEuropean Union for undertaking to give the\nthe tourist board Shl40 million.\nand whose disbursement we now understand\nwill be finalised soo\nLike in other sectors of the economy, the\nAids scourge is a problem in the tourism\nindustry. The number of those infected with\nthe HIV virus nationally rose from 725,121 in\n1993 to 1,416,000 in 1997. Some of these\npeople were men and women in our industry.\nBesides the loss of trained manpower due\nto Aids, employers must shoulder increased\nexpenses on medical care. The Aids control\nprogramme must be incorporated within the\nbudgetary framework.\nThe association is are now convinced that\nthe worst is over for the industry. We must\nlearn from our past mistakes and rebuild from\nthere.\nPatrick W. Muriuki,\nChairman Kenya Association of Hotelkeepers\nand Caterers, Nairobi"}
