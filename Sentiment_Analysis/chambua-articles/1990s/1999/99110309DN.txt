{"text": "Malawi speaks out on Aids\nBLANTYRE, Tuesday\nWhen Malawi's President Bakili Muluzi\nfinally decided to break the silence over\nthe Aids epidemic sweeping through his\ncountry, he did it in style.\nHe invited prostitutes, villagers, soldiers,\nHIV victims, schoolchildren and\nthe media to a public meeting in Blantyre\nlast week to announce an ambitious five year\nplan to roll back the disease.\nReflecting the years of official neglect\nas an estimated one million Malawians\n- out of a population of 11 million became infected with the Aids virus,\nPresident Muluzi told the meeting: \"Our\nbiggest achievement today is that we\nhave summoned the courage to speak\nabout this terrible HIV/Aids pandemic\npublicly.\n\"We have broken the deathly silence.\nToday we have joined the rest of the\nworld in declaring war against the\npandemic.\"\nCritics say President Muluzi's crusade\ncomes several years too late, but the\nlaunch was effective in a conservative society where sexual topics have long\nbeen taboo.\nThe 2,000 people at the meeting were\nastonished by a young woman who\nshrugged off traditional constraints and\nadmitted to being HIV-positive.\n\"I can see faces refusing to believe that\nI am HIV-positive,\" said Ms Thereza\nKampeni. \"The truth is that I am,\nalthough I look healthy and have no\nsigns of suffering.\"\nShe said she had the right4to refuse to\ndisclose how she became infected, but added: \"I can leave it up to you to\nguess. \"\nMs Kampeni said that through a network\nof people living with Aids she was\nchampioning the rights of victims and\nfighting discrimination.\n\"We have accepted our condition and\nwe don't feel guilty or ashamed,\" she\nsaid, calling for a change in sexual\nbehaviour to stop the spread of the\ndisease.\nThe Malawi army, where infection rates are high, has joined' the new drive\nagainst Aids. \"We are now coming out in\nthe open and admitting we have a problem,\"\nMajor Mafrumu Gondwe told AFP.\nMajor Gondwe, who was manning an\nexhibition at the meeting of how the\narmy is tackling the Aids problem, said\nthe European Union and the United\nNations were funding efforts to' spread\nthe anti-Aids message among soldiers.\nCondoms are now part of a soldier's\nkit, he said.
