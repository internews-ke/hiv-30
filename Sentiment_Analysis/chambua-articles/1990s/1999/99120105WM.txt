{"text": "\u2022\u2022 Aids problem.\" \u2022\nKisumu's going public about\n./ Aids in the district has borne\nfruits. But in other regions, mentioning\n.Aids is tantamount to\ninvoking evil spirits. The people\nwho are aware of Aids remain\nquiet for fear of inviting the wrath\nof elders who are bewildered by\nthe reality of Aids.\nThose quiet places thought to be\n'safe' from Aids are a time bomb\nwaiting to explode, says Nyang' .\nDistrict commissioners. from\nNandi and Nyando have visited\nKisumu to learn what they can do\nfor' the areas they administer. In\nNyando, efforts to fight Aids are\ngathenng steam. DC Paul Olando\nsays he must talk bravely about\nAids because if he fails to do so\nhe will not have people to lead. '\nNyando is in the sugar belt and\ntherefore attracts migrant labourers\nwho do not travel with their I\nwives. \"there is a lot of money in\ncirculation in Chemilil, Muhoroni,\nSondu and Miwani and this\nencourages casual sex,\" says Mr\nOlando. The district is said to have\none of the higher HIV infection\nrates in the province .\nThe Sondu Miriu hydro-electric\nproject under construction is\nalready attracting business people\nto the area. DC Olando fears that\nwhat ever benefits it brings, it\ncould Just be a sign of problems to\ncome.\n\"We are planning programmes\nfor awareness as soon as there are\nactivities in the area. We will supply\ncondoms to these people as\nwell.\"\nSaying it loud~ prevention is better ~h~ infection: As the world marks the World Aids Day today\nstatistics show that two million people in Kenya are living with the Aids virus.\nGood news but time\nIto take bull by the horn\nBy KWAMBOKA OYARO\nToday is the international Aids\nday. For Kenyans. there is a\nray of hope, for President Moi\nhas just declared the Aids epidemic\na national disaster and\nspelling out the way forward\nfor !he country, though belated,\n~sa step towards lacing the\nreality of the lethal disease.\nThe news that our parliamentarians\ntook time out of their normal\nbusiness to fly to Mombasa\nto discuss the Aids\npandemic is encouraging. It is\ngood news that finally they\nhave decided to confront the\nproblem.\nBut was it necessary for the\nparliamentarians to change\nbase and take chartered flights\nto Mombasa to talk about\nAids? Wouldn't they have\ndone so in the august house?\nFor the last 10 years, people\nhave been dying of Aids but\nthe honourable members have\nhidden their faces in the sand.\ncreating the impression that all\nis well in their constituencies.\nInstead of guiding the people\nthey lead, they watch as they\nperish each day. Isn't the tragedy\nof burying about 500 Kenyans\nevery day after dying\nfrom Aids related ailments, a\nreason to be somber or even\nfast as strategies of combating\nAids are laid?\n\u2022 President Moi early this year\nsensed that his people are perishing\nfrom Aids and started a\ncampaign of persuading young\npeople to amend their ways in\norder to check the spread of\nthe menace. He has also been\nadvising people whose relatives\ndie of the ailment to state\nclearly the cause of their\ndeaths instead of saying they\ndied of short illnesses so as to\nhelp in creating awareness. But the MPs did not take this cue and\nembark on a national anti-Aids\ncampaign.\nThe begging question now is\nwhether they will. After staying\nlavishly Mombasa. lead the\ncampaign on Aids and take the\nmessage to their constituents. the\npeople ravaged by the epidemic\none way or another.\nsince the scour is doing a lot\nof damage to the country.\nCouldn\u2019t the honourable members\u00b7\nspare the staggering Sh3 million\nused to organise the four-day\nsymposium and buy mediation \u2022\nfor the millions of Aids orphans\nin the country? The money would\nhave been enough to feed all the\norphans in the country for one\nweek or more.\nHowever. their coming out to\ndeclare Aids an emergency a step\nforward in reducing the scourge.\nOur society, depends greatly on\nwhat leaders say. If they are quiet\nabout Aids, then the general population\nwill think the media is just\ngiving alarming statistics and that\nthe sensitisation programmes\nbeing undertaken by NGOs are\nbaseless fear invoking tirades.\nTeachers, village elders, chiefs,\nchurch leaders and all other opinion \nleaders., if committed to fight-\nII1gthe scourge, will change people's\nfatal attitudes towards Aids.\nThe fact that students will be\ntaught special lessons from next\nJanuary is a ray of hope because\nIgnorance is a major contributor\nto the spread of the virus. With\nknowledge, a pace has been set\nand now it is the duty of every\nKenyan to change from within. In\nthis way, like it happened in\nUganda, the statistics will start\ndwindling and eventually, hopefully\nAids will be kicked out of\nKenya!"}
