Policy makers are beginning\u2028\nto understand that there are links among \nmalnutrition among women, gender-\u2028\nbased violence, the spread of Aids, and women\u2019s vulnerability to diseases such as TB\u2028\nThe idea of integrated reproductive health is\u2028\ngaining ground\u2028\nThere ta some very bad news. At the end of\u2028\nevery year there are still a million more\u2028\npeople than the year before - and this growth\u2028\nwill continue,\u2028\nWith 100 million births a year. and over a\u2028\nbillion young people entering their childbearing years. there is no danger of a \u201cbirth dearth\u201d.\u2028\nThe bulk of this growth is in poor countries and\u2028\namong poor families.\u2028\nIn the midst of greater wealth than the world\u2028\nhas ever seen, a billion people still Live without\u2028\nthe elements of human dignity - clean water,\u2028\nenough food, secure housing, basic education\u2028\naid health care. About 350 million women do\u2028\nnot have the means or information to decide on\u2028\nthe size and spacing of their families,\u2028\nNearly 600,000 die each year as result of\u2028\nbeing pregnant, 70,000 from unsafe and illegal\u2028\nabortions An unknown number suffer infection\u2028\nor injury- For women m developing countries\u2028\nreproduction is the greatest single threat to\u2028\nhealth,\u2028\nThese conditions can be changed - everyone\u2028\nagrees on that The means to reduce maternal\u2028\nmortality and provide reproductive health care\u2028\nare well known and affordable.\u2028\nIn fact \nby the year 2000. This is what the world\u2028\non armaments in a week About a third\u2028\nof that was supposed to confront the rich\u2028\ncountries, and the from the developing\u2028\ncountries themselves,\u2028\nThe developing countries are about two-\u2028\nthirds of the way to their goal.\u2028\nThe donor countries are only about a third of\u2028\nthe way to theirs. Of the 35.7 billion that they\u2028\nwere  provide by nest year. less than S2 billion is forthcoming. , - -\u2028\nA few countries \u2014 including Denmark, Fin\u2028\nland, the Netherlanda, Norway. Sweden and\u2028\nthe UK\u2014 have fulfilled their past of the bargain But some biggest donors have not,\u2028\nIt is time to ask the question \u2014 what sort of\u2028\nworld do we want? At the end of the 20th century. we have the means ta provide a decent\u2028\nlife for everyone on the planet sustainability and eliminate poverty- Or we can let\u2028\nthings slide, with what consequences we do\u2028\nnot fully know.\u2028\nFor a small amount of money, relatively\u2028\nspeaking, we have the means not merely to\u2028\nsave lives, but to transform them. And we\u2028\neats do should do it.\u2028"}
