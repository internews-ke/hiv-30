{"text": "Anti-Aids drive not adequate\nBy-CHURCHllL OTIENO\nAnti-Aids campaigns have\nfailed to reach communities at\nthe grassroots, leading to increased HIV infection rates.\nUnicef Country Director Crispin\nWilson said yesterday that\n35 Kenyans contract HIV daily\nand warned that continued delays in decision making would\nonly make the virus spread\nfurther.\nClosing a three-day Aids\nmeeting at Imperial Hotel,\nKisumu, Mr Wilson said most\nprevention activities had failed to reach the grassroots, hence\nthe continuing spread of HIV.\nSo far, only the British-funded\nSh880 million HIV/Aids Prevention\nand Care project had\nmoved to the grassroots by\nworking with community-based\norganisations, Mr Wilson noted.\nGovernment bodies and\nNGOs working on Aids prevention\nand control in Nyanza sent\nrepresentatives. Also present\nwere the Nyanza PC, Mr Peter\nRaburu, and the Hapac project\ncoordinator, Mr Donald W.\nDickerson. Mr Wilson said all organisations\ncurrently fighting Aids had\nheld seminars in almost all\ntowns but had not even pitched\ntent in a village. He called for\nmassive mobilisation at the\ncommunity level.\nThe Unicef boss criticised the\nchurch, saying it was part of a\nconspiracy of silence. He argued\nthat 80 per cent of Kenyans were\nChristians, 15 million of whom\nattended religious meetings, yet\nclerics played a minimal role in\nthe fight against Aids.\nThe meeting resolved to establish\na Nyanza Provincial Aids\n.Day as a strategy to fight the\nspread of the disease.\nParticipants said the Nyanza\nAids Day will be marked by ensuring\nactivities in all other sectors\nstop and' a presidential address\nis given, which will be\nsimultaneously read to rural audiences\nby DCs, DOs, chiefs and\ntheir assistants.\nPolice will be asked to stop all\ntraft1c and business premises\nwill remain closed. They said\nthe campaign should be held in\nthe middle of  the week."}
