{"text": "Immorality on the increase\nImmorality is increasing. In the media you\ncan't miss the violence in the world, defilement\nof minors, prostitution, homosexuality\nand so on.\nThere are heart-wrenching stories of children\nforced into prostitution. Most of those\nchildren are girls and the criminal sex traffickers,\njust like other opportunistic middlemen,\nare exploiting the situation while society has\nsimply turned the other way.\nThese systematic forms of discrimination\nand violence against the girl child cannot be\ndiscounted as accidents. Violence against girls\ncan occur at birth or even before. Despite the\nincreased life expectancy of women, their exploitation\nis one of the key forces driving HIV/Aids. I\nSexual assault is a sin. Everyone has an absolute,\nsovereign right to their own body. This\nfreedom is bestowed upon us by God to live\nwith dignity. Sexual assault destroys the trust\nand respect among people as well as bringing\ngreat harm to the victims.\nOur silence and indifference not only increases\nthe number of victims, but also make\nthe doer unable to repent the sin in time. Men\nwho prefer fellow men but who are afraid to\ndefy society's taboos may spend a lifetime in\nmarriage and fathering ..\nHowever, where homosexuality is out-lawed, prevention programmes are seldom developed.\nIn North America, homosexuality remains\nbe the most predominant mode of HIV\ntransmission. In the English-speaking Caribbean,\nit is passed on in men-women relations\nand on to children.\nThe French relief agency, Doctors Without\nBorders, has reported that the incidence of rape\nin Rwanda defies imagination ... It appears that\nevery adult woman and every adolescent girl\nwho escaped the massacre of 1994 by soldiers\nand Hutu militia was raped.\nReports of systematic rape as a tactic of war\nhave received little attention. Rwanda's ministry\nof family and women's affairs estimated\nthat between April 1994 and 1995 more than\n15,700 girls and women between the ages of\n13 and 65 were raped. Some women were\ngang-raped, some were forced to watch their\nfamilies murdered and then raped and some\nwhere taken as prizes of war and then raped.\nOthers were coerced into living in the homes\nof the men who had raped them.\nIn Kenya recently, a woman who had sex\nwith a dog had to be operated on. She said he\nwas forced into the act by a white man who had\npicked her up in the streets.\nDuring an interview with women at a hotel,\none said: \"I am sitting here waiting for men because\nI need money.\" The sins occurring today are not any different\nfrom those that happened in the biblical\ntowns of Sodom and Gommorrah.\nThe Bible records many cases of sexual assault:\nLet us review one of them. The son of\nKing David fell in love with his beautiful half sister,\nTamar. So he became ill. He then\nplanned and raped her. After his evil act he hated\nher and ordered her to go away. Tamar's\nown brother later murdered the rapist. This is\nrecorded in Samuel 13:1-27.\"\nWe often interpret this murder in the house\nof David as God's punishment to him, but\ncompletely disregard the situation of Tamar,\nthe victim.\nHer dignity vanished but Amno could escape\nfrom the law. Though David was extremely\nangry about this case, he did nothing\nto help Tamar or to punish Amno. Absalomon\ncould do nothing but kill Amno to avenge his\nsister. For sin pays its wage-death!\nDeuteronomy 28:1-68: \"If you obey the\nlord your God and faithfully keep all his commands\nthat I am giving you today, he will\nmake you greater than any other nation on\nearth. \"\nBut if you disobey, God will punish you and\nyour descendants.\nKambale Kazi.\nNairobi."}
