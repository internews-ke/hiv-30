{"text": "No one can say they've heard enough of Aids\nLucy Oriang\nIf you are one of those people who feel\nthey've heard enough about Aids in the\npast week to last them a lifetime, spare a\nthought for the unwitting victims of this\nmonster sweeping across the world; the\ninnocent children who are infected with,\naffected by or orphaned by HIV/Aids.\nOfficial UN projections indicate that a\ntotal of I3 million children will have lost\ntheir mother or both parents to Aids by the\nend of the year 2000. More than 10 million\nof them will still be under 15.\nAnd the worst is yet to come, according\nto Children Orphaned by Aids: Frontline\nresponses from eastern and southern\nAfrica.\nSays the publication, released on World\nAids Day (December I) by Unicef: \"The\nlives already claimed by the epidemic are\njust a fraction of those that lie ahead, in\nsub-Saharan Africa and many other countries\nof the world According to estimates\nby the joint United Nations Programme on\nHIV/Aids and the World Health Organisation,\n12.2 million women and 10.1 million\nmen will be living with HIV in sub-\nSaharan Africa at the end of 1999, with\ninfected women actually outnumbering\nmen \"\nNumbers have never been my forte.\nWords were always preferable, given their\npower to express emotions and capture the\ndramas of life more graphically. But, going\nby even the lowest of these figures-IO\nmillion-we are talking here about a massive\nnumber of children left to fend for\nthemselves in the liberalised world that we\nnow live in.\nThink hard about it. Watching someone\ndie slowly and painfully, watching them\nwaste away until they are just skin and\nbones and knowing there is nothing you\ncan ,do about it is the most devastating\nexperience anyone can go through.\nWhen the person dying is a child, you\nbegin questioning the fairness of life.\nImagine then what goes through the mind\nof an older child watching a parent literally\nfade away before their eyes.\nThe challenge before us is how to\ndevelop a practical, realistic way of dealing\nwith the crisis on our hands. Let us consider\nthe lifestyles of the groups categorised\nas high risk.\nLast week, we were told that the military\nburies at least two people a week due to\nAids. Teachers and long distance truck\ndrivers have been hit just as hard. The\ncommon strand here is that people in this\ncategory tend to work away from home for\nlong periods. '\nClearly, we need to find a way around\nlong distance marriages-which are quite common, especially in areas where the\nrates of migrant labour are high. It is like\nwaving temptation in the face of men and\nwomen separated by the demands of jobs.\nEven where families are living together,\nKenyans in the prime of their lives are\nbeing cut down by what popular myths of\nmanhood and womanhood--for want of a\nbetter description. There's this one about\nmen being polygamous by nature. What\nthis translates into in post-HIV Kenya is\nthat the majority of women literally have\nAids brought to them at home.\nCiting social pressures, men spend more\ntime in bars and nightclubs. Their _wives,\nin turn, take refuge in church.\nA psychologist friend swears that\nwomen undergoing stress in their marriages\ninevitably respond by seeking solace\nin their creator.\nIt's interesting how men and women\nview infidelity: Most men charged with\nkilling their wives invariably cite real or\nsuspected infidelity..\nBut a good African woman has few\noptions when it comes to handling the delicate\nmatter of infidelity.\nSeriously. Even when women know\ntheir husbands are unfaithful, they are\noften not in a position to negotiate safe\nsex-not even when they know their dearly\nbeloved have secretly \"inherited\" the widows\nof their cousins who died of Aids.\nThey cannot insist, for example, that their\npartners use condoms because that would\nbe interpreted two ways-it is either an\nadmission that they are aware of the shenanigans\ntheir husbands are up to or the)'\nare likely to raise the suspicion that they\nare playing an away game too.\nAnd a good woman, as defined by culture\nand religion, must be submissive to\nher man. We have been told by none other\nthan an archbishop that there is no such\nthing as a married woman saying no.\nTherefore, the whole question of marital\nrape is a figment of the imagination of\nthose rabid feminists!\nAnyone who seriously wants to tackle\nHIV/Aids must also consider the wider\nquestion of poverty. Poverty contributes to\nthe spread of Aids in different ways: First it drives women and girls into the streets.\nNew infections are growing at the fastest\nrate among girls aged 15-19.\nEven without the benefit of scientific\nresearch, the girls are not out there in the\ncold every night just for the fun of it.\nSome of those who operate on the streets of\nNairobi are still so young that you cannot\neven tell the difference between their legs\nand thighs or their bosoms and waists!\nBut, as one young woman put it: there is no\n.contest when you are faced with the choice\nof dying of hunger today and dying of Aids\n10 years down the road.\nOne of the most poignant images of the\nsuffering wreaked by Aids was that of the:\npoor women in a slum in Nairobi, who was\nbreast feeding her child during an interview\non KTN. Why do so when it will only\nexpose the child to infection? she was\nasked. Her response was that it was the\nonly thing she could feed her baby. In better\ntimes, she scrounges around for leftovers in bins and recycles them for her\nchildren. But this will not do for the infant\nThis woman is a single parent. It goes\nwithout saying that she is not in a position\nto buy the very expensive drugs that have\nbeen used to prolong the lives of those suffering\nfrom Aids.\nIn fact, there is a high chance that she\nwill not be 'able to fend off the opportunistic\ninfections that ravage the immune systems\nof Aids sufferers. If she cannot\nafford food, how can she possibly afford\nthe medicine to cure TB? And when she\nfinally goes, she will leave behind children\nwho will be reduced to yet more statistics\nin the toll that Aids has taken in this country.,\nPS: I got a call last week from a gentleman who 'works for the NSSF, He was rather distressed by my remarks about delays in paying widows. He assured me that NSSF pays it contributors their dues within one to two months.\nBut problems arise with survivors who are not contributors when there are complications,\nsuch as when there are multiple\nclaimants ,Or when the records are not in\norder. NSSF then has to thoroughly investigate\nthe matter and the process might take\ntime. I agreed with him that the task is not\nmade easier by the fact that NSSF deals\nwith 2.6 million accounts.\nWe can all help NSSF resolve such matters faster by ensuring that we have documents that regularise our marriages. We can also take advantage of the computerised statements to keep tabs on the state of\nour accounts."}
