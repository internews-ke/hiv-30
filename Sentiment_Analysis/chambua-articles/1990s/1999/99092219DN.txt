{"text": "MINISTRY OF HEALTH\nAGE AND SEX DISTRIBUTION OF HIV INFECTION\nSince most new infections are transmitted by heterosexual contact, people are at risk of catching\nthe infection as soon as they, become sexually active. The chart below shows the results Of a\nstudy in Kisumu (Kahindo et ai, 1997), which illustrates the proportion of the population that is\ninfected with HIV by age and sex. The pattern of infection is similar everywhere In Kenya.\nInfection levels are extremely high for girls and young women. The highest infection levels for\nwomen are in the 20-24 age group, while for men the highest infection levels are found In the\n30-39 age group. The same study found that 18 percent of women in Kisumu were infected within\ntwo years of becoming sexually active.\nA growing body of research suggests that high proportions of' Kenya's teenagers are sexually\nactive and their sexual behaviours put many of them at risk of HIV infection. The Kenya\nDemographic and Health Survey (KDHS, 1998) reports that the median age at first intercourse is\nabout 17 for women and men. Median age at first marriage is 19. for women and 25 for men.\nThus, there is a significant period of sexual activity before marriage that exposes young people to\nthe risk of HIV infection. \nNot all young people have sex because they want to. In a nation-wide study of 12-24 year-old\nwomen, one young woman in four said she lost her virginity because she had been forced to\nhave intercourse. In Nyanza, a quarter of secondary school boys and half of the girls described\ntheir first sexual experience as unpleasant or worse. unwilling sex With a infected partner carries\na high risk of infection, especially for girls, since if force is used abrasions and cuts are more\nlikely and the virus can more easily find its way into the bloodstream. What's more, condom use\nis unlikely in such situations.\n\nPrevalence of HIV in Kisumu, 1997\nA person does not develop AIDS as soon as he or she becomes infected with HIV. The interval\nbetween infection with HIV to onset of the disease, AIDS is between 3 and 10 years. During this\nincubation period the person may not have any symptoms and, therefore, may not be aware that\nhe or she is infected. This contributes to the spread of HIV, since the person can transmit the\ninfecti9n to others without realising it.\nHIV Incubation Period (Adults)\nFor children the incubation period is much shorter because their immune systems are not fully\ndeveloped. Most children who are infected at birth develop AIDS and die within five years.\nHIV Incubation Period (Infants)\nAge and sex Distribution of Reported AIDS Cases\nThe chart below shows the distribution of reported cases by age and sex since 1986. Each\nvertical bar shows the number of reported AIDS cases in a particular five-year age group.\nMales are shown on the left and females on the right.. ..... to be continued this Friday.\nIf you need the book, contact:\nHEAD, DIVISION OF AIDS and STD and TB\nNATION~L AIDS/STDS CONTROL BOARD '(NASCOP),\nP.
