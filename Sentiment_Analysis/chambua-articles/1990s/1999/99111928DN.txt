The immunisation cover\u2028\nage for children had also fallen, he said.\u2028\n\u201cWe know from the Government of\u2028\nKenya figures that by 1998, almost 14 per\u2028\ncent of the population aged between 14\u2028\nand 49 (was) HIV-positive . . (and) that\u2028\nabout 850,000 children have lost one or\u2028\nboth parents to HIV, he said.\u2028\nHe explained that many Kenyan hospitals lacked drugs and basic health care\u2028\ncommodities such as gloves and bandages, adding: \u201cMany public health facilities\u2028\nare under-budgeted, under-supplied and\u2028\nunder-staffed.\u201d\u2028\nHe expressed hope that the current\u2028\nhealth reform efforts would address the\u2028\nhealth problems facing Kenya, saying the\u2028\n10 hospitals selected to receive the equipment served large populations and that\u2028\nthey were \u201clikely to use the equipment\u2028\neffectively\u201d.\u2028\nSpeaking at the same function, Dr\u2028\nAnangwe said the donation \u201ccould not\u2028\nhave come at a better time . . . the hospitals are in dire need of the equipment.\u201d\u2028\nSome of the diseases the government\u2028\nhad hoped were under control had re\u2028\nemerged while new ones had arisen.\u2028\nWith decreasing resources, per capita\u2028\nincome had declined and the government\u2028\nhad cut back on resources allocated to the\u2028\nministry, he said.\u2028\nHe asked other donors to follow the\u2028\nexample of the US military to help re\u2028\nvamp the health sector, adding that currently. \u201cthe issue is not so much the avail\u2028\nability of drugs but the distribution to\u2028\nvarious regions\u201d. .\u2028\nThe ministry\u2019s principal focus, he said,\u2028\nwas the equitable allocation of resources\u2028\nto all Kenyan regions, increasing cost efficiency and government regulation.\u2028"}
