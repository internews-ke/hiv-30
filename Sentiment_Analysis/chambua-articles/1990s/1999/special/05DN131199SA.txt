Don in plea for disabled
By NATION Correspondents
Parliament should pass laws to guard against discrimination of disabled persons and those who are HIV positive, a former Vice -Chancellor has said.
Prof Joseph Mungai formally of Nairobi University,
said the laws should give equal job and educational
opportunities to all Kenyans.
The former VC said during a two-day workshop
organised by the Maendeleo Ya Wanawake Organisation
at Eldoret's Sirikwa Hotel that the laws should
target mainly people with hearing, sight and speech
impairments and those infected with Aids.
"The laws will ensure that those with matatus do
not deny the disabled transport and if they pass them,
they will be prosecuted ," he said.
The workshop which was officially opened by
Vice-President George Saitoti on Monday attracted
Maendeleo officials countrywide.
In Nyamira, another seminar was told that police
officers are more vulnerable to HIV/Aids since most
of them stay 'away from their spouses.
Addressing security officers attending the seminar,
Nyamira police boss Lawrence Rotich asked participants
to be cautious saying the epidemic had claimed
some of their colleagues.
