Government needs help to curb Aids, says official
By NATION Correspondent
Government efforts to eradicate
Aids will not succeed unless all
stakeholders are actively involved,
a health worker said yesterday.
The National Aids Control Pragram
me information officer, Mr Meshack Ndolo, said Aids was a
multi-sectoral problem.
Mr Ndolo expressed concern
over the results of a recent survey
in Kisumu District, which revealed
that young people aged between
15-19 were the most affected
and have a prevalence rate of 22 per cent. â€¢
He said it has been a challenge
for the National Aids Control
Programme to track trends in HIV/Aids infection.
He expressed doubt over the report from Nakuru that the prevalence
rate in the district had reduced from 37.5 to 24.9 percent.
Mr Ndolo said there was no evidence
that the rate of HIV infection
was reducing.
He was speaking when he met
the District lntersectoral Aids
Committee (DIAC) at the DC's
office in Kisumu.
