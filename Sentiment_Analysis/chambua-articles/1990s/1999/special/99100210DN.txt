{"text": "Bureaucracy leads.\nto Aids scandal\nBy ELAINE GANLEY\nPARIS, Thursday\nFrance's deep pride in its role as\na leader in Aids research has been\nshaken by revelations that highlevel\nauthorities deliberately delayed\nacting to protect hemophiliaes,  from contamination.\nAbout 1,200 French hemophiliacs, nearly half the total, are HIV positive, and 185 have died of Aids.\nA government-ordered report\nreleased on September 10 provides\na chronological account of\nhow hemophiliacs receiving blood\ntransfusions were sometimes given\nblood tainted with the HIV\nvirus, the precursor of Acquired\nImmune Deficiency Syndrome.\nAt one Paris blood bank, an\nAids victim gave blood 20 times\nbetween 1979 and 1984 according\nto the report. '\nThe report suggests negligence\nwas a factor. Major lapses included\nthe failure to test blood donors\nfor Aids as soon as an American test became available in March\n1985 and the failure to use a\nknown technique for neutralising\nthe HIV virus in blood stocks.\nThe report lays no specific\nblame, but makes clear that top\nmedical and government officials\nerred in their assessment of the\npotential dangers and delayed\nmaking decisions for financial\nand nationalistic reasons.\nIt \"bluntly reveals, for the first\ntime, the responsibility of the political powers\", said the respected\nnewspaper Le Monde. \"This drama\n... 'has reached the dimensions\nof' an affair of state.\" .\nFollowing lengthy negotiations,\nthe government established a\nfund in 1989 for hemophiliacs accidentally\ncontaminated. But the\n'French Association of Hemophiliacs\nsays legislators should pass a\nlaw providing for immediate indemnities,\nin light of the new\nrevelations.\nThe group also said it would join in. legal action instituted three years ago by non-hemophiliacs\nwho contracted the Aids virus\nduring blood transfusions.\nSuits have been filed for involuntary\nhomicide and poisoning, and\na criminal investigation is under\nway. Only three hemophiliacs\npreviously had filed suit.\nThe report was prepared by the\ninspector-general of social affairs,\nMichel Lucas. It has been submitted\nto Justice Minister Henri\nNallet and will be made available\nto a magistrate investigating the\ncase.\nThe report shows how authorities\nin 1985 disregarded near-certain\nknowledge that blood was a\nmajor carrier of the Aids virus.\nThey did not institute systematic\ntesting or the disease with an\nAmerican test available by March\n1985. They also did not take measures\nto \"inactivate\" the virus by\nheating blood products - a technique\nused in the United States\nand West Germany by 1983 but\nonly available on a limited basis 'in France.\nAn internal note, dated June\n26,1985, from the national centre\nfor blood transfusions advised\nthat distribution of non-heated\nblood products would remain the\nnormal procedure as long as the\nstock existed, according to the report,\nwhich underlines the cost\nfactor in changing methods.\nHeated products became obligatory\non October 1, 1985, while\nsystematic testing of blood donors\nfor the HIV virus went into\neffect on August 1.
