{"text": "Church should\nease off on sex\nI agree entirely that the Catholic\nChurch should tone down its crusade against the safe sex awareness compaign. However, I wish\nto congratulate the church for the\ncountless good things it has\nachieved in Kenya over the years.\nIt is only on the issue of safe\nsex, HIV and Aids that I believe\nthe Catholic Church has got it all\nwrong.\nWith the inevitability of changing\ntrends in morality, I think that\nthe church should rethink its approach\nto solving the threat posed\n- by Aids in our society. The\nChurch's hardline stance won't\nwork.\nHow do we expect the young\nuninformed people to cope with\nthe consequences of their\nbehaviour? We must provide\nthem with a safe alternative and\nthe church must-lead the way by\ntoning down its disapproval of the\nsafe sex campaign.\nGilbertus Oganga.\nSeattle. US."}
