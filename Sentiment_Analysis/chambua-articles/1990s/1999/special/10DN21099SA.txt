Bureaucracy leads.
to Aids scandal
By ELAINE GANLEY
PARIS, Thursday
France's deep pride in its role as
a leader in Aids research has been
shaken by revelations that highlevel
authorities deliberately delayed
acting to protect hemophiliaes,  from contamination.
About 1,200 French hemophiliacs, nearly half the total, are HIV positive, and 185 have died of Aids.
A government-ordered report
released on September 10 provides
a chronological account of
how hemophiliacs receiving blood
transfusions were sometimes given
blood tainted with the HIV
virus, the precursor of Acquired
Immune Deficiency Syndrome.
At one Paris blood bank, an
Aids victim gave blood 20 times
between 1979 and 1984 according
to the report. '
The report suggests negligence
was a factor. Major lapses included
the failure to test blood donors
for Aids as soon as an American test became available in March
1985 and the failure to use a
known technique for neutralising
the HIV virus in blood stocks.
The report lays no specific
blame, but makes clear that top
medical and government officials
erred in their assessment of the
potential dangers and delayed
making decisions for financial
and nationalistic reasons.
It "bluntly reveals, for the first
time, the responsibility of the political powers", said the respected
newspaper Le Monde. "This drama
... 'has reached the dimensions
of' an affair of state." .
Following lengthy negotiations,
the government established a
fund in 1989 for hemophiliacs accidentally
contaminated. But the
'French Association of Hemophiliacs
says legislators should pass a
law providing for immediate indemnities,
in light of the new
revelations.
The group also said it would join in. legal action instituted three years ago by non-hemophiliacs
who contracted the Aids virus
during blood transfusions.
Suits have been filed for involuntary
homicide and poisoning, and
a criminal investigation is under
way. Only three hemophiliacs
previously had filed suit.
The report was prepared by the
inspector-general of social affairs,
Michel Lucas. It has been submitted
to Justice Minister Henri
Nallet and will be made available
to a magistrate investigating the
case.
The report shows how authorities
in 1985 disregarded near-certain
knowledge that blood was a
major carrier of the Aids virus.
They did not institute systematic
testing or the disease with an
American test available by March
1985. They also did not take measures
to "inactivate" the virus by
heating blood products - a technique
used in the United States
and West Germany by 1983 but
only available on a limited basis 'in France.
An internal note, dated June
26,1985, from the national centre
for blood transfusions advised
that distribution of non-heated
blood products would remain the
normal procedure as long as the
stock existed, according to the report,
which underlines the cost
factor in changing methods.
Heated products became obligatory
on October 1, 1985, while
systematic testing of blood donors
for the HIV virus went into
effect on August 1. (AP)
