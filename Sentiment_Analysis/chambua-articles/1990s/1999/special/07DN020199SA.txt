Church should
ease off on sex
I agree entirely that the Catholic
Church should tone down its crusade against the safe sex awareness compaign. However, I wish
to congratulate the church for the
countless good things it has
achieved in Kenya over the years.
It is only on the issue of safe
sex, HIV and Aids that I believe
the Catholic Church has got it all
wrong.
With the inevitability of changing
trends in morality, I think that
the church should rethink its approach
to solving the threat posed
- by Aids in our society. The
Church's hardline stance won't
work.
How do we expect the young
uninformed people to cope with
the consequences of their
behaviour? We must provide
them with a safe alternative and
the church must-lead the way by
toning down its disapproval of the
safe sex campaign.
