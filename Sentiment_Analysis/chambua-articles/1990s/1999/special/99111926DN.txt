{"text": "FRIDAY NOVEMBER 19 1999\n\nMinistry OF HEALTH\nTHE NATIONAL AIDS AND STDS CONTROL PROGRAMME OF KENYA (NASCOP)\n\nThe Ministry 01 Health estimates that\n200, 000 Kenyans died of AIDS\nbetween 1984 and 1995. II AIDS\nprevention and control measures are\nnot pursed more aggressively and\nKenyans change their sexual behaviour_\nin order to reduce the number 01 new\ninfections, up to one million men,\nwomen and children may die 01 AIDS\nby the year 2000. In 1995, AIDS was\nreported to be the leading killer of men\nand women aged 15-39 years in\nsub-Saharan Africa. The incidence of\ndeaths due to AIDS is still increasing\nbecause 01 the existence 01 a large\npool 01 people with HIV infection. It is\nprojected that the number 01 deaths\ndue to AIDS among people aged 15-39\nyears in Kenya during the period\n1995-2000 may be three times the\nnumber 01 deaths due to all other\ndiseases combined. AIDS affects\ndevelopment and security.\nAIDS kills young economically\nproductive people, brings hardship to\nfamilies, increases expenditure on\nhealth care and adversely affects the\ncountry's development. By depriving\nthe economy 01 qualified and\nproductive labour force, restricting the\ntax base, and raising the demand lor\nsocial services due to the increased\nnumber of orphaned children, widows\nand the high cost of health care, AIDS\nposes a great challenge to Kenya's\ndevelopment. The loss of skilled\nuniformed officers has security\nimplications.\nIn order to overcome these challenges,\na strong political commitment at the\nhighest level, implementation 01 a\nmulti-sectoral AIDS prevention and\ncontrol strategy with priority locus on\nyoung people, mobilisation of\nresources for financing HIV prevention,\ncare and support, and establishment of\nNational AIDS Council to provide\nleadership at the highest level possible\nare critical.\nAIDS is a new disease. The first case\nwas reported in the United States 01\nAmerica in 1981. It is caused by\nHuman Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).\nHIV is. transmitted through sexual\ncontact, infected blood and from an\ninfected mother to a child. By the end\n01 June 1996, the World Health\nOrganisation estimated 28 million\npeople world-wide to have been\ninfected with HIV and 5 million dead\ndue to AIDS.\na) Establishment of National AIDS\nCommittee and the development\nExposure to infected blood occurs\nthrough transfusion of blood and blood\nproducts, injections, traditional surgical\npractices, and skin-piercing where\ninstruments are shared.\nIt is projected that by the year 2000, the\ncumulative number 01 people infected\nwill be 30-40 million. Ninety percent 01\nthese people win be in developing\ncountries. Analysis 01 HIV infections by\ngeographic\ndistribution reveals that the highest\nconcentration 01 the epidemic is in the\nsub- Saharan Africa accounting for\napproximately 70% of all HIV infections\nworld-wide. Kenya is one of the\ncountries in this region most affected\nby this epidemic. The main reasons \nthe rapid spread 01 AIDS in Africa are\nnot clearly understood. However,\nignorance, poverty, high incidence 01\nsexually transmitted diseases,\nsocio-cultural beliefs and practices, civil\nwar and deficient public health\ninfrastructure are the main factors.\nIn Kenya, AIDS was first recognised in\n1984. The number of new AIDS cases\nreported in one year has been on\naverage 12,000 since 1990. However,\ndue to under reporting, missed\ndiagnosis and delays in reporting,\nreported cases only represent the tip of\nthe iceberg. The valid estimate may be .\nthree times what is reported. Men and\nwomen are infected in equal\nproportions. 80% of the cases occur in\nthe age-group 15 to 49 years while\n10% are children under the age of 5\nyears. The epidemic is more advanced\nIn Nyanza, Western and parts of Rift\nValley provinces where IRV prevalence\nrates among pregnant women are 15%\nto 30%. It IS estimated that if current\ninfection rates continue, the number of\npeople infected will increase from 1.1\nmillion in 1995 to 1.7 million by the turn\nthe century. Sexual contact accounts\nfor up to 90% of AIDS cases in Kenya.\nHeterosexual contact is the main mode\nOf transmission. However, bisexual\ncontact has been reported in some\nparts of the country particularly Coast\nProvince, and among confined groups\nlike Prisoners. Homosexual contact has\nnot been reported in Kenya. Mother to child transmission is' growing in\nImportance because 01 the high HIV\ninfection rates among young women.\nThis mode 01 transmission together\nwith exposure to infected blood\naccounts for about 10-20% 01 AIDS\ncases in Kenya.\n1.1 Government response to AIDS\nWhen the first case 01 AIDS was\nrecognised in Kenya, the Government\nresponded by establishment of National AIDS\nCommittee and the development\nwas established in 1985 to advise\nthe Government on all matters\nrelated to the prevention and\ncontrol of AIDS. AIDS Programme\nSecretariat (APS) was\nestablished in the office of the\nDirector Medical Services to\nco-ordinate programme activities.\nThese steps led to the\nestablishment of Kenya National\nAIDS Control Programme in 1987\nwhich was then followed by the\ndevelopment  live year\nstrategic plan, Medium Term Plan\n(1987-91). This plan emphasised\ncreation of awareness about\nAIDS, blood safety, clinical\nmanagement of AIDS\nopportunistic infections and\ncapacity building for management\nof AIDS control programme at\nnational level. The main\nstrategies pursued were the\nprevention sexual transmission,\nprevention of transmission\nthrough blood, prevention 01\nmother to child transmission and\ndisease surveillance. Second\nMedium Term Plan (1992-96)\ncontinued to pursue the same\nstrategies but in addition\nemphasised the need to involve\nan sectors in HIV prevention in\norder to mobilise broader National\nresponse against the epidemic.\nThe new plan also emphasised\nthe need to provide care and\nsocial support to people inlected\nwith HIV, their families and\ncommunity; the need to reduce\nthe social and economic\nconsequences HIV/AIDS and\nthe strengthening national and\ndistrict capacity to respond to the\nepidemic.\nb) Recognition of AIDS as a\ndevelopment issue\nThis led to devoting a whole\nchapter on AIDS hi the Seventh\nNational Development Plan and\nthe Filth District Development\nPlans.\nc) Recognition of STD control as a\npriority intervention\nThe recognition that Sexually\nTransmitted Diseases facilitate\nthe spread of HIV led to\nintegration 01STD control into\nAIDS Control thus establishing\nNASCOP in 1992.\nd) Resource mobilisation\nThe Government received\nconsiderable support from\nmultilateral and bilateral donors in\nthe financing of AlDS control\nactivities during the first half the\nfirst MTP. However, it became\napparent to the Government that\nwhile the epidemic was getting\nworse, funding from donors was\nrapidly declining. In 1993, the\nGovernment approached the\nWorld Bank l a credit to help\nfinance HIV prevention and care.\nThe world Bank approved a\ncredit of US' 40 million from the\nInternational Development\nAssociation (IDA) in 1995 for\nSexually Transmitted Infections.\nThe Government appeals to\ndonor agencies for assistance\ntowards HIV prevention and care.\nThe annual requirement for HIV\nprevention alone is estimated to\nbe 40 million Kenya Pounds. This\nexcludes the cost of care. Cost\nbenefit analysis in Kenya has\nshown that for every shilling\ninvested in HIV prevention, there\nare thirty shillings net savings in\nbenefits. Effective resource\nmobilisation and use 0f these\nresources require that an\nappropriate policy framework be\nput in place to guide programme\nimplementation, particularly\nwhere many actors inCluding\nNon-Governmental\nOrganisations, Community Based\nOrganisations and the private .\nsector are involved. Hence the\npreparation of this paper.\n1.2 Major achievements\nEvaluation of the impact of interventions\na) High Level of awareness attained\nNational Survey in 1993 revealed\nthat 90% of men and women\n(15-49 years), were aware 01\nsexual transmission of AIDS\nirrespective of urban-rural\nresidence, level 01 education or\nprovince 01 residence. However,\nmisconceptions about the modes\nof transmission 01 HIV,\nparticularly mosquito bites and\nkissing, were very high(50% 01\nrespondents). There IS still need\nto intensify AIDS awareness\nparticularly among young. people\nand people living In rural areas\nSafe blood transfusion\nInfrastructure for screening of\nblood for HIV has been\nestablished. This includes the\navailability HIV blood\nscreening facilities in most district,\nprovincial, mission and private\nhospitals, supply 01 HIV testing\nreagents, maintenance of HIV\nscreening machines, training 01\nlaboratory personnel and\neducation 01 blood donors. This\nhas ensured that 98% 01 blood \ntransfusion is screened for HIV in\nKenya. However, the\nmaintenance 01 this infrastructure\nto make it responsive to the\nrapidly changing technology in\nHIV screening has put\nconsiderable strain on the\nNational AIDS Programme due to\nresource limitations. Kenya\nPounds 10 million is required\nyear to maintain an\neffective HIV blood screening\nprogramme.\nc) Advocacy\nThe National AIDS Programme\nhas been instrumental in\nadvocacy on critical issues\npertaining to law, ethics, culture,\nvulnerability of women, and youth\namong others. The programme\nhas developed partnerships with\nNGOs Community Based\nOrganisations and international\nagencies working in the area 01\nAIDS, human rights and\ndevelopment.\nd) HIV Surveillance\nSurveillance systems for\nmonitoring the trend 01HIV\nepidemic and AIDS cases is\nestablished. Kenya is one of the\nfew countries in the world with an\nelective HIV sentinel surveillance,\nAIDS case surveillance\nprogramme and reliable\nepidemiological database on\nAIDS. District capacity to\nimplement HIV prevention has\nbeen realised through the\nestablishment 01 District\nInter-sectoral AIDS co-ordinating\nCommittees which bring together\nrepresentatives 01 Government\ndepartments, NGOs and\nCommunity Based Organisations.\nThe Ministry of Health has since\n1995 decentralised AIDS\nactivities to the districts by issuing\nauthority to incur expenditure to\nDistrict Medical Ollicers lor AIDS\ncontrol.\nNGOs participation\nMany NGOs and Community\nBased Organisations are involved\nin HIV prevention and care\nactivities. A consortium ol         NGOs\nworking in HIV prevention and\ncare exists. been made in Kenya to control\nthe spread of HIV and to reduce\nthe impact ol AIDS on individuals,\nFamilies, communities and the\nNation as a whole, the epidemic\nremains powerful and dynamic,\nevolving with changing and\nunpredictable patterns in different\ncommunities. In communities\nwhere the epidemic is advanced\n.and appears to be levelling in the\ngeneral population, infection rates\nare increasing\\) among young\nwomen. Within these\ncommunities, a new epidemic 01\norphaned children and widows\nhas emerged.\nObjectives of Sessional Paper on AIDS\nThe aim 01 the Sessional Paper on AIDS\nis to provide a  policy framework within\nwhich AIDS prevention and control efforts\nwill be undertaken lor the next 15 years\nand beyond. Specifically:\nThe SPA will give direction on\nhow to handle controversial\nissues 6 while taking into account\nprevailing circumstances and the\nsocialcultural environment.\nlaboratory personnel and\neducation 01 blood donors. This\nhas ensured that 98% 01 blood lor\ntransfusion is screened for HIV in\nKenya. However, the\nmaintenance 01 this infrastructure\nto make it responsive to the\nrapidly changing technology in\nHIV screening has put\nconsiderable strain on the\nNational AIDS Programme due to\nresource limitations.

Their roles will be\nharmonised within the framework\n01 this SPA.\n\nbecause issues related to sexuality are\ntaboo, private and intimate.\n2.1 Economic Impact\nAIDS has significant effects on\ndemographic composition 01the\npopulation, and on social and economic\nstructures 01 the country. The disease has\nnegative effects on life expectancy, inlant\nmortality, adult mortality, and dependency\nratios. At the micro level, AIDS brings\nhardships to the family by reducing the\ncapacity to cam income. It adversely\naffects health care expenditures as well as\nthe overall development 01 the country at\nmacro-economic level. Thus, AIDS has\nadverse economic repercussions given its\nnegative impact on population trends,\nlabour productivity and overall social costs.\n2.2. Morbidity and mortality\nMost Kenyans with HIV infection look\nhealthy and have no symptoms. This is\ndue to the long incubation period of AIDS.\nBecause up to 80% 01 people infected are\nin the age-group 15-49 years, effective\nlabour force lor the country is threatened.\nThe number 01 deaths arising from fix\nblown AIDS remains a small proportion of\nthe HIV positive population but is growing\nsteadily. It is estimated that whereas\n16,000 people died 01 the disease by 1989,\nand 200,000 by 1995, the cumulative figure\nis projected to increase to 1 million by the\nyear 2000.\nThe economic consequences of increasing\ndeaths particularly in the rural areas will be\nthe deprivation ol the agricultural sector\nprofits required labour force, noting that 74%\nof Kenya's labour force is engaged in small\nscale farming.\nIncreasing deaths due to AIDS results in\nhigher child and adult dependency ratios,\nwhich imply greater demand for health and\neducation services. More single parents\nespecially mothers and AIDS orphans win\nraise the demand for social selVices.\nBecause it is the duty 01 the Government to\nprovide these social services, the\nimplications of this will be the diversion 01\ninvestment funds to meet the increased\ndemands for social services. In addition,\nthe country will have a restricted tax base\nthus reducing the Government's ability to\nmeet the demand lor social services.\n2.3 Costs to the economy\nThe direct and indirect costs ol treating\nAIDS patients can be quantified. Direct\ncosts include the cost 01 drugs, laboratory\ntests, radiology and hospital overhead\ncosts. Indirect costs involve the average\nproductive -years lost. Surveys\u2019 in Kenya\nindicate that a productive person can be\ndefined to be one aged between 15 and 65\nyears. An adult therefore has 50 years\navailable for work. On average, a Kenyan\nis employed lor 36 years. Combining\nproductive life-years lost with the age 01\nthose who develop AIDS, each new AIDS\ncase results in a total loss 0122 years 01\nproductive life. The average direct cost per\nnew AIDS case IS estimated to be Kshs.\n34.680 assuming that  55 per cent 01 AIDS\npatients receive hospital treatment plus an\nestimated Indirect cost of Kshs. 538,560 in\nlost wages. This gives the combined cost\nol AIDS to be Kshs. 573,240 These costs\nare very high lor a young economy like that\nof Kenya.\nIn order lor the Government to meet the\ncosts of treating AIDS and related diseases\nit must adopt a strategy of partnership with\nthe private sector, NGOs, donor agencies\nand the community in health care\nfinancing. Education programmes through\nthe clergy, politicians, provincial\nadministration and community leaders to\ncreate awareness among Kenyans in order\nto curb further spread of AIDS is a priority\n2.4 Social and cultural challenges\nHeterosexual relations are primarily\ndetermined by psychological and\nsocial-cultural factors. It IS important to\nunderstand the dynamics underlying these\nfactors as they can facilitate and also\nprevent HIV transmission. Sexual instinct is\ntriggered by both internal and external\ninfluences. Psycho-sexual development\ntriggered by both internal and external\ninfluences. Psycho-sexual development\nand socialization 01 norms and values\nwithin the family or community and the\ninherent social organization are important\ninstruments in the regulation of sexual\nbehaviour. Control of sexual behaviour is\nchallenging because sex is a private\nactivity used by individuals and\ncommunities to fulfil specific functions.\nThere is a fairly high degree 01 awareness\nabout AIDS among Kenyans. However,\nthis level of awareness has not been\nmatched by comparable behaviour change\nmainly due to diverse social-cultural, and\npersonal factors which are inherent in\nsociety and among people. Focus should\nbe made on specific cultural practices that\npromote positive behaviour and discourage\nnegative practices. Efforts must be made\nto promote socialcultural norms, values,\nbeliefs and enacted laws that centre\naround marriage and procreation in order\nto regulate heterosexual behaviour.\nConsensus between religious teachings on\nsexuality and the social-cultural practices\nmust be harmonized through education,\nare expected to provide role models to'\nenhance selective attachment with\nindividuals who have positive influence on\nyoung people's psychosocial\ndevelopment.\nPeer influence plays a significant part in\ndetermining the level 01 involvement In\nrisk practices. In a more traditional society\nthe group may have strong social beliefs\nwhich are common to all members, and\nthis is reinforced through peer grouping.\nPeer education lor groups with deviant\nbehaviour will be used to address\nproblems related to adult and adolescent\ndepression, social pressure, eariy sexual\nexposure and experiences which may\nlead to hi\\)h risk behaviour like '\ncommercial sex, bisexuality and drug\nabuse which in turn make an individual\nvulnerable to HIV infection. The cultural\ndiversity that exists in Kenyan\ncommunities negates uniformity in the'\napplication of mechanisms that would help\nto regulate sexual behaviour.\nFurthermore, the norms, values and\nsocial-cultural identity are being eroded\nby western influence. No new acceptable\nsocial order has been created to replace\nthe old one. Therefore, community\ncounselling will be encouraged in order to\nrevisit customary law which guided\nmarriage, premarital and extramarital sex,\nseparation, divorce and remarriage as a\nstrategy to minimise e deviant sexual\nbehaviour.\n2.5 Orphaned children\nOrphans are a social burden. Those\ninfected have a double dilemma because\nAIDS is a stigmatized disease. Social\nattitude to orphans From single mothers is\neven more negative because traditional\npractice scorns such children thereby\ndenying them property rights. Advocacy\non the rights 01 such children will be\nintensified. Communities will be\npersuaded to take responsibility, as\npractised in the traditional sense to care\nand support these children including\nthose infected with HIV.\n2.6 Cultural Issues\nThe diversity in social-cultural ideologies\nconstitute the diverse and peculiar\nelements 01 sexual practices inherent in\nKenyan societies. Cultural beliefs anlj\npractices were useful in maintaining\nbiological continuity, socialization 01\nyoung people, maintaining 01 law and\norder, defining the meaning of \nproducing and distributing goods and\nservices.  These practices also provided\nthe capacity lor societies to cope with .\ncalamities such as draught and disease\noutbreaks. With the advent 01 AIDS, $some\nthese beliefs and practices require\nre-examination because they promote\nbehaviours which put individuals at risk 01\ncontracting or transmitting HIV. These$\ninclude the different types 01\nlike polygamy. woman to woman\nmarriage. reunion. polyandrous,\nhypodermic. leveret (widow Inherit;;.nee)\nendogamous and exogamous\nrelationships. Non sexual cultural practices\nand rites such as circumcision\npiercing, ritual bathing ol the dead,\nand tattooing, if done h\ncontaminated instruments could pose a\ngreat danger to practitioners as well as to\ntheir clients. Efforts will be made to\nidentify and document traditional norms.\nbeliefs and practices that may promote\nHIV transmission,\nSociety will be made to understand the\nrelationship between these practice$ and\nHIV transmission. Community involvement\nhi identifying possible solutions will ~e\nundertaken. Advocacy on virtues that\nlessen the risk 01 Infection and promote\ncollective responsibility in the care \nrehabilitation of the infected and the\naffected will be intensified taking into\naccount that changes in cultural practice\ntake a very long time because they \ndeeply rooted in society The Government\nrecognizes the important role the\nsocial-cultural factors play in transmission\nand containment 01 HIV.\n2.7 Legal and ethical challenges\nThe Government of Kenya has responded\nto the problem 01 HIV and AIDS by\nincluding a chapter on AIDS in the 7th\nNational Development Plan and the 5th\nedition 01 District Development Plan and\nhas developed various manuals and\nPolicy Guidelines on the control and\nmanagement 01 HIV/AIDS. However, no\nspecific legal standards have been'\ndeveloped to address the problem.\nAlthough there is no specific statute\ndealing with AIDS In Kenya, \nexisting statutes have provisions\nwhich are ol direct relevance to the\nmanagement o AIDS epidemic. Otf.er\nlegal positions can be inferred \nexpected customary law and cultural\npractices. The issues emanating Ir(lm\nthese legal positions include\nHuman rights: All forms 01 discrimination\nagainst people with AIDS will be outlawed\nas enshrined in the Constitution. '\n\nthese legal positions include:\nTesting from HIV: Testing lor HIV will be\nvoluntary with informed consent except\nlor authorized research where the\nprotocol has been approved by the'\nNational AIDS Committee.\nat risk of infection alter the individual\nhas been provided enough opportunity\nto disclose his EW status to those\nconcerned.\nMedical ethics: The existing ethical\npractices will continue to be applicable\nin the handling AIDS and HIV infection.\nIn the interest 01the public an people\ndiagnosed with HIV infection must be\ninformed ol their status and be\nencouraged to take precaution for\nthemselves and those with whom they\nare likely to get into sexual relations.\nEmployer-employee rights: The\nemployer does not have to know the\nHIV status 01their employees without\nthe consent 01the employee.\nResearch: Co-ordination ol research is\ncurrently being handled by different\ndepartments of Government without\nlegal authority A legal body' with a .\nclearly defined mandate Will be\nestablished to co-ordinate\nAIDS/HIV/STDs and related research.\nReligion and culture: Because ol the\ndiversity of the Kenyan culture and\nreligion, written law and ethics will be\napplied within the context 01 specific\ncommunities. Research on these\nissues will be undertaken to shed more\nlight on what is involved in each\ncommunity. Religious and cultural\npractices and utterances which\nundermine HIV/AIDS control measures\nwill be censured for public good.\nCriminal sane/ions: Criminal sanctions\nagainst people who deliberately and\nirresponsibly infect others with MV will\nbe upheld.\nChildren affected by AIDS: Children\ninfected and affected by HIV/AIIDS will\nbe protected from exploitation and\ndiscrimination using existing laws.\nInsurance: The Government will work\nclosely with insurance companies to\nestablish guidelines pertaining to\npolicies and benefits for people affected\nor infected with HIV.\nBoth medical and legal ethics provide a\nbasis lor the protection \nrights 01 persons affected by HIV/AIDS.\nProvisions governing medical ethics in\nKenya are found in the codes of\nprofessional conduct and discipline.\nThe major ethical concerns relate to\ntraining, confidentiality,\nprofessional judgement and the\nguarantee 0 safety ol health care\nproviders.\n2.8 Religion and culture\nKenya consists of many religious\ncommunities, and each 01thern has\ncertain rules and norms, which form\npart ol the regulating mechanisms in\nsocially ethnic community has its\ntraditional customs and laws. Some\ncommunities have common cultural\npractices and these practices have\nimplications for the spread of I-HV\nThese norms are relevant to the social\nbehaviour related to the transmission\nand spread 01 HIV/AIDS . Most\nreligions have a stand on the issues of\npremarital and extramarital sex,\nabortion, contraceptives and polygamy\nIn keeping With their beliefs. These ln\nturn have a bearing on the\nmanagement of the HIV/AIDS\nepidemic. Many ol the legal and ethical\nprovisions, and religious and cultural\npositions reveal various social\ndilemmas which need careful thought\nand serious attention in any attempt to\nresolve them in the formulation of\npolicies and the management and\ncontrol of HIV/AiDS.\n2.9 Health care\nThe rapid increase in the number of\nreported cases of AIDS and people\nwith HIV Infection presents a significant\nchallenge to the existing health care\nsystem The potential to over-stretch\nexisting resources lor health care\ndelivery exists.\nProvision 01 health care remains a big\nchallenge to the Government.\nShortage 0 drugs and patient care\nsupplies, inadequate diagnostic\ncapabilities at various levels including\nblood screening equipment and their\nmaintenance. overcrowding in the\nhealth facilities, irregular supply 01\ntesting reagents, and high turnover of\nqualified health personnel making\ncontinuity impossible are indications 01\nserious strain on the health sector. HIV\nhas caused a major resurgence 01\nTuberculosis which presents a major\npublic health problem particularly wit\nthe emergence 01 drug resistant I\n01 Tubercle bacilli. The cost 01\ntreatment Is too high. Drugs for\ntreatment of HIV infection co\naverage 700,000 Kenya S\nperson per year. Drugs I\nmanagement of\nare also very expensive."}
