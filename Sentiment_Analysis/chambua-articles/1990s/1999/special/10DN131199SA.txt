Pakistan to remain in the cold

DURBAN (South Africa), Friday
Incoming Commonwealth Secretary
General Don McKinnon
confirmed the organisation's
suspension of Pakistan here
today, but he added that it would
maintain the "technical cooperation"
necessary to bring the
country back to democracy.
"There is no question about
the suspension from the councils
of the Commonwealth. That
was certainly re-determined
today," Mr McKinnon told a
press conference after being
unanimously elected by a Heads
of Government Meeting here.
"The issue is now, how can
the Commonwealth best act
through the ministerial action
group to bring Pakistan back,"
he said, referring to the organisation's
democratic watchdog,
the Commonwealth Ministerial
Action Group (CMAG).
"Clearly we are not taking
away the kind of technical
cooperation that may be necessary
to help that democratic
process be returned," said Mr
McKinnon, New Zealand's foreign
minister.
Meanwhile, British Prime
Minister Tony Blair, warning
that the spread of Aids in Africa
will affect Britain too if it is not
halted, pledged 22.7 million
pounds to help fight the disease.
Mr Blair, speaking to journalists
at the summit said there
was a very great danger that
because Aids in Britain was
under control, the growth of the
problem in the developing world
would be forgotten.
"There are some nine countries
in Africa now where life
expectancy has come down from
the 60s to the 40s," he said.
"There are literally millions
of people, including children
and now increasingly women,
with the Aids virus. And if we
don't tackle this problem in a
really concerted way it's going
to grow - it's going to keep
. back the development of all
these nations and in the end it
will affect us as well."
Mr Blair was speaking after
reading a report on the spread of
Aids and HIV, prepared by his
officials, which he said had
shocked him.
He said Commonwealth governments
had to show leadership
in tackling the Aids crisis.
Mr Blair planned to tell the
summit later that Britain would
inject 14 million pounds into a
US-led research effort to find a
vaccine for Aids to be used in
developing countries.
