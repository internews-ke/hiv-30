Report on Aids spread released
UNITED NATIONs. Thursday
The number of people in eastern
Europe infected with HIV, the
_virus that causes Aids, increased
nine-fold in just three years from
fewer than 30,000 to an estimated
270,000 by the end of 1998, the
United Nations reported today.
"Approximately 80 percent of
infections are in individuals who
inject drugs," said Mr Peter Piot,
director of the UN joint programme
on HIV/Aids.
Mr Piot is due to make the opening
speech to the ninth international
conference on people living,
with HIV/Aids in Warsaw on
Friday.
"In the region, Ukraine has been
the most dramatically affected
and Belarus, Moldova,' Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation
also have growing HIV
epidemics."
But, he said, "Condom manufacturers
have reported that Poland is
now the largest market, for condoms
in eastern Europe -- an
indication of how many people
have adopted safer behaviour."
