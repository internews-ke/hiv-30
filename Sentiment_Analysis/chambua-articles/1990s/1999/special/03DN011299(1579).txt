Uganda Aids infection rate ‘has declined’

BY Nation Correspondent in Kampala 
Uganda’s rate of HIV/AIDS 
infection has considerably 
declined over the past five years 
from 28 per cent to 14 per cent, 
according to the Ministry of 
Health. 
The reduction in the rates has

been attributed to the open government 

policy, sex education, 
awareness campaigns, increased 
use of condoms, general behavioral

change and the late 
engagement in sex by both girls 
and boys. 
The current trends show progressive 

declines of at least 50

per Cent in urban areas and 30 per 
cent in rural areas. The challenge, 
however, remains despite these 
rates of reduction in HIV/AIDS 
infections. ‘Although there is an increased 
advocacy for the use of condoms, 
some church leaders remain
opposed to it. 
Increased campaigns against 
the dangers of HIV/AIDS has 
also resulted in fewer men going 
for casual sex. 
On the contrary, prostitution 
has been on the rise and campaigns 

are targeted at sex workers 
in urban areas as well.
