The challenge,\u2028\nhowever, remains despite these\u2028\nrates of reduction in HIV/AIDS\u2028\ninfections. \u2018Although there is an increased\u2028\nadvocacy for the use of condoms,\u2028\nsome church leaders remain\nopposed to it.\u2028\nIncreased campaigns against\u2028\nthe dangers of HIV/AIDS has\u2028\nalso resulted in fewer men going\u2028\nfor casual sex.\u2028\nOn the contrary, prostitution\u2028\nhas been on the rise and campaigns \n\nare targeted at sex workers\u2028\nin urban areas as well."}
