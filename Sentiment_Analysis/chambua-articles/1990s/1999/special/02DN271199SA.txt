Move on Aids long
Overdue Gatabaki
The declaration of Aids as a
national disaster should have
come earlier, Githunguri MP
Njehu Gatabaki said yesterday .â€¢
He said it was evil for the government
to wait until more than a
million Kenyans had died.
He gave an example of Uganda
which, he said, formulated policies
in the late 1980s and- early
1990s and arrested the spread of
the scourge. Mr Gatabaki also
wondered when Kenyans would
stop involving themselves in what
he described as reckless and casual
sex. He was contributing to a paper
presented by the permanent secretary
for Health, Prof Julius Meme
on social and economic implication
of Aids in Kenya. Prof
Meme said there was need to put
in place necessary laws to protect
the rights of all those infected
with HIV so that they might not
be discriminated against. An
idea floated by Dr Odongo
Oman1o that students be screened
was rejected by some MPs. Mr
Kiraitu Murungi argued that the
move will provoke protests from
human rights activists.
