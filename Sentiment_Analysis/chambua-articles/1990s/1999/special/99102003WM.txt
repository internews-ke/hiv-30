{"text": "Why circumcision cannot be wished away\nConcerns have been expressed regarding\nthe hygienic conditions\nunder which circumcision is carried\nout.\nIndeed, the inevitable infections\nwhich occur during traditional\ncircumcision are themselves\nfertile ground for the\ntransmission of the HIV virus.\nOur aids against Aids lie\nin training traditional\ncircumcisers in hygienic procedures. In communities where circumcision\nhas been part of preparation\nfor marriage and family life, it has\nbeen performed at puberty for\nmany centuries to signal the end\nof childhood and the beginning of\nadolescence and readiness to start\nassuming adult social responsibilities.\nIn some communities, circumcision\nis performed with other activities\nfor marriage preparation.\nFurthermore, circumcision is\nvalued by the communities that\npracticed it.\nOne of the reasons why it has\nbeen difficult to eradicate female\ncircumcision is because the fight\nagainst it has been medical and religious,\nand this has not taken into\nconsideration the deeply-held cultural\nvalues attached to it.\nThe condemnation has led to\nstrong reaction, making the practice more entrenched and\ncontinues secretly.\nIn such situations, those condemning\ncircumcision have failed\nto recognise that these operations\nare performed as a puberty rite to\nsymbolise specific marriage preparation\nactivities.\nThe adolescent girls are thereby\nmade physically and psychologically\naware of having changed at\npuberty from childhood to adolescence\nand young adulthood and\ninstructed on how to behave in\nmarriage.\nSimilarly, the young man will\nalso have been initiated and culturally\nprogrammed to look out  for these behaviour and physical\nchanges. For such a strongly entrenched\ncustom, the question\ntherefore remains as to what can\nreplace it and with as much appeal\nin stabilising the bond between a\nmarried couple. To abolish the custom, it will be\nnecessary to develop alternative\nprogrammes which are consistent\nwith modern education and lifestyles\nand whose basis is appealing\nto the people who are involved\nin the change. The role of religious education\nand social ethics in our school system\nshould be to propagate these\nideals.\nOur aids against Aids lie\nin enabling parents at\nhome and teachers in\nschools to impart knowledge\nand values to guide\nsexual maturation\nTraditionally, reproductive functions\nhave had the highly 'cherished\nvalue of the survival of society.\nThis is one of the reasons why\ncultural activities that accompany\ncircumcision have such strongly held\nreligious significance. This is one of the reasons why\nvarious attempts to stop the practice have been resisted as it is seen as a threat to the social fabric\nof the community which practises it.\nThere are, however, four problems which may be associated with the spread of Aids through circumcision:\nThe problem of unhygienic conditions under which the operation is carried out;\nThe circumcised males and females take their new status as a license for engaging in promiscuous\nsexual activities;\nThe circumcision period is accompanied\nby excessive drinking\nof alcohol which leads to drunkenness\nand irresponsible sexual\nbehaviour;\nThe actual lessons which have\nbeen given to the young people\nand symbolised physically by circumcision are no longer being given effectively. This is because\nthe parents and the community assume that they are being given through formal education.\nOur aids against Aids lie in ensuring that the real\nlessons on adolescent development, courtship\nand marriage are given effectively whether\nthere is circumcision or\nnot.\nPandemic rises among women\nNEW YORK. Wednesday\nThe Aids pandemic in the developing world\nhas spread dramatically among women and\ngirls, the United Nations Children's Fund has\nsaid.\n\"What was once a predominantly male\ndisease has become a heterosexually spread\npandemic which is now consigning tens of\nmillions of girls and women to a cruel, slow\ndeath due to Aids\" Unisef Executive Director Carol Bellamy said in a statement. \nAccording to Unisef statistics, women and girls now account for 43 per cent of the estimated\n33 million people worldwide living\nwith HIV/Aids.\nIn Brazil, in 1984, only one woman was\nHIV-positive for every 99 men infected with\nthe virus. Today. women account for one fourth\nof all those infected with HIV.\nIn Africa, the risk for girls aged 15-24 is\ntwo to one, compared with boys. In sub-Saharan\nAfrica, infected women outnumber\nmen six to five.\nIn Western Kenya, almost one in four girls between 15 and 19 is living with HIV, compared\nto only one in 25 youths in the same age\ngroup. In Zambia, 16 times as many girls are\ninfected as boys.\nMs Bellamy said the spread of HIV/Aids\namong women is being helped by an atmosphere\nof pervasive gender-based discrimination,\nand cannot be divorced from sexual coercion\nand the fact that between 16 and 52 per\ncent of all women worldwide suffer abuse\nfrom an intimate partner at least once in their\nlives.
