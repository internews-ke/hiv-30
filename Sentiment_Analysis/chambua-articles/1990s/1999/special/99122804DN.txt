{"text": "Ex-Soviet nuclear base home to drug addicts\nKHMELNITSKY (Ukraine),\n. Monday\nDrug addicts tending pigs and\nchickens at a top secret Soviet nuclear\nmissile base - the very idea\nwould have had Cold War generals\npacking their bags for Siberia ..\nYet that pastoral scene has become\na reality at the former base\nof the Red Army's Fifth Strategic\nMissile Regiment, hidden away\namong the hills and barren fields\nof western Ukraine.\nSoviet troops pulled out from\nKhmelnitsky after the Union collapsed\nin 1991. Now only a crumbling\nconcrete obelisk screaming\n\"Glory to the Soviet Strategic\nMissile Forces!\" stands as a reminder\nthat\u00b7 here nuclear apocalypse\nwas once just the touch of a\nbutton away.\nA nearby silo housing one of\n176 intercontinental ballistic missiles\noriginally stationed in\nUkraine was blown up early last\nyear in line with the United States-\nSoviet START arms reduction\ntreaty. Ukraine has handed. over\nall its rockets to Russia.\nBut despite the Soviet military\nretreat, well-worn khaki uniforms\nare still much in evidence at\nKhmelnitsky. They are regulation\nissue for the 15 or so hardened\ndrug addicts undergoing a rehabilitation\ncourse at the base.\nAnd like the soldiers who once\npaced their lives to the shrill sirens\nof nuclear alerts, they perform\ntheir daily chores at a rhythm set\nby a gong hammered by the three\nmen in charge, the \"masters\",\nwho are themselves reformed\naddicts.\n\"Our method is a combination\nof work therapy and psychological\ncorrection,\" said Mr Anatoly\nFedoruk, 35, one of the masters\nwho spent 18 years of his \"former\"\nlife on drugs.\nHe believes that the rigorous\norder established on the former\nbase and daily labour can heal the\naddicts.\n\"The effect of labour is such\nthat a person changes and starts\nthinking in a new way,\" he said.\n\u2022'Our patients just have no time to\nthink about narcotics.\"\nIn line with a programme designed\nby the Khmelnitsky regional\nauthorities in January last\nyear in an attempt to save the lives of at least some of the thousands\nof locally registered drug addicts,\na group of enthusiasts was allowed\nto open the rehabilitation\ncentre. They called it \"Viktoria\".\nStrict discipline reigns. All patients\nmust sign a pledge to abstain\nfrom drugs, alcohol and sex,\nto be honest and not to leave the\nterritory of the base.\nAs in the army, orders are orders,\ninsubordination is never discussed\nand the lonely base, 20 km\nfrom the nearest village, seems an\nideal location for the camp.\nEvery morning, each patient is\ngiven work orders for the day.\nDaily chores range from tending\npigs and chickens at a former military\nstorehouse to repairing barracks\nleft in a mess after the last\nSoviet soldiers retreated a few\nyears ago.\n. 'Only by going through a.\ncentre like this can you become\nhuman again,\" said 30-year-old\nNatasha, who once ran a bookshop.\nViktoria is her third attempt at quitting drugs.'\n. Ms Larisa Vysotska, director of\nthe centre, said around 1,500 drug\naddicts are officially registered in\nthe Khmelnitsky region, while the\nnumber of those not reflected in\nofficial statistics may be 10 times\nhigher.\nThere are no official statistics\nfor Ukraine as a whole, where the\n50 million population includes a\ngrowing army of desperate young\npeople seeking refuge from hardship\nin drugs,\nMs Vysotska said centres similar to Viktoria would be opened in\nseveral other western regions, as well as in the capital Kiev, ill\nOdessa on the Black Sea and in\nDonetsk region in the east.\nBut she said the planned new\ncentres were unlikely to be able to\ncope with the growing ranks Of\ndrug addicts. '\n\"We understand we canngt\nhelp everyone. But if we only save\na few lives, our efforts won't be\nwasted,\" she said. Ms Vysotska said she had managed\nto save her own son, who\nused to take drugs, through a similar\ncentre in neighbouring Poland.\nMr Fedoruk said that turning\nformer addicts into educators was.\na key to success. \"A lot of people\nthink a junkie can't quit. But we\nprove here that this is possible,\nthat drug addicts can be the same\nas every other human being,\" he\nsaid.\nNatasha, who also carries the\nHIV virus which leads to Aids as a\nresult of sharing an infected needle,\nhas been at the centre for 10\nmonths and her term will be end in\ntwo. She would like to help the\nothers to escape addiction when\nher own treatment is over.\n\"Drug addiction is a horrible\ndisease, incurable for many, but I\nwant to help people to break free\nof that nightmare,\". she said. \"I\nwould like to become an educator,\na master. I was given help. and\n.now I would like to help the others\n...
