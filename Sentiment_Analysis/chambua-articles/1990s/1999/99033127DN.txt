{"text": "MARCH 31,1999\nKenyans need to take \u2028\nAids/HIV more seriously \u2028\nBy JULIUS BOSIRE \u2028\nKenyans seem to have conspired \u2028\nnot to talk about HIV/Aids in a \u2028\ncountry where the adult HIV prevalence is Over 10 per cent. \u2028\nAt least this was the message \u2028\nt out to all Kenyans from a \u2028\nseminar organised by the United \u2028\nNations Children's Fund (Unicef) \u2028\nheld in Nyeri last week. \u2028\nIt has been observed that reluctance by adult Kenyans to change \u2028\nsexual behaviour are clear manifestations of the limitations inherent in Information Education and \u2028\nCommunication (IEC) campaigns \u2028\ncreated solely to raise awareness. \u2028\nAdditional factors considered \u2028\nas inhibiting behaviour change, \u2028\ndespite Kenyans' awareness of \u2028\nthe risk of HIV/Aids, include economic, cultural factors, lifestyle \u2028\nand migration patterns. \u2028\n\"Since Kenya is a nation with a \u2028\ndiversity of ethnic groups, there \u2028\nare many sexual and cultural practices and beliefs which influence \u2028\nthe spread Of HIV. The continuance Of the practices and the persistence of the beliefs have contributed to high risk behaviour as \u2028\nwell as misconceptions about the \u2028\nmodes of transmission and posstble means of protection.\" a Unicef \u2028\nreport says \u2028\nLack of freely available HIV/Aids information written in \u2028\nsimple and direct language is an- \u2028\nother bottleneck to curbing the \u2028\nspread. Those materials readily \u2028\navailable are full of medical vocabulary. \u2028\nA report prepared by Unicef \u2028\nand the government presented at \u2028\nthe seminar read in part: \"With \u2028\nAids as a major contributor to the \u2028\nrise in adult mortality in Kenya \u2028\nfrom nine per 1,000 in 1980 to 13 \u2028\nper 1,000 in 1998, an exponential \u2028\nrise in the numbers Of children orphaned as a result of the epidemic \u2028\nIS expected. Currently estimated \u2028\nas numbering 600,000, the figure \u2028\nfor orphaned children is projected \u2028\nto one million by 2005. \" \u2028\nThis conspiracy has its repercussions - people will forget the \u2028\nscourge exists and indulge in activities that will spread it further. \u2028\nUnicef country representative, \u2028\nMamadou Bagayoko, said that \u2028\nRwanda talked about Aids and by \u2028\nso doing the Rwandese population \u2028\nhas helped contain the disease. \u2028\nNyeri DC Ali Korane remarked: \"Our people have bent \u2028\ntowards politics so much. politicians can not talk about the health \u2028\nOf their people. The language we \u2028\nseem to understand most is politics, While our people are Succumbing to death through \u2028\nHIV/Aids.\" \u2028\nIn his statement, Dr Bagayoko's said: \"The information, education and communication interventions which have been introduced to alert the general public to \u2028\nthe reality of the risk of HIV/Aids \u2028\nhave been faced with many obstacles. These have been attributed to \u2028\na lack Of support from the leadership structures at various levels \u2028\nwithin the country, and to the failure by those implementing interventions to secure the participation of stakeholders and target \u2028\ngroups.
