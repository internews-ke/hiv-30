{"text": "Doctors must dwell on issues\nI am a Kenya Medical Association\nmember and I read with\ninterest a letter by the association's\nnational treasurer, Dr A. 1.\nO. Were (DN, December 8).\nKMA is an organisation of\nprofessionals in the medical\nfield. HIV/Aids therefore falls\ndirectly under its ambit. Dr\nWere's letter appears to focus on\nattacking the Catholic Church\nrather than soberly guiding the\ndebate into areas where KMA\ncan help fight this scourge.\nWhy would a professional\norganisation waste time at this\ncrucial hour castigating a religious\norganisation rather than\ndealing with pertinent issues to\nhelp Kenyans?\nI have, of late, raised real\nmedical and scientific issues in\nthe Press, and one would hope\nKMA would factually disprove\nthese issues regarding condom\nuse for HIV prevention: Issues\nlike the very high failure rates of\nup to 3 per cent when condoms are used for contraception and the\nsurmise that the failure rates\nwould be over 50 per cent for\nHIV/Aids transmission.\nOther issues include the fact\nthat condoms burst during use,\nthat there is spillage of seminal\nfluid in 100 per cent of users, that\nall condoms have holes, that they\nslip off, that storage and transportation\nin Africa destroys them,\nthat oil-based lubricants damage\nthem, that the quality of condoms\nis poor in Africa including Kenya,\nand that improper usage is\nrampant.\nThese are either very serious\nissues. Other social and advocacy\ngroups may have a knowledge\ngap, but not so KMA.\nDr Were is entitled to his\nviews. Trouble starts when he\npurports to speak on behalf of all\nKMA members and ends up\nattacking religious groups while\navoiding the real issues.\nDr Stephen K. Karanja.\nNairobi."}
