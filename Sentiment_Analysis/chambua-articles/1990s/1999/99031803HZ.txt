Wednesday\nHeart disease is set to become the serial\nkiller of the early 21 st century in\nsub-Saharan Africa unless research\ngathers pace, a top South African researcher\nhas said.\n\"Heart disease is the serious killer\nof the future,\" Prof. Lionel Opie. Director\nof the Cape Heart Centre. has\nsaid.\n\"In the year 2020, the major cause\nof disability and death in sub-Saharan\nAfrica will be heart disease.\" Prof\nOpie added as the centre opened a section\nto conduct research into tricking\nthe heart into regrowing damaged\nvalves.\nProf Opie said Aids made all the\nheadlines at present but deaths from\nthe killer disease would eventually decline\nas prevention began to work and\nvaccines became available.\nThis would mean that attention\nwould focus again on cardio-vascular\ndiseases. he said.\nOpie said people would live longer\nand, in developing countries in particular,\nwould adopt previously unaffordable\nunhealthy eating habits and\nlifestyles.\nHe noted that the problem was by no\nmeans restricted to Africa.\n\"We believe our work will benefit\nSouth Africa ... and the world:\" he\nsaid.\nThe aim of the centre, a stone's\nthrow from the hospital where Christiaan\nBarnard performed the world's\nfirst human heart transplant in 1967, is\nto create a multi-skilled team of specialists\nto study heart diseases in all\ntheir forms.\nThe latest boost came in the form of\na $4.84 million (Sh290.4 million) investment\nfrom the leading US medical\ntechnology firm Medtronic Incorporated.\nThe centre has used this money to\nset up the valve regrowth research\nproject.\n\"The idea is to create an implant\nthat eventually consists of the patient's\nown tissue,\" said project leader Prof\nPeter Zilla.\nHe said the technology was aimed\nspecifically at Third World countries\nbut would have major uses in developed\neconomies as well.\nIn rich countries, replacement heart\nvalves were made out of titanium metal\nwhich would not break or wear out\nbut which required the patients to take carefully measured doses of blood\nanti-coagulant for the rest of their\nlives.\nThis was neither affordable nor possible\nin poor rural areas in developing\ncountries, where medical science had\nturned to heart valves cut from pigs.\nHowever, these valves wore out after seven years or so and had to be replaced\ninvolving dangerous open\nheart surgery each time.\nThe new implant, already being\nused in replacing clogged arteries, is a\ntype of plastic that is not rejected by\nthe body, does not cause damaging inflammation\nand along which the\nbody's own cells will slowly grow.\nProf. Zilla reckoned. his project\ncould start producing results within the\nfirst decade of the new millennium.\nAmong Afrikaners, there was a one\nin 60 incidences of heart-disease related\nto cholesterol, while among the\nJewish. Lebanese and Asian populations.\nit was about one in 100.\n\"Many of the immigrant communities\ninto this country brought severe\nmetabolic problems with them,\" he\nsaid. \"They have come from a very\nsmall gene pool. ..\nProf. Marais said 'the normal incidence\nof cholesterol-related heart disease\nin the rest of the world was about\none in 500.\nHe added that the genetic defect\namong South Africans was compounded\nby stress, high blood pressure and\nunhealthy living and eating habits.\nBut he accepted that even if the genetic\ndisorders were corrected and the\nlifestyles perfected. there would still\nbe instances where surgical intervention\nwould be necessary. which was\nwhere the new research department\ncame into its own.\nDrilling tiny holes into the heart is a\nsafe and effective way of casing chest\npain, US researchers have said\nThe new approach lets blood reach\nareas of the heart starved for oxygen by\nblocked arteries although doctors still\nare not quite sure how it works.\nNormally, the procedure. known as\ntransmyocardial revascularisation requires\nopen-heart surgery. But Dr Stephen\nOesterle of Massachusetts General\nHospital in Boston and colleagues\ntested a less invasive method which\nuses a catheter to get the laser inside\nthe chest.\nThe new technology, developed by\nSunnyvale. California based CardioGenesis Corporation, is called\npercutaneous myocardial revascularisation.\n\"We set out several years ago\nto challenge the necessity of. doing\nopen-heart surgery on these\npatients,\" Oesterle said in a\nstatement.\n\"We felt that we could actually\nget at the damaged heart muscle\nfrom inside the heart using a percutaneous.\ncatheter-based system\nand an optical fibre to deliver laser\nenergy.\u00b7\u00b7\nFor the study, 221 patients with\nClass III or IV angina. or chest\npain, that had not been treatable\nby angioplasty or bypass surgery.\nwere given either drugs or drugs\nplus the myocardial revascularisation.\n(Reuters)"}
