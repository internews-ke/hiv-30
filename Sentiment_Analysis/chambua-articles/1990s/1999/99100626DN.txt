{"text": "WEDNESDAY OCTOBER 6 1999\n\nMINISTRY OF HEALTH\nNATIONAL AIDS/STDS CONTROL PROGRAMME (NASCOP)\nIV. INTERVENTIONS TO SLOW SPREAD OF AIDS .... contInued\u2028\n Safe blood supply. To avoid infection through blood transfusion the blood supply needs to be made as safe as\npossible. This means screening blood through laboratory tests and screening potential blood donors through\ninterviews in order to reject as donors those that have a high probability of been infected. Unnecessary blood\ntransfusions should be discouraged and autologous transfusions for planned surgery should be encouraged. The\nSessional Paper No. 4 of 1997 on AIDS in Kfmya establishes a policy of improving blood transfusion services\nthrough improved procedures and quality control to ensure a safe supply of blood for necessary transfusions.\nCombined Interventions. Each of the intervention packages described above can make an important contribution to\ncontrolling the spread of HIV. Alone, none is likely to solve the problem completely; some people will respond to or\nbe affected by one type of interventions while others will respond to or be affected by another. Computer simulations\nsuggest that a much larger effect gan be achieved by implementing all the interventions together in a broad attack on\nthe epidemic. ' ' ..\nThe following information is not specific to Kenya, but is based on simulation modelling. It shows the expected\nimpact of interventions in an illustrative African city. In the absence of interventions - the base projection or the top\nline on the graph\" the HIV adult prevalence rate continues to rise over time. An effective blood screening\nprogramme\u00b7 represented by the second line from the top - reduces prevalence only modestly. However, an effective\nSTD control programme brings expected prevalence down by about 12 per cent, and condom promotion and partner\nreduction interventions HIV -prevalence even more. Most importantly, when all four interventions are\nimplemented simultaneously; the projected prevalence is nearly 55 percent less in 2005 than it would have~ been in\nthe absence of interventions: ' .\nThe fundamental message is a hopeful one. The, simulation modelling suggests that with a concerted effort on a\nnumber of fronts, a the rising \nprevalence curve downwards and start to bring the HIV/AIDS epidemic\nunder control. . \" ' ..\nOverall, there are several important lessons to be learned concerning interventions.\n\nPilot tests have shown that Interventions can be successful in significantly reducing the spread of HIV.\nApplying interventions on a large scale is costly and success is difficult to measure. Nonetheless, there is now\nevidence from Uganda and Thailand that significant reductions in HIV incidence and prevalence can occur at a national\nlevel. Both countries recognised the seriousness of the epidemic early and implemented strong national programmes\nto reduce the spread of HIV and to provide support for people with AIDS and their families.\nIt is important to intervene as early as possible with a comprehensive mix of proven and effective interventions to reach\nthe largest possible number of people and have the maximum impact ..\n\u2022 The most effective interventions are those that focus on population groups that have the most sexual partners. This IS\ntrue at all stages of the epidemic. ' \"\n\u2022 Prevention through behaviour change, cOndOm promotion and STD treatment is many times more cost-effective than\neither providing hospital treatment for AIDS patients or trying to prevent the spread of the virus with anti-retroviral\n-therapy. ,\"\nTreatment and Vaccines .\nTreatments. Highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HMRT) has received much international publicity in recent years. HMRT\nuses combinations of drugs and can inhibit the spread of HIV within a person's body. For some HIV-infected persons,\nHMRT has been an effective way to prevent the onset of AIDS and prolong life. However, several considerations need to\nbe taken into account when considering HMRT in the context of developing countries such as Kenya. Most importantly;\n\u2022 Many HIV -infected persons cannot tolerate th!! side effects of the drugs and for them the combination therapy\ntreatments are not helpful. Only about ha\"-of prospective ~can.'t tolerate the therapy.\n\u2022 The drugs have 10 be taken under the strictest conditions, including day and with meals or on an empty\nstomach . .Even small variations from the. prescribed pattern can render the treatment ineffective. Patients also need\nconstant access to sophisticated medical laboratories to track viral counts in the body ..... ' .,.....\nMost importantly, the costs of these treatments are prohibitively high, around $8,000 per patient per year in an actual\ndeveloping country setting and even more in the industrialised countries.\nThe new combination drugs are important in that .for the first time a medical treatment has proven effective against HIV.\nThis creates hope for the future. But for the moment, even in the most developed countries, this is a highly expensive\nexperiment with an unknown outcome affecting a minority of HIV-infected individuals ...\nIt is possible to treat, for a time, many of the opportunistic infections that develop because of the weakened immune\nsystem. These treatments can Improve the quality of life and delay the death of a person with AIDS.\nAs the numbers of people living with HIV/AIDS has increased, a need for evaluatinlil simple therapeutic interventions has\nbecome apparent. There is preliminary data from African studies that prophylaxis with Septrin significantly decreases the\nfrequency of bacterial infections and hospital admission for immunosupressed individuals. likewise 6 months prophylaxis\nwith Isoniazid among HIV infected patients who are PPI) positive significantly reduces the incidence of .tuberculosis in this\npopulation of patients. There is a need to integrate these and other research findings in the ongoing care of HIV infected\nindividuals.\n\nVaccines. For many HIV/AIDS researchers and policymakers, the real hope is for a widely available vaccine that can\nprevent HIV infection in the first place. Research on vaccines continues in many laboratories around the world, with more\nthan two dozen experimental HIV vaccines currently being tested. Most scientists believe that vaccines are not likely to be\nready for mass use for at least the next five to 10 years.\nIn conclusion, it does not appear that either drugs or vaccines will contribute much to reducing the sexual spread of HIV in\nKenya in the next several years.\n\nSigns of Success\nMuch has been done in Kenya in the last 15 years to fight the AIDS epidemic. Through the Sessional Paper on AIDS in\nKenya the government has established a dear policy framework. The National AIDS and STD Control Programme has\norganized the government response including disseminating information about the epidemic, coordinating research,\nensuring safe medical practices, and implementing intervention and treatment programs. A large number of\nnon-governmental organisations (NGOs) provide prevention, counselling and care services. Organisations from all parts of\nsociety are participating, including church and community groups and the commercial sector. Political, commercial and.\ncommunity leaders are beginning to speak out about AIDS and encourage people to protect themselves .\u2022\nIn spite of these activities, HIV prevalence is continuing to rise in Kenya. However, that does not mean that these efforts\nare having no effect. Without these efforts the epidemic would be far worse than it is today. In addition, there are signs that\nprograms are having an important effect in reducing the risk of HIV transmission.\n\nCondom use. The number of condoms distributed by the government has increased from 18 million in 1991 to over 70\nmillion in 1998. Sales of condoms through the social marketing program have increased to over 10 million per year.\nThe 1998 KDHS reports-that over 40 percent of men report using a condom the last time they had sex with someone\nother than their spouse. It is clear that more and more people are recognizing the risk of unprotected sex and are\ntaking steps to protect themselves and their partners. ' '\nSTD treatment. A number of programs have been implemented around the country to improve the treatment of\nsexually transmitted diseases. The Ministry of Health reports that over 50,000 cases of STDs are being treated each\nmonth. This is a significant increase from just a few years ago when supplies of drugs to treat STDs were scarce.\n\u2022 Targeted intervention programs. Two comprehensive intervention programs in Nairobi have shown that the\ntreatment of STDs, promotion of condoms and peer counselling can have an important effect, Interventions with\ncommercial sex workers in one area of Nairobi led to a reduction in the annual incidence of new HIV infections among\nthe sex workers from 45 percent in the late 1980s to 10 percent in the 1990s. Large declines in the prevalence of STDs\nhave also occurred.\nCommunity-based programs. A community-based intervention in Nairobi and Nakuru included peer group education,\ncondom promotion and improved STDs treatment. From 1993 to 1998 there have been significant decline\nin the\nprevalence of chancroid and gonorrhea and a decline in HIV prevalence among the young women\n\nSigns of success have also been seen in other countries, particularly Thailand and Uganda, where programs have apparently\nbeen successful in reducing the prevalence of HIV infection. Recent trends in Uganda are a sign of hope for other countries\nwith high levels of HIV infection, Reports from sentinel surveillance sites and other sources in Uganda indicate that there may\nactually be a downward trend in HIV prevalence. Of particular note, the evidence indicates that HIV incidence (annual new\ninfections) and prevalence rates among 15-19 year olds in that country have levelled off in rural areas and are declining in\nurban areas. Survey results from the early 1990s and mid-1990s in Uganda suggests that behaviour has been changing within\nthis age group, most notably by a later onset of sexual activity among teens and a decline in the proportion of adolescents with\nmultiple sex partners. There has also been greater use of condoms in high-risk sexual encounters by members of this age\ngroup.\nThe reasons for the behavioural changes in Uganda are unclear. Some data indicate that people are likely to change their\nbehaviour if a close friend or relative dies from the disease. This suggests rising mortality as a grim catalyst for changing\nsexual practices. More positively, Ugandan leaders have given strong support to AIDS control efforts, and knowledge about\nAIDS, its risks and consequences, and means of prevention have been widely diffused through out the country. Whatever the\nreasons for the changing behaviour, it is encouraging to' witness, at last, a downward trend In HIV prevalence in an African\ncountry seriously affected by the AIDS epidemic.\nNational Policy ,\nIn order to meet the challenge of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, the Government of Kenya recognized the need to establish clear\npolicy guidelines and effective organizational structures. As a result, it began in 1996 to develop a national HIV/AIDS policy.\nNine technical sub-committees were established to organize expert information and draft sections of the policy. The\nrecommendations of these committees were presented in meetings held throughout the country to solicit suggestions from all\nparts of society and gain consensus on the most appropriate policies.\nThis work resulted in a draft national policy that was submitted to Parliament. It was approved on September 24,1997 as\nSessional Paper No.4 of 1997 on \"AIDS in Kenya\". The approval of the Sessional Paper signals the clear intention of the\nGovernment to support effective programs to control the spread of AIDS, to protect the human rights of those with HIV and\nAIDS and to provide care for those infected and affected by HIV/AIDS.\nThe goal of the Sessional Paper on AIDS is \"to provide a policy framework within which AIDS prevention and control efforts\nfor the next 15 years and beyond.\" The specific objectives are:\na) Give direction on how to handle controversial issues while taking into account prevailing circumstances and the\nsocial-cultural environment. .\nb) Enable the government to play its leadership role in AIDS prevention and control activities. Challenges posed by\nAIDS call for a multi-sectoral approach thus bringing a diversity of actors together. Their roles will be harmonized\nwithin the framework of the Sessional Paper on AIDS.\nc) Recommend an appropriate institutional framework for effective management and coordination of HIV/AIDS\nprogramme activities.\nThe Sessional Paper recognizes that responding effectively to the AIDS crisis will require \"a strong political commitment at the\nhighest level, implementation of a multi-sectoral prevention and control strategy with priority focus on young people,\nmobilisation of resources for financing HIV prevention, care and support, and establishment 01 National AIDS Counci to\nprovide leadership at the highest level possible.'\n\nThe Sessional Paper reviews the challenges posed by the AIDS epidemic and describes the strategies and interventions that\nthe government has adopted. It also presents a policy framework for AIDS prevention and care. Some of the key aspects ot\nthis framework are:\n\nParticipation. All sectors of society are invited to join the effort against AIDS. This specifically includes the private\nsector, NGOs, donor agencies, communities, provincial and! district administration officials, religious communities,\neducational institutions and parents.' .\nSocio-cultural issues. Efforts must be made that promote socio-cultural norms, values and beliefs that will help to\nreduce the risk of HIV transmission. Consensus between the religious teachings on sexuality and the social and\ncultural practices must be harmonized through education, advocacy, counselling, persuasion and the enforcement of\nboth customary and written law.\nLegal and ethical challenges. Discrimination against individuals with HIV or AIDS violates their human rights and\nhampers prevention efforts by discouraging people from learning about their HIV status. A key element of the\nSessional Paper is the guarantee that the human rights of all Kenyans will be respected. Among the provisions are:\n\u2022 Human rights. All forms of discrimination against people with AIDS should be outlawed.\nTesting for HIV. HIV testing for individuals should be voluntary.\nConfidentiality. Ethical codes regarding confidentiality of AIDS status should be enforced.\nEmployer-employee rights. The employer does not have the right to know the HIV status of an employee without the\n- consent of the employee.\nResearch. A legal body with a clearly defined mandate will be established to co-ordinate HIV/AIDS/STD) research.\nChildren. Children infected and affected by HIV/AIDS will be protected from exploitation and discrimination using\nexisting laws. '\nInsurance. The Government will work closely with insurance companies to establish guidelines pertaining to policies\nand benefits for people affected or infected with HIV. The guidelines will ensure that compensation is available to all\nthose who were not infected prior to the issuance of their insurance policy.\nCounselling. Codes for counselling will be developed that will take into account the need for voluntary testing and\nconfidentiality.\nDrugs. Clear legal provisions will regulate drug trials and provide sanctions against those peddling, cutting up for sale\nand advertising substances which have no proven curative value against HIV.\n\u2022 Criminal sanctions. Criminal sanctions will be upheld against all those who deliberately infect others.\n\u2022 Women and men. HIV infects everyone. Men may be influenced into high risk behaviour by cultural norms\nconcerning labour migration. alcohol use. plural marriages and other aspects of social behaviour. Women are\nespecially vulnerable to HIV infection due to a variety of social and biological factors. The Government will work with\ncommunity agencies to provide support for activities that reduce the risk of HIV infection, such as basic education on\nhuman sexuality, HIV and STDs; activities for youth that may delay the onset of sexual activity; harmonising the age\nof consent, marriage and maturity to 18 years; encouraging voluntary testing; empowering women on matters\npertaining to access to information and economic and social recognition.\nChildren. In order to protect children the Government will develop clear guidelines on breastfeeding, vaccination,\ntreatment of pregnant women who are HIV positive, and case and support for HIV orphans. These guidelines will be\nbased on the latest national and international research results.\" ,\n\u2022 Youth and young adults. A large percentage of new HIV infections occur among youth. To protect young people\nagainst HIV and STD infections, the Government will provide direction in designing culturally, morally and\nscientifically acceptable AIDS education programs for youth in and out of school and advocate for the protection of\nyouth against anti-social behaviours that put them at risk.\n\nSince AIDS affects all part of society, it is important to have a multi-sectoral strategy to confront the epidemic. Therefore, the\nSessional Paper on AIDS calls for the establishment of a National AIDS Council (NAC). The NAC will playa major role in\norganizing the response to the AIDS epidemic. Specifically, it will\n\u2022 Develop and articulate policies and strategies '\nTake the lead in advocacy and public relations for the AIDS control programme\nMobilize resources for AIDS control and provide funding to implementing agencies\nCo-ordinate and supervise the implementation of a multi-sectoral programme Mobilize government agencies, NGOs,\nresearch bodies and universities to participate in AIDS control\n\u2022 Collaborate with local and international agencies that work in AIDS control.\nThe Sessional Paper on AIDS establishes the basis for an effective, multi-sectoral response to the\nAIDS epidemic. The challenge now is to translate these guidelines into successful plans, programmes and action"}
