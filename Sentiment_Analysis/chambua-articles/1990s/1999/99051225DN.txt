{"text": "WEDNESDAY MAY 12 1999\n\nWe are not statistics\n\nRecently, Charlene Smith, a\nS. African journalist was raped and left tied up. By telling her story, she puts a face to the thousands of women and children raped around the world\u2028\nEvery26 seconds in South\nAfrica a woman gets\u2019s raped. It was my turn one.\nThursday night recently\nBefore I began writing this I took AZT, 3TC and Crixia - they are anti-retroviral drugs. they will hopefully help lessen the potential of my getting Aids from the rapist, assuming, of course, that he is HIV-positive. In a country where 1,800 people contract\nHIV every day, it's a gamble I refuse to take. But the difficulties I encountered in getting the drug and the treatment I received from medical staff at private hospitals and the district surgeon's office are an indictment against health care policies and the medical profession.\nI need to take these drugs for a month; within two weeks they will be making me feel very ill and depressed. The therapy will cost me about R400. I am a freelance journalist with medical aid for hospitalisation only, and not this.\nWith the three anti-retroviral drugs I am also on antibiotics in case the rapist had a sexually transmittable disease aside from\nHlV/Aids. The district surgeon, a quiet Congolese who admitted she as to go for therapy because she\ncannot cope with what she sees, also got me \"morning after\" tablets\nbecause I was raped while I was ovulating. She gave me yet another 12 drugs I had to take simultaneously.\nI don't know what they were for. I need drugs to sleep and tranquillisers for those times when I become very fearful or tearful.\nA general practitioner gave me Valoid to stop nausea and vomiting.\nSince the rape I frequently feel nauseous, my stomach aches from where he pushed me. But also I feel as though I have something terrible in my stomach that I have to get rid of. I wish someone could scrape out my insides.\nWhen I told a male friend about the incident I began vomiting. In two weeks time I will need the Valoid because the anti-retroviral drugs by that time, according to a doctor, will give me constant nausea.\nThis is about the rape: I came home at 8.30 pm. I had met with a\nFrench television crew I had given some assistance to. I was tired.\nMy three dogs acted as normal, I opened the door, walked in and locked it again. I noticed there were more lights on than I had left on. An expensive mustard-coloured leather jacket with sheepskin lining that I had bought in Argentina was in. the middle of the floor. I thought my son had come home needing a warm jacket and had, for inexplicable reasons, left a jacket on the lounge floor. I went to his room and noted he lights were on instead of just\nis lamp. I left them.\nI went into my room, put my bag, car keys and cell phone on a chair next to the telephone and went to the toilet kicking off my shoes as I went. As I stood next to the toilet to flush he was there. He stood briefly on the doorway as if wanting me to admire him in the jacket. I began screaming. He walked toward me holding an elaborate silver Argentine gaucho's knife that was usually among display paintings in the lounge, and said, \"Keep quiet, I have a knife.\"\nI obeyed. He pushed me out of the bathroom holding the knife close to me. \"Where is the money'?\"\n\"I don't have any,\" I said,\n\"I am poor.\"\nHe looked in my bag. I had R10 he was furious and threw it on the floor. \"Is this all'?\" \"Yes,\" I said. Where was my ATM card'? I gave it to him. \"Give me the number, and don't lie.\" I did as he said. \"I can take you there in the car,\" I said (I just wanted to get out of the house).\n\"No,\" he said. He grabbed me\nby my arms, which days later still\nache. Is anyone coming here'?\n\"Yes,\" I said. \"When?\" I thought, if l tell him soon he might panic. \"In an hour or two,\" Is it\nyour husband'? \"Yes.\" He asked,\n\"Where is your son.\" \"He is sleeping at friends tonight.\"\n\"Don't move, I'm going to tie\nyou up.\" He opened my cupboard.\nHe's going to bind me with scarves or stockings, I thought.\nBut this was a man who had prepared while waiting for my return\n- thick masking tape normally kept in a kitchen cupboard was\nwaiting in the bedroom cupboard.\nHe tied my hands behind my back, making tape go round my wrists\nand hands.\n\"First,\" he said, \"we are going to have sex.\" He was a tall man, about 2 metres, good-looking not very dark skin, the pale tones of a\nXhosa or Tswana, with a thin moustache. His eyes had a slightly almond shape. He had a thin gold sleeper earring in his left ear. He wore a good quality, long-sleeve, green polo-neck-type shirt and an expensive pair of brown corduroys.\nHe took of my slacks and underwear,\nand undid his pants.\nA week before the incident on a Saturday at about noon, the phone rang. I picked it up,\na man with a deep voice said,\n\"Hello Mrs smith, what are\nyou doing?\" I queried: \"Who am I speaking to?\" He said,\n\"Aaron,\" I asked, \"Can I help you?\" He said, \"I've been watching you a long time, I love you. \"I put the phone down. His voice troubled me. I phoned the Parkview police and spoke to a sergeant on duty who said there was nothing they could do. If I wanted I could get Telkom to tape my phone. We went out and on our return the same man had left a message on the answering machine. \"If you don't want to\nspeak to me I will f ..you.\"\nHe pushed me on to the bed. I remembered reading of a woman who told a would-be rapist she \nhad Aids and he left her alone. I tried the same thing. He said, \"I'll wear a condom.\" He did not. He could not get a full erection. I was very dry making full penetration difficult. He began swearing. He has to stay in control, I thought. I\nsoothed, \"It's not your fault, it's the Aids, it does this.\" \"How old are you'?\" he asked. I lied and said\nI was considerably older. It occurred to me that he knew menopausal women could be dry. A friend disagrees. She believes he\nthought older white women are less likely to be HIV-positive.\nI lay there and thought, be calm,\nbe calm. He finished and did up\nhis pants. Now I'm going to get\nthe money, but I will only be 15 minutes. Don\u2019t do anything foolish or I will kill you. He wound the tape around my eyes and head. \u201cDon\u2019t put the tape over my nose or I won\u2019t be able to breathe,\u201d I said. He wound it over my mouth and head and bound my ankles and knees. Throughout I spoke in a calm voice.\nHe put me on the floor I realissed I must look like a victim. I was crouching head down. Infact my position was not of submission but of intense concentration. Listening to and analysing every sound. \"I'm going, I will be only 15 minutes.\"\nHe closed the door, but did not lock it. This told me he would not leave the house immediately. I\nheard him lifting the lids of Chinese urns in the lounge. He was still looking for money-but he Ieft my Iaptop computer on the bed where he raped me, a radio on a living-room couch, a brand-new mountain bike, and antique earrings in my ears.\nHe took off my watch but dropped it on the floor. His real motive was not robbery, although he also took a Chinese silk rug from my bedroom floor, leaving behind an Indian dhurrie. He has expensive tastes. I instinctively feel these are trophies for him, he will not try to sell them. He is not your normal petty thief/rapist. He speaks well. he has had a decent education. he as clean. He planned this all so carefully.\nHe comes back into the bathroom.\n\"Where are the front door keys'!\" I can't speak so I indicate with my bound hands. \"You' arc not tied up well enough.\" He comes back and applies layers more masking tape to my hands and wrists.\nHe slides a latch across the bathroom door.\nI wait  a while in case he returns to check on me and then I struggle\nto free myself. I am not a person of much physical strength; I get men\nto open the lids on jars or tins. The first victory is when the\nties around my ankles break free and then my \"knees. I can\u2019t see which of our two bathrooms I am in, but I guess. I flounder around with my eyes hound; I have to get my hands free. It is unbelievably hard.\nAt one point I stop, I'm exhausted, I'm terrified, and I feel like giving up. But I think if you give up, he will come back and kill you. Finally I get one hand free. I push the tape over my eyes up and that over my mouth down. I can't get my other hand free; it is bound not only to my back but in some strange way to my jacket. I ignore it and begin kicking the door. I\nrealise I don't have the strength to smash it. I open the window and begin tugging at the burglar bars;\nI'll never pull them out.\nI begin screaming, \"Help me, please somebody help me.\" I have a quiet voice and even when\nI raise it, it s not very loud. He has put me in the middle bathroom furthest from neighbours. It is also the beginning of a long weekend, my neighbours may have gone away. Not even dogs bark when I shout. No one seems to hear.\nI kick the door some more. \"Please God, let me live, \" I pray under my breath. The lights are off but I feel for something in the bathroom cupboard to break the window, perhaps that sound will carry further than my voice, The first few containers I use have no impact, and then I take one that makes the glass break; I keep smashing the glass out of the frame.\nTURN"}
