{"text": "WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1999\n\nAids: Blazing a trail of devastation\ne, CLAY MUGANDA\u2028\n Rose Ujbima\u2019s husband passed\u2028away when her sick twins were\nsix months old ..\nAfter numerous tests, one of\nthe daughters tested HIV positive,\nprompting the mother to\ngo for a test which confirmed she\nwas also HIV-positive ..\nRose, who is currently a counsellor\nwith the Association of\nPeople With Aids in Kenya, lost\none of the daughters before the\ngirl's first birthday. More children\nhave been orphaned by Aids\nin Africa than anywhere~ else. The\ndeep-rooted African kinship system\nof extended families that has\nprovided a safety net for such\nchildren is now breaking down\nunder the strain of Aids and soaring\nnumbers of orphans in affected\ncountries.\nAs the 20th century draws to a\nclose, some 33.6 million men,\nwomen and children are threatened\nby the Aids scourge.\nAccording to the Joint United\nNation Programme on HIV/Aids\n(Unaids) and the World Health\nOrganisation (WHO), 32.4 million\nadults and 1.2 million children\nwill be living with HIV by\n. the end of this year.\nFor some years, it has been\nclear that sub-Saharan Africa is .\nthe world's worst affected region.\nInfection levels are highest,\naccess to care is lowest and social\nand .economic safety nets that\nmight help families cope with the\nepidemic are badly lackitig.\nAt the start of the 21st century,\nsome 23.3 million Africans south\nof the Sahara are estimated by\nUnaids and WHO to have\nHIV/Aids. In other words, 70 per\ncent of the world's total in an area\nthat has 10 per cent of the world's\npopulation.\nAs prevention efforts elsewhere\nreduce the number of those infected\nby HIV, the number of children\ngetting infected rises.\nUnaids and WHO estimates\nthat nearly 90 per cent of the\n500,000 children born with the\nvirus or infected through breastfeeding\nin 1999 were living in\nsub-Saharan Africa.\nRecently, 15 studies of HIV prevalence\nin the general population\nconducted in both rural and\nurban areas in nine African countries\nsuggest that ante-natal estimates\ntend to underestimate the real\nlevel of HIV infection in\nwomen ..\nThis is because infected women\nprogressively become less fertile:\nThe longer their HIV infection\nincreases, the less likely they\nare to get pregnant.\n. And since many HIV-positive\nwomen are no longer becoming\npregnant, they are not showing up\nat ante-natal clinics where blood\nsamples for anonymous HIV testing\nare taken.\nThus, the ante-natal estimates\nfail to reflect the true extent of\nHIV infection among the female\npopulation. However,\npopulation-based studies suggest\nthat infection levels in men are\nlower than the levels of HIV recorded\namong pregnant women.\nThere are, therefore, significantly\nmore women than men living\nwith HIV/Aids in sub-Saharan\nAfrica. On average, the studies\nshow that between 12 and I3 African\nwomen are infected for every\n10 men, while Unaids and\nWHO estimate that by the end of\nthis year, 12.2 million women and\n10.1 million men aged between\n15 and 49 years will be living\nwith HIV/Aids in the region. -\nCurrently, 55 per cent of the\n23.3 million people living with\nHIV/Aids in sub-Saharan Africa\nare women.\nMore women than men ate infected\ndue to a combination of\nfactors, including the fact that\nHIV passes more easily from men\nto women through sex than the\nother way round.\nHowever, a prime factor is the\ndifference in age patterns of HIV\ninfection in both sexes. Women\ntend to get infected at far younger\nages than men because of cultural\nand biological reasons.\nRecent studies in several Afri--\ncan countries show that girls aged\nbetween 15 and 19 are six times\nmore likely to be HIV-positive\nthan boys of the same age.\nEventually, the infection rate in\nmen catches up when they are in\ntheir early 30s or late twenties.\nOlder men - who often coerce\ngirls into sex or buy them gifts -\nare the main source of HIV for\nteenage girls.\nEven as sub-Saharan Africa\ncontinues to bear the brunt of\nhigh HIV infection, it is probably\nthe only region where infections\n, are .largely due to heterosexual\nencounters.\nIn some other parts of the\nworld, drug-injecting behaviour\ncarries a high risk of contracting\nthe. virus. Sharing drug-injecting\nequipment without sterilising it is\nan another way of spreading HIV.\nHIV/Aids surveillance in the\nricher countries has been complicated\nby\" the advent of anti-\n, retroviral drugs that stave off the\ndevelopment of Aids and prolong\nsurvival.\nWherever anti-retroviral therapy\nis widely available, it has increased\nthe incentive for people at\nhigh risk of HIV to get tested.\nFurther, there is extremj:ly worrying\nevidence that the advent of\nthe life prolonging therapies may\nhave led to complacency about\nthe dangers of HIV, and this may\nbe the cause of a rise in risky behaviour.\nA study in the US city of San\nFrancisco showed that in 1993-\nhomosexual men reported having\nhad unprotected anal intercourse,\nwhile the proportion of men reporting\nunprotected anal intercourse\nrose to one-half three\nyears later when effective death postponing\ntherapies had become\navailable.\nIf! the United States, HIV/Aids\ndeaths decreased by 42 per cent\nbetween 1996 and 1997, but by\nonly half that proportion between\n1997 and 1998.\nWestern Europe, too, witnessed a slowing decline in\nHIV/Aids deaths in as much as\nthey fell by 20 per cent, significantly\nless than the previous year.\nUnaids and WHO estimate that\nsome 1.5 million people were living\nwith HIV in Australia and\nNew Zealand and in the industrialised\ncountries of Western Europe\nand North America at the\nend of 1999.\nSome Latin American countries\nhave also joined the ranks of\nproviding anti-retroviral\ntreatment to those who are HIV positive.\nIp Argentina, where antiretrovirals\nare also provided,\nthere has been a fall of over 40\nper.: cent in the rate of new\nHIV/Aids cases reported each\nyear ...\nIn Uruguay, similarly low rates\nwere recorded among more' than\n8,000 workers tested in 1997,\nwith just 2.6 per 1,000 being\nHIV-positive.\nIn Central America and the\nCaribbean, access to antiretroviral\ntherapy is far more limited\nthan it is in South America.\nGuatemala, which spends $ 64\nper person per year on health, estimates that just 185 people have\naccess to anti-retrovirals among\nmore than 50,000 people living\nwith HIV/Aids.\nThe Caribbean basin has some\nof the worst HIV epidemics outside\nsub-Saharan Africa. In Guyana,\nHIV-prevalence was recorded\nat 3.2 per cent among blood\ndonors, while surveillance among\nurban sex workers showed 46 per\ncent were infected ..\nIn Haiti in 1996, close to six\nper cent of pregnant women tested\nwere HIV-positive. Infection - -\nrates approaching eight per cent\nhad already been registered in\npopulation estimated to be slightIy more than one billion and over \nfour million prostitutes, being\nHIV-positive. Behavioural surveys\nshow that in some towns,\nnine out of 10 sex workers have\nnever used a condom.\n':One country that has shown\nleadership in this area is Uganda,\nwhere some of the first HIV/Aids\ncases in Africa were identified in\n1982 and where the numbers of\n. orphans had exploded less than a\ndecade later.\n.\u2022As early as 1986, the Ugandan\nGovernment acknowledged the\n~IV/Aids crisis and began mobilising\nboth domestic and international\nsupport to combat it.
