{"text": "UN body warns\nover Aids\nLONDON. Tuesday\nMore than 2.6 million people\ndied from Aids this year - the\nworst since the epidemic began\n- and the death toll is set to rise\n-still higher in the new millennium,\nthe United Nations said\ntoday ..\u2022\nUNAids, the UN agency\ncharged with combating the\nspread of the deadly HIV virus,\nalso reported 5.6 million new\ninfections this year, bringing the\nglobal total to 33.6 million.\n. \"With the HIV-positive population\nstill expanding ...the Aids\ndeaths can be expected to\nincrease for many years before\npeaking,\" UNAids said in its\nannual update of the epidemic.\nEast European and Central\nAsian regions had the steepest\nHIV curve in 1999, mainly due to\nintravenous drug use.\nAlmost 20 years after the epidemic\nfirst hit, the agency predicted\nworse is still to come\nunless massive efforts are made\nto end the stigma that still surrounds\nAids in many countries.\nAlmost half of all people with\nthe disease were infected before\nthey turned 25. Half will. die\nbefore they reach 35.\n\"This age factor makes Aids\nuniquely threatening to children.\nBy the end of 1999, the epidemic\nhad left behind a cumulative total\nof 11.2 million Aids orphans,\ndefined as those having lost their\nmother before reaching the age of\n15,\" according to the report,\nwhich was launched jointly with\nthe World Health Organisation\n(WHO).\nIf children are not being\norphaned by the disease, many\nare infected themselves. An estimated 570,000 children\nare HIV-positive.\nMore than 90 per cent of them\nwere infected by their mothers at\nbirth or through breast feeding.\nAids experts said the disease is\nparticularly prevalent among\nAfrican women because it is more\neasily transmitted from men to\nwomen and in African populations\ngirls. are generally infected\nyounger than boys.\nFor every 10 African men with\nthe disease there are 12 or 13\ninfected women.\n\"Clearly, older men - who\noften coerce girls into sex or buy\ntheir favours with sugar-daddy\ngifts - are the main source of\nHIV for the teenage girls,\" the\nreport added.\nThe virus is expected to reduce\nlife expectancy in southern Africa\nfrom 59 in the early I990s to just\n45 between 2005 and 2010 -\nonly slightly above the levels\nachieved in the 1950s.\nEven in industrial countries\nwhere drugs have extended the\nlives of sufferers, the report\ndetails a new and misplaced complacency\namong gay men.\nPrevention is still the best\npolicy.\n\"The disease remains fatal, and\ninformation from North America\nand Europe suggests the decline\nin number of deaths due to\nantiretroviral therapy is tapering\noff.\"\nDespite the success of powerful\ndrug cocktails in reducing HIV to\nundetectable levels, studies' have\nconfirmed what doctors had long\nsuspected it will be very difficult,\nif not impossible, to completely\neradicate the virus in\npatients.
