{"text": "Step up campaign against Aids\nThe Press is doing a good job in disseminating information on HIV/Aids. A lot has been written\nabout the alarming spread of the HIV virus\nin Kenya. Day in day out, we read new threatening\nstatistics.\nWe have been informed that there is a higher\nincidence of Aids among married couples,\nthan among single people. Polygamy and immorality\nare some of the major causes.\nGovernment officials speak out against polygamy\nat every workshop, seminars and any\nother public forum they get. The clergy speak\nout against immorality in most of their sermons\nthese days. Therefore, every adult Kenyans\nmust have heard the Aids message loud\nand clear.\nThe problem is not that people have not\nheard of the HIV virus and Aids. The problem\nis that they do not realise, comprehend, acknowledge\nand accept the seriousness of the\nAids menace.\nSome people believe that because they have\nbeen fortunate enough to enjoy good health\nthroughout their lives, their luck won't run out.\nOthers believe Aids is a diseases that is acquired by \"other people\", but \"not me.\"\nSo long as these attitudes continue among\nKenyans, the Aids toll will keep on rising.\nAids is now an integral part of our system. It\ntranscends all tribal and social barriers. It has\ntaken its toll among pre-teens, teens, young\nadults, the middle-aged and the old.\nWe must, therefore, create more awareness\n,about the scourge and its implications at all\nlevels of our society. There is currently a commission\nof inquiry into the education system.\nThis commission is collecting views on how\nthe current system can be changed or\nimproved.\nHeadteachers and parents should tell the\ncommission about the need to make Aids education\nan integral part of the school syllabus.\nEvery child from the age of 10 should be educated on the various ways the HIV virus can be\ncontracted and the methods of prevention, Perhaps,\nit should be taught as a section in the biology\nsyllabus.\nAlternatively, it could be taught as a daylong\nclass in Christian Religious Education\nclasses. It is up to education experts to tell us where the subject can be taught to have maximum\nimpact.\nI urge the ministry of education to seek\nfunding from Unicef for the production of documentaries,\nwhich can be distributed free to\nevery school. I am sure discussions with Unicef\nshould yield some literature,\nVisual messages can have a great impact. I\nbelieve if more Kenyans saw the pain and suffering\nAids victims go through, they would\ntake preventive measures more seriously.\nOur economy is in dire straits. The only way we can win the battle against the spread of\nAids is for the government to take up the challenge\nto seek funds to ensure the dissemination\nof information on this scourge ..\nEverybody has a responsibility. The clergy\nshould continue to preach about the consequences\nof immoral behaviour. Churches are\nthe right venues for public talks and lectures on\nAids. A government-led, church-supported approach will have a tremendous impact in the\nfight against Aids\nAnna C. Kendall.\nNairobi."}
