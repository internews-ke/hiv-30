{"text": "TUESDAY, MARCH 30, 999\n\n\nWidows pay\u2028\n for defying\u2028\n tradition\u2028after\ntheir refusal to re-marry.\nAccording to Sr Juma, the future\nof these groups is bright and\nshe sees a day when the members\nwill become economically empowered,\ntrained and equipped\nwith skills and access to financial\nresources which would enable\nthem to engage more fully in profitable\nactivities.\n\"Only more viable activities\ncan provide a safe profit margin\nfor their needs to create a relative\nsense of independence and hence\nfree from risky sexual practices\nfor material or financial reward,\"\nshe said during the meeting.\nThe women's loneliness and\nvulnerability after the deaths of\ntheir husbands through Aids has\nnow been transformed by the\ngroup members who are now gallantly\nmarshaling emotional and\nphysical resources to lengthen\ntheir lives and provide for their\noffspring.\nTo many widows, the options\nare clear: re-marry or be disinherited\nand lose their late husband's\nproperty.\nOne of the widows narrated\nhow despite her in-laws knowing\nfully well that her husband had\ndied of Aids still insisted on urging\nher to engage in the ritual sex\nand would not hear about using a\ncondom!\nSaid one of the widows who\nspeaks openly about the scourge\nand its impact on their lives:\n\"Death of a husband usually renders\nwomen vulnerable to accepting\nrelatives' demands, including\nritual sexual cleansing which is\noften the most risky.\"\nThese widows also have to\nfight against a lopsided culture\nthat inter-alia dictates that they remarry\nregardless of their being\ncarriers of the killer virus and simultaneously\nwage war against\nstigmatisation that deny them life\nopportunities.\nResident in Nyando and\nKisumu districts, most of the widows\nhave gone for voluntary HIV\ntests to find out if they were positive.\nLast week, some of these widows\nshared their tribulations and\nhopes for the future with the US\nambassador when she toured the\nNew Nyanza General Hospital.\n\"I have been writing about Aids\nfor the past 10 years, but I have\nnever known that it is this bad,\" a\nmember of the Press corp that accompanied\nthe envoy was overheard\nsaying after the hour-long\ntour.\nThe envoy's entourage visited\nthree wards for men, women and\nchildren. Most of the emaciated\nAids victims were lying on their\nbeds staring into a bleak future.\nLike most members of her delegation,\nthe US envoy was moved\nas a number of the patients told\ntheir heart-rending experiences.\nLater, she held a meeting at the\nhospital with the widows group\nand senior medics, who included\nNyanza Provincial Medical Officer\nRichard Muga, the NNWI director,\nDr Ambrose Misore, the\nlocal head of the Centres for Disease\nControl, Drernard Nahlen\nand the envoy's husband Mr Stcve\nBackley.\nDr Misore said the widows'\nhealth status is further compromised\nby their low economic capacity\nas they are unable to purchase\nanti-viral drugs and instead\nthey have to be contented with the\ntreatment of opportunistic infection\nbody's weakened defence system\n\"They have no money to b\nanti-viral drugs, so the best is\ntreat opportunistic infection\nsaid Dr Misore.\nThe hospital chief said 60 to\nper cent of beds in their premier\nAmenity Ward were taken up\npatients with Aids-related\nailments.\n\"This really stretches our\nsources since such patients tend\nbe more severely sick and are I\npensive to attend to since they I\nten need fluids.\"\nBut he says they will never It\naway any patient for lack ofa be\nThey will even spread a mattresses\non the floor to take in more I\npatients, an arrangement he said\nprovided for in law.\nHowever, ultimate mass education home-based care of I\npatients is the solution. \"Unlike el~\nwhere in the world, people I\nbelieve their sick should (\npeacefully in hospital and r\npeacefully in their beds at home\nDr Muga painted a thought\nprovoking picture of the Aids situation in Nyanza, telling of he\nawareness levels were tip-top\nbeyond 95 per cent while behaviourial change remained a p~\nshadow keeping prevalence\nabove 30 per cent.\nSays Dr Muga: \"Gains we h;\nachieved in the health sector previously are now being undone\nwith the advent of HIV/Aids.\"\nHe warned that if the trend continues, it may in future prove difficult to sell family planning concepts to the public in light\nincreased deaths.\nHe said in a concerted effort\ncombat Aids, his office has al:\nreached out to Luo elders to he\nreview cultural practices that we\nonce beneficial but had been rendered dangerous in the advent I\n\"Aids.\nThe US envoy marked her \nvisit by laying the foundation of a proposed Sh9.15 million Medical Research Centre\nhospital, funded by \ncountry.\nHer simple and important message to the widows and Kenya\nIS a whole was: \"you can have\nAids, and live and work with dignity. One should not be stigmatised. \"\nThe envoy quoted a recent feature in the Nation which said\nhere were over 200 non-governmental organisations and community based organisations \nfighting the spread of\nscourge. She described the fight as \"daunting but not insurmountable.\"\nHer point was that Kenya'\nchance of having a healthy population in the future depended \ncurrently out fighting Aid:\nSingling out the 13 widows role models to that end.\nShe announced that her government invested $125 million to fund HIV/Aids prevention and mitigation activities both through the US Agency for International Development's in-country programmes and through support t\nUN agencies.\nIn Kenya, USAid spend\n3.5 million every year in Aid\nprevention and care activities.\n\"It is worrying that preliminary\nresults from a study on Rusinga\nIsland, Suba District indicate,\nthat 40 per cent of children in\nstandard six to eight had lost one\nboth parents to Aids. And before the end of 1997, a quarter of al\nchildren under-15 in sub-Saharan\n,Africa were living in a family affected by HIV/Aids,\" "}
