The\nteam to work in the Rift Valley\nProvince and Western Kenya, graduated\nlast week at Kiboswa ActionAid\nTraining Centre, Kisumu.\nThe group has been trained in medical,\ncommunication and sociology. They are\npart of the church's efforts to combat\nHIV/Aids spread by fighting it openly.\nThis is the second bunch to graduate\nthrough the programme eventually\nexpected to cover the church's 27\npresbyteries. The first bunch graduated\nin Ol-Kalao last September.\nSpeaking during the graduation\nceremony, the PCEA director of social\nresponsibility, Mr Francis Kihiko, called\non all churches to participate in the fight\nagainst Aids because the church is a\ntrusted and popular medium in Kenya,\n\"Unless people are aware of what the\nscourge is all about,\" Mr Kihiko told the\ngraduates, \"Aids will continue ,\nspreading. Preaching prevention and protection without enlightening people\nthe basics of the problem is like\nputting the cart before the horse,\" Mr\nKihiko said.\nThe PCEA Church has formed a\nspecial committee on Aids to create\nawareness in all its affiliate churches in\nEast Africa. The committee is headed by\nrepresentatives from its health board, -\ncommunications and Christian education\ndepartments.\nThe programme of training' social\nawareness volunteers has been dubbed\nTraining of Trainers (TOT). The trainers\nare taught 10 basic aspects of HIV/Aids\nfor their working purposes. The next\nthey are taught communication skills.\nAccording to the church's head of\ncommunications department, Rev Joseph\nNgare, the trainers are selected from all\nprofessions including nursing, teaching,\nfarming and preaching. By selecting\nfrom such a diverse strata and\nrepresenting both male and female, it is\n'expected that they will have a wider\nreach, says Rev Ngare.\nThe trainers must possess\npost-secondary education and are below\n55 years of age. They must demonstrate\ncompetence in English and be committed\n'Christians in the church. \"These people,\"\nRev Ngare says. \"are expected to work\nvoluntarily to save the rest of Kenyans.\"\nRecently, the PCEA secretary general\nPatrick Rukenya urged pastors to devote\na section of cburch proceedings on\n, Sundays to go towards efforts to fight\nAids. \"This effort will make more people\nrealise the danger posed by Aids and the\nneed to take the threat seriously,\" Rev\nRukenya said.\nHe said that PCEA started health\ncommittees at parish (church) level to\nfight against Aids.\nThe PCEA Church, while advocating\nfamily life education, has emphasised on\nawareness creation as the first step to\ncheck the spread of Aids.\nIn a recent notification to all its\npresbyteries, the PCEA Head office\nurged Kenyans to employ even those\ninfected with HIV so long as they are\nstill able to work. Instead of ostracizing\nthem it said, Christians should be helpful\nand understanding.\nAccording to Esther Toroitich, a\ncommunity worker who graduated at the\nKiboswa ceremony, the training they had\nacquired will help the graduates to talk\nopenly to people of all ages about Aids.\nShe said that unwillingness to tackle the\ntopic head-on has contributed to the\nsoaring of the disease.\nAnother graduate of the programme,\nCharles Omuga of Kisumu said that Aids\nhad totally affected the society in Nyanza\nProvince and it was time that awareness\ncreation was taken seriously.\n, The next bunch of trainers from the\nprogramme will graduate next February.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Presbytenan Church of East Africa\u2028\n(PCEA) has trained the first binich of 30\u2028\nconmiuni(y volunteers to work in ars\u2028\nHI V/Aids awareness programme.
