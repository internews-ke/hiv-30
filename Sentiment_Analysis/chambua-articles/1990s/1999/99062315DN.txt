{"text": "June 23, 99\n\nBank to fund Aids research\nFrom PAUL REDFERN\nNATION Correspondent\nin LONDON\nThe World Bank is preparing to\ninject about $5 billion into a\njoint project with the major\npharmaceutical companies to\nhelp develop a low-cost Aids\nvaccine for developing\ncountries.\nWorld Bank president James\nWolfensohn said that western\n, pharmaceutical companies had\nbeen reluctant to carry out detailed\nresearch on an anti-Aids\nvaccine in the developing world\nbecause of fears that they would\nnot get their money back.\nHe said it was for this reason\n1 that the bank would help to kick start\nthe research process.\nThe Guardian newspaper\nof UK on Monday reported that\nthe World Bank was proposing\nthe creation of a global health insurance\nprogramme to enable it\nto underwrite the search for afford~\nble anti-Aids drugs or a\nvaccme.\nThere are now hopes that a\nvaccine against Aids may be\nfound early in the new millenni-\n,um after research in Kenya and\nthe US, which showed that some\npeople appeared immune to the\ndisease, even when repeatedly\nexposed to the HIV virus. The\nstudies by a group of Kenyan\nscientists and British professor\nAndrew McMichael are still\ncontinuing.\nThe World Bank is critically\nconcerned that the Aids epidemic\nmay curtail the chances of\neconomic growth for Some African\ncountries.\nLife expectancy rates have\nbeen falling in countries such as\nUganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe\nand the epidemic often hits the\nmost economically productive\nsectors of the population.\n\"Aids has become a core development\nissue,\" Mr Wolfenson said. Confronting the Aids\nepidemic in developing countries\nhas become critical to all\nour efforts for poverty reduction,\ngrowth and Improved quality of\nlife.\"\nThe World Bank also believes\nthat, in the longterm, there\nwould be money to make by the\ndrug companies, as it is now estimated\nthat between 500 million\nand 1.5 billion people\nwould benefit from an Aids vaccine and that, even at a low cost,\nthis could still net around $50 billion for the big drugs firms.\nIn a joint operation with the\nWorId Health Organisation, the\nWorld Bank is planning to put in\nan initial outlay of around $5 billion\nto encourage the drugs industry\nto start detailed research.\n\"Our aim is to change incentives\nsufficiently, to mduce a\nmuch greater effort in developing\na vaccine,\" A World Bank\nspokesman said. \"Our message\nis that if a vaccine can be de- ,\nveloped, there will be the money\nto buy it.\"\nBut World Bank officials\nhave also stressed that it was important\nto ensure that any new\nvaccines for developing countries\nwould provide good value\nfor money and be medically effective.\n\"An Aids vaccine for low income\ncountries is an international\npublic good which is not likely\nto happen without innovative\ninternational public action,\" Mr\nWolfensohn said.\n\"Private industry must play\nthe critical role in developing\nand marketing a vaccine, but the\nprivate sector currently does not\nhave the incentives to develop\nan Aids vaccine for the strains of\nthe virus and the health system\ncapabilities of developing countries,\"\nhe added.\nThat is why the World Bank is\nstepping in."}
