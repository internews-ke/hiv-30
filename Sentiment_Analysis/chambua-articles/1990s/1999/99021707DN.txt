{"text": "Condoms are not the answer\nIt is unfortunate that when the\nAids crisis is raging, anybody\nshould openly advocate the use of\ncondoms as the surest way to control\nthe HIV virus.\nI am referring to a letter by a\nUNAids consultant (DN, Jan\n22) headlined, \"Ignore lies told\nabout condoms\". If condoms prevented Aids then the epidemic would not be as widespread as it is today.\nDuring the World's Aids Day last year, it was revealed that nearly 2 million people have been infected with HIV. And 300,000 Kenyans had died since Aids was first reported here in 1980.\nStrangely, the UNAids consultant even tried to suggest to the Nation what to publish.\nThe condom does not prevent\nAids. John Hopkins University in\nMaryland, United States, a leading\nresearch institute on reproductive\nhealth, has published reports\nshowing that the condom has a\nfailure rate of 15 to 20 per cent, in\npreventing pregnancy.\nScientists say the HIV virus is\n300 times smaller than human\nsperm. It could go through the latex\nrubber as easy as a cat through\na garage door. So if the failure rate\nof the condom. in preventing conception\nis up to .29 per cent, how\nmany times more is it in failing to\nprevent the HIV virus.\nThe John Hopkins University\nstudy showed that for the 100\nwomen tested with the condom, 20 of them became pregnant.\nThey could have been infected\nwith the HIV virus.\nThe writer says that one is safe\nwhen the condom is used \"correctly\nand consistently\". That may make some sense when talking about adults. But talking about boys and girls, one must be more realistic.\nA young man who has been seducing\na girl for weeks or months,\nand on a Sunday afternoon, a moment\npresents itself. There may\nnot be time to use the condom\n\"correctly and consistently\".\nAccording to a Family Planning\nAssociation of Kenya study\nwhich the writer quoted, 60 per\ncent of the adolescents believe\ncondoms will not prevent Aids.\nBut it is not because they\n\"come across letters such as the\none published in the Nation\".\nNo. It is because condoms do not\nprevent Aids.\nIt is not true that the young\npeople of today cannot abstain\nfrom sex. It is an insult to youth to\nsuggest that they cannot exercise\nrestraint and reason.\nRecently, I addressed some 250\nyoung men and women at a seminar\nin Nyeri. They said they are\nnot animals to be led by instincts.\nThey can and are in fact abstaining\nfrom pre-marital sex.\nFrancis Muroki.\nNairobi. o This correspondence is now\nclosed -Editor."}
