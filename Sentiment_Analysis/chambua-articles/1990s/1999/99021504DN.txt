{"text": "MONDAY DECEMBER 6 1999\n\nCelibacy \u2018hurts Aids campaign\u2019\n\nBy MOHAMMED MAINA\u2028\n\nCelibacy practiced by Catholic priests is a major impediment in\u2028\n\nthe fight against Aids, Permanent Secretary Joseph Kaguthi has said.\u2028\n\nThe Church\u2019s campaign against the use of condoms, Mr\u2028\n\nKaguthi said, was occasioned by the fact that the priests were governed by the doctrine, which put them out of the Aids circle.\u2028\n\nSpeaking at the weekend in Nyandarua District, the PS said the Church should be realistic and accept the available practical\u2028\n\nways of checking the spread of\u2028\n\nthe HIV/Aids. He told churches\u2028\n\nto leave those who could not ab\u2028\n\nstain from sex to use condoms as\u2028\n\nadvised by the President.\u2028\n\nIn view of the deterioration in\nthe society\u2019s moral standards, he\u2028\n\nsaid, the only way of containing\u2028\n\nthe spread of Aids was through\u2028\n\nthe use of condoms.\u2028\n\nThe Office of the President PS\u2028\n\nsaid if the church had failed to\u2028\n\ninstil the right morals, the government was obliged to advocate the\u2028\n\nuse of condoms to check the\u2028\n\nspread of the disease.\u2028\n\nNyandarua District Commissioner Claire Omolo said that 40 per cent of bed occupancy in hospitals in the district was by\u2028\n\nHIV/Aids patients, and cautioned\u2028\n\nCentral Province residents not tax\u2028\n\nin the fight against the disease in\u2028\n\nthe false belief that the scourge\u2028\n\nafflicted Nyanza Province alone.\u2028\n\nThe PS was speaking during a harambee in aid of Geta Secondary school where over Shl.5million was realised, with Mr\u2028\n\nKaguthi giving Sh266,500 which included ShSO,000 from President Moi (and Sh 10,000 from Nation Media Group Chief executive Wilfred Kiboro. The area\u2028\n\nMember of Parliament Mwangi Githiomi gave Sh30,000.\u2028\n\nMeanwhile, the clergy in Meru town were sharply divided yesterday over whether President Moi was right or not to encourage the\u2028\n\nuse of condoms in the control of\u2028\n\nAids spread.\u2028\n\nFormer Presiding Bishop of the\u2028\n\nMethodist Church in Kenya, Rev Lawi lmathiu, and the East African Pentecost Church Pastor, Rev\u2028\n\nDouglas Ikunyua, said non\u2028\n\npracticing Christians should be free to use condoms."}
