{"text": "Bank to put $5b in Aids research \nBy PAUL REDFERN\nNATION Correspondent\nLondon\nThe World Bank is preparing to\n.put forward around $5 billion into\na joint project with the major\ndrugs companies to help develop a\nlow-cost Aids vaccine for poor\ndeveloping countries in Africa\nand elsewhere.\nWorld Bank president James\nWolfensohn said that because\nWestern drugs companies had\nbeen reluctant to do detailed research\non an anti-Aids vaccine in\nthe developing world because of\nfears that they would not get their\nmoney back, that the World Bank\nwould help to \"kick-start\" the research\nprocess.\nThe Guardian newspaper reported\nthat the World Bank is now\nproposing the creation of a global\nhealth insurance programme to\nenable it to underwrite the search\nfor affordable anti-Aids drugs or a .\nvaccine.\nThere are now some hopes that\na vaccine against Aids maybe\nfound early in the new millennium\nafter research in Kenya and the\nUnited States which showed some\npeople appeared to immune even\nwhen repeatedly exposed to the\nHIV virus. The studies by a group\nof Kenyan scientists and the British\nProfessor Andrew McMichael\nare still continuing.\nThe World Bank is now critically\nconcerned that the Aids epidemic\nmay now curtail the\nchances of economic growth for\nsome African countries.\nLife' expectancy rates have\nbeen falling in countries such as\nUganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe\nand the Aids epidemic often hits\nthe most economically productive\nsectors of the population, young\nworking men and women.\n\"Aids has become a core development issue,\" Mr Wolfensohn\nsaid. \"Confronting the Aids epidemic\nin developing countries has\nbecome critical to all our efforts\nfor poverty reduction, growth and\nimproved quality of life.\"\nThe World Bank also believes\nthat in the long term there would\nbe money to make by the drug\ncompanies as it is IWW estimated\nthat between 500 million and 1.5\nbillion people would benefit from\nan Aids vaccine and even at a low\ncost this could still net around $50\nbillion for the big drugs firms.\nIn a joint operation with the\nWorld Health Organisation, the\nWorld Bank is now planning to\nput in an initial outlay of around\n$5 billion to encourage the drugs\nindustry to start detailed research.\n\"Our aim is to change incentives\nsuffidently to induce a much\ngreater effort in developing a vaccine,\"\nA World Bank spokesman\nsaid .. \"Our message is that if a\nvaccine can be developed there\nwill be the money to buy it.\"\nBut World Bank officials have\nalso stressed that it was important\nto ensure that any new vaccines\nfor developing countries would\nprovide good value for money and\nbe medically effective.\n\"An Aids vaccine for low income\ncountries is an international\npublic good which is not likely to\nhappen without innovative international\npublic action,\" Mr Wolfensohn\nsaid.\n\"Private industry must play the\ncritical role in developing and\nmarketing a vaccine but the private\nsector currently does not\nhave the incentives to develop an\nAids vaccine for the strains of the\nvirus and the health system capabilities\nof developing countries,\"\nhe added."}
