{"text": "KMA's stand\non Aids control\nOnce again the issue of the use\nof condoms a~ part of the\nnational Aids control is up in the\nair.\nExpectedly, the Catholic\nChurch is up in arms. They are\nagainst both sexuality education\nand the use of condoms. 'They\nwould rather make Kenyans\nbelieve that prayer and\nabstinence are the only answer.\nOur position on this is clear.\nYes, abstention must be\npreached. But condoms must\nalso be used. The reasoning is\nclear.\nThose who abstain (and it is\nour prayer that Catholic faithful\nwill  heed the advice of their\nbishops and priests) do not need\ncondoms. Thus the message for\ncondom use can be ignored by\nthose faithfuls.\nThe church is, however, fully\naware of the imperfect\nnature of man, and are witnesses\nof the massive loss of lives due\nto Aids, consequent to lack of\nadherence by their followers to\nthe concept of abstention.\nThe Catholic Church must\ndifferentiate between use of condoms\nfor contraception and its\nuse in stopping this massive but\ntotally unnecessary loss of our\nbrothers and sisters.\nWith regard to family life\neducation - FLE - only those\nwho enjoy burying young Kenyans\ncan dare oppose the  need\nfor information and education\non sexuality.\nDoes the church enjoy burying young Kenyans?\u00b7If they do\nnot, then let us join forces in\neducating and counselling the\nyoung at all appropriate venues\nincluding schools, churches and\nyouth organisations.\nLet us not blackmail' our\ncountry through threats and\nintimidation. Let us not be intolerant\nof differing views. Surely,\nis this not the very sin the\nchurch has accused our political\nleadership of?\nThe Kenya Medical Association\nfully supports the government\nin its efforts to fight Aids\ncomprehensively and without\ndiscrimination.\nDr A. J. O. Were \u2022\nNational Treasurer.\nKenya Medical Association.\nNairobi\nTreat HIV causes, not symptoms\nThe following statement is not false neither is\nit far fetched. \"Epidemics depend not only on\ninfectious agents but also on the social conditions\nthat sustain their spread.\" Aids is one\nsuch epidemic.\nMichael Merson, a US specialist in infectious\ndiseases, has had this to say. \"Aids is\ngaining ground everywhere but we now know\nhow to slow the spread of HIV.\"\nA focus on this forces one to look at the\nseething festering effects of Aids. There is an\noverwhelming economic and social. impact,\nparticularly in Africa. Employees face higher\nmedical costs, employers lose staff with valuable\nexpertise and communities witness break\nup of families as .more and more children are\norphaned.\nA number of people and pressure groups\nhave talked of prevention strategies. There are\neffective approaches based on knowledge\nacquired from a number of countries. The\nWorld Health Organisation recommends\nunconditional supply of uncontaminated blood\nand deliberate use of sterile equipment. On\nthese two there must be no debate ..\nOn another plain, sexual intercourse being\nthe primary mode of transmission of HIV,\npeople need to voluntarily change any sexual behaviour that may be detrimental to their\nwell-being. This is the most controversial area\nwith several stakeholders having divergent\nviews.\nWhereas some people, including the president\nof this country, have strongly supported\nthe use of condoms, others have vehemently\nopposed this. Questions often emerge regarding\nthe most vulnerable group falling in the\nmost sexually active bracket. Statistics\nshow us that the Aids menace worsens day in\nday out. Even in Thailand where there was a\n100 per cent condom use campaign in brothels,\na lurid picture hangs ugly over the disease.\nDoes condom use really reduce the\nspread of Aids?\nThe church must formidably continue\npreaching the gospel as it is. Abstinence to the\nsingles and faithfulness to one married uninfected\npartner should be their resounding call.\nIndeed this is the one solution that I am willing\nto stick my neck out for. It is 100 per cent\neffective. Only hypocrites can criticize the\nchurch on this.\nThe reality is that not everybody is an\nadherent of the church principles. This must\nnot, however, be an excuse for anybody to\nindulge in detrimental behaviour. Yet this is what happens.\nlife is not a one way traffic. The society\nneeds to indulge in truly proactive\nbehaviours .let's have media campaigns and\nspecial activities that aim to deter promiscuity\namong the youth. If it is true that the youth\ncannot abstain from sex, it is also true that the\nsame youth are dying prematurely because of\nthis practice.\nlet the society wake up from treating\nsymptoms and face the real causes of this epidemic.\nlet's focus more on prevention. let's\nhave role models standing up to be counted! !\nlet's have fun and entertainment without necessarily\nputting our lives on the line.\nAs long as we do not have sound principles\nand values guiding us at individual levels, we\nshall continue talking about Aids prevention\nto eternity without any solution. Life is precious.\nEven if only one person through\nresponsible behaviour saved one life, he/she\nwould have made a capital contribution to\nposterity.
