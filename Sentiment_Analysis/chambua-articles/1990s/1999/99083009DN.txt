Sunday\nSub-Saharan African health ministers\ngather in the Namibian capital\ntomorrow for week-long talks\non health issues, including the\ndevastating impact of  HIV/Aids\n'in , the region, which has 70 per\ncent of the world's infections.\nThe sub-continent's other major\nkillers, malaria and tuberculosis,\nwill also feature prominently at\nthe 49th session of the UN's\nWorld Health Organisation\nAfrica committee, said WHO\nofficial in Pretoria, Welile\nShasha.\n\"(But) the most pressing health\nissue facing Africa is\nHIV/AIDS,\" Shasha said.\nThe disease killed about two\nmillion people in sub-Saharan\nAfrica last year -- over 80 per\ncent of the global total- making\nit the leading concern of most of\nthe health ministers from 46\ncountries due to attend the\nmeeting.\nLast year, 70 per cent of the\nworld's 5.8 million new HIV\ninfections were recorded in sub-\nSaharan Africa, according to\nWHO, which is to present its\n1998 annual report for the region\nat the Windhoek meeting.\n\"The scourge of HIV/AIDS\nrequires exceptional measures as\nthe African region continues to\nbe the worst affected area in the\nworld,\" the report says.\n\"Despite this grim reality, the\npriority accorded to HIV/Aids in\nthe region has led to only some modest gains\" in combating the\ndisease.\nOf the estimated 550 million\npeople in the region, about 23\nmillion are infected with\nHIV/Aids.\nThe WHO regional director for\nAfrica, Mr Ebrahim Samba, in\nJune urged African governments\nto declare HIV/Aids a \"national\nemergency.\"\nHe said the continent was\nalready home to 95 per cent of\nthe world's Aids orphans and the\ninfection had cut life expectancy\nfrom 65 years a decade ago to\nabout 40 years now.\nThe rapid spread of the infection\nin Africa\u00b7 -.- which has only 10\nper cent of the world's resources\nis due to the tradition of\nunprotected sex, a high incidence\nof sexually-transmitted diseases\nand poor access to care and information,\naccording to WHO.\nHIV/Aids, the fourth leading\ncause of death worldwide, has\novertaken malaria as Africa's\nnumber one killer disease,\naccording to WHO. Malaria\nclaims about 1.5 million lives a\nyear.\nWHO's African Initiative for\nMalaria aims to halve the incidence\nof malaria by 2010 through\nvarious measures, including the\nuse of insecticide-treated bednets\nand drugs.\nAlso on the agenda for the meeting\nwill be health sector reforms,\nsaid Shasha, to \"make health care\naccessible to all people in each country.\"\nThe WHO's regional health-for all\npolicy for the next century\nand proposals for a mental health\nstrategy and health technology\npolicy will be debated, as will a\nplan to manage childhood illness.\nThe annual report covers a range\nof other health issues, from\nefforts to reduce the practise of\nfemale genital mutilation to\nintensive polio immunisation\nprogrammes.\n\"With adequate resources, it is\nexpected that polio will be eradicated\nfrom the African region by\nthe end of the year 2000 or\nshortly after,\" the report says.\nIn 1997, only 883 clinical cases\nof polio were reported in sub-\nSaharan countries, partly due to\nsuccessful immunisation programmes,\nfrom at least 5,000 new\ncases reported annually in the\n1980s.\nThe report also states that leprosy\nhad been eliminated in most\ncountries in the region by December\n1998.\n\"Countries which are at risk but\nare unlikely to reach the elimination\ntarget (Angola, Ethiopia,\nGuinea, Madagascar and\nMozambique) will need special\nsupport to enable them to achieve\nit.\"\nWHO regional committee for\nAfrica has also taken steps to\nprotect countries from the US \"tobacco\nindustry's aggressive effort\nto create new markets\" in developing\ncountries, the report says.\n(AFP)"}
