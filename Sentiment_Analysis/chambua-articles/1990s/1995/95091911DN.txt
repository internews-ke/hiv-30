By 2000 it is .forecast to\naccount for nearly 25 per cent of\nall HIV infections, which the\nWorld Health Organisation\nprojects at 40 million globally.\nGiven that young people, who\nare the most economically active\npopulation group, are the most at\nrisk, a big rise in the number of\ncases will hurt even thriving\nAsian economies.\n\"The impact of the epidemic is\npervasive and will effect all social\nstrata and all sectors of the economy,\"\nsaid Peter Godwin, chief of the United Nations Development\nProgramme's HIV Project.\nNeither Godwin nor Myo\nThant would put a monetary figure\non the economic impact of\nAIDS and HIV in the region, but\nsaid the economic impact would\nbe most acute for the region's\npoorer, less developed countries.\n\"The costs of illness and death\nwill be greatest for those least\nable to deal with these; that is,\nthe poorest Asia-Pacific countries,\"\nGodwin said.\n\"Some countries are able to\ncope with it,\" Myo Thant told\nreporters. \"Some countries like\nVietnam, Laos and Myanmar\n(Burma) cannot cope. They are\ntrying their best but they just\ndon't have the capability right\nnow.\" (REUTER)"}
