{"text": "Varsity students\nintroduction of \u2026\nFamily Life Education has\nbeen prescribed as the\nmost viable and cost-effective\nmode of curbing\nAids whose spread\nthreatens to wipe out the youth\nin this country.\nHowever, students attending\nthe first international conference\non Aids said FLE should not be\ntreated as an independent subject\nbut should be integrated into\nother subjects.\nThe FLE, the students recommended,\nshould not be examinable\nbut should be taken as an\nintegral part of education necessary\nto produce wholesome and\nresponsible citizens.\nThe students said the need for\nFLE was particularly urgent\nbearing in mind the fast spread of\nthe HIV virus in Kenya. They\nnoted that since 1985 when the\nfirst HIV case was identified in\nKenya there were more than\n700,000 HIV cases most of whom\nare youths aged between 18 and\n25 years.\nParticipants at the five-day\nconference carne to the conclusion\nthat the youth lack direction\nbecause there are no particular\npersons in the society who are\ncharged with the responsibility of\ngiving them the 'right information especially on sexuality.\nThey decried societal double\nstandards of morality, where the\nyouths are advised not to engage\nin irresponsible sexual behaviour\nyet their seniors are victims of\nthe same.\nThe group said it was improper\nto pretend that the youths were\npious and therefore did not engage\nin sexual activities but instead\nthe youth should be 'given\nthe right information to make informed\nchoices. They said studies\nhad indicated that many youths\nengaged in sexual activities irrespective\nof their religious\naffiliations.\nThe conference organised by\nthe University Students Aids\nControl Association and attracted\nstudents from polytechnics\nand the universities from\nUganda, Tanzania, Rwanda and\nSouth Africa said it was inappropriate\nto assume that FLE was\nbound to fail in the region as it\nhad not worked in the Western\ncountries.\nThe participants resolved that\nthere should be no subject known\nas FLE hut its components\nshould be integrated into other\nsubjects which were compatible to the subject such as Religious Education, Biology, Home Science and other subjects.\nThe students said the Governments should only develop the curriculum with proper consultations with other concerned bodies such as the church and the' parents. They said the top-down a\napproach created conflict between\nthe various parties.\nThe Church was under fire criticising what the government:\ncame up with without giving it an alternative. They said the Church should be a partner in the drafting of what is to be taught rather than being a critic all the time.\nThe students said the programme should not be based, on the Scouts Movement which they said was not acceptable to all since it carried some aspects which were not considered compatible with people from all faiths.\nThe group recommended that the FLE should not be left to the teachers alone but parents have\nan important role to play since\nFLE starts immediately after,\nbirth. They said FLE should not'\nbe narrowed to sex education only but should cover all areas off youth sexuality.\nDelegates from Makerere University which has an FLE\n\nFlanked by Mr Ephraim Imaya, an official of the University Students Aids Control Association (USACA), Conference Centre in Nairobi.
