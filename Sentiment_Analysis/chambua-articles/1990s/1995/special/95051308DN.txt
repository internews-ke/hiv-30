{"text": "Beast Virus\nturns humans into pulp\nBy Lindsay Griffiths, .\nin' LONDON, Friday\nIt normally feeds on pigs and\nmonkeys but the Ebola virus\ngripping-Zaire is now turning\nhuman flesh to pulp in an epidemic\nmote gory than AIDS.\nEbola leaves vile bodies in its\nwake - blood and body parts ooze\nfrom every orifice - but experts\nsay its victims turn to mush too\nquickly to spark a new  global\nplague.\nAs the worm-shaped virus\njumps from beast to man, victims\ndie a short but very nasty death.\n\"The only sound is a choking\nin his throat as he continues to\nvomit while unconscious,\" Richard\nPreston wrote in his best-selling\nbook The Hot Zone on deadly\nnew viruses.\n\"Then comes a sounds like a\nbedsheet being torn in half,\nwhich is the sound of his bowels\nopening at the sphincter and\nventing blood. The blood is\nmixed with intestinal lining. He\nhas sloughed off his gut.\nThe lining of his intestines\nhave come off and are being expelled\nalong with huge amounts\nof blood.\" .\nWhile the symptoms surpass\nany horror movie, the release: in\nBritain of a new Dustin Hoffman\nfilm chronicling a devastating viral\nspread has fuelled fears of a new killer to rival Aids.\nMedical experts call the Hoffman\nthriller \"science fiction\",\nBut like today's epidemic in\ncentral Africa, \"Outbreak\" is\nchilling fiction that could become nightmare\nfact.\nIn real life the virus is a Level\nFour pathogen - a step up from\nthe AIDS virus - and there is no\nknown cure.\nIt is one of the most lethal viruses\nknown to man, spread\nthrough close contact with blood\nor bodily fluids.\nWhile deaths thus far have\nbeen relatively few and most experts\nsay it does not compare to\nAids, its spread could yet be\ndevastating.\nToday, experts scrambled to\ncontain the virus, which kills nine\nin 10 victims.\nOfficials said Ebola had now\nfanned out to a third town in the\ncentral African st.ate of Zaire.\n\"There is no vaccine, no treatment,\"\nPreston told Reuters in\nthe United' States.\n\"Outbreaks burn themselves\nout quickly and victims don't live\nlong enough to pass it along.\"\nFirst comes fever, a sore throat\nand a headache.\nThe early symptoms are followed\nby vomiting, abdominal\n,pain and diarrhea Within two weeks of infection,\nthe uncontrolled bleeding begins -\ninternally and externally - as the\nhuman innards worm their way\nout through the eyes,' lips, ears\nand even skin.\n\"At the end the virus affects\nyour blood clotting mechanism .\nTo do a biopsy on such a patient\nis really a mess,\" Guido van der\nGroen, who investigated the first\noutbreak of the Ebola virus in\nZaire in 1976, told Reuters in\nBelgium.\nIndeed, tales of the vile bodies\nhave. gripped the British press,\nfamed for spreading scare stories\nabout a flesh eating bug that hit\nBritain and the United States\nlast year.\nBut experts note that\u00b7 Ebola\nhas absolutely no link with HIV,\nwhich causes Aids, and is unlikely\never to wreak the same havoc.\nIndeed Ebola's saving, grace is\nthe speed in which it kills - HIV\ncarriers have years to spread\ntheir virus - and experts from the\nworld over have rushed to Zaire\nto incubate carriers.\n\"It is a dwarf in terms of danger\nwhen compared to the giant\nof Aids,\" van der Groen said.\n\"I guarantee you that between\nnow ll.nd10 years we will not have\nEbola spreading all over the\nworld and infecting 20 to 30 mil.-\nlion people.\" (Reuters)"}
