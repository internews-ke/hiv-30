{"text": "Here\u2019s a numbers\ngame all will lose\nHealth Minister Joshua Angatia's dismissal of recent claims in the Press that blood in local banks was unsafe because a lot of it could be contaminated with the virus that causes Aids must be treated with the seriousness it deserves both by the Government and, the people.\nThe issue of Aids - which retired CPK Archbishop\nManasses Kuria last year said was one of the \"plagues\"\ndestroying Kenya - is very delicate and anybody making\n\"authoritative\" statements about it must be very sure of\ntheir facts because the consequences of an error are tragic.\nThe article Mr Angatia was dismissing was by Dr Patrick\nOsewe who,\u00b7 among other things, also claimed Kenyan\nlaboratory technicians were inept and lax.\nDuring a Press Conference on Thursday at his Afya\nHouse office in Nairobi, ..Mr Angatia said no blood is\ntransfused into a patient without being screened and results had shown that the margin of error was an \"internationally acceptable\" 0.1 per cent.\nHe said that in tests done by Kenyan scientists in\nconjunction with the US-based Centre for Disease Control\nat Atlanta, the two groups obtained nearly the same results or more specifically the same margin of error.\nFor example in Homa Bay, the two teams detected three\nHIV positive in 177 samples and 15 in 438 samples in New Nyanza Hospital.\nBut in Siaya and Kisii hospitals the Kenyans detected 11\nand four HIV positive while the Americans detected 12 and five respectively out of a sample size of 119 and 594. At Kenya's biggest hospital - Kenyatta - out of ,192 samples, the Americans detected nine cases while the Kenyans came up with a result of seven.\nScientists since Gallileo's time rarely agree with each\nother at first and it is irrelevant know who between Dr\nOsewe on the one hand, and the Kenyan and American\nscientists on the other, is right. What is of importance is\nthat both teams detected the Aids virus in blood meant for\ntransfusion, a situation made worse by the fact that the\nAmericans discovered more tainted blood than the Kenyans in just a few samples. What about country-wide?\nTo the scientists, the whole issue is a matter of figures\nand percentages without considering the human tragedy\nwhich that means. Two' pints of tainted blood passing\nthrough may not seem much in figures but those are two\npeople condemned to death and if they are married ....\nGranted, there is always a margin of error in most things.\nbut in Aids it's tragic if there is. So Mr Angatia and his\nscientists should not. play the numbers game with Dr\nOsewe. They 'should ensure even that 0.1 per cent margin of error is eliminated.'"}
