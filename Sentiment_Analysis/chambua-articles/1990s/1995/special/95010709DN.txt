{"text": "Aids test\nWASHINGTON: The government\nis allowing 30 Aids patients into a controversial experiment that will heat their blood to see if raising body temperatures to a dangerous 107.6 degrees Fahrenheit (42 degrees celsius) will slow the\nfatal virus. At issue is a hyperthermia procedure where doctors remove a patient's blood, heat it\nto 114 degrees f (45.5 celsius) and insert it back into the person until the entire body temperature rises to 107.6 degrees f (42 degrees celsius). Some doctors and Aids patients insist the treatment kills HIV, the Aids virus."}
