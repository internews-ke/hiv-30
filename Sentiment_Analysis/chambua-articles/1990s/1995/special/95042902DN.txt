Aids.\nMr Angatia said this when he;\"\"\nopened the 23rd Annual Scientific\nConference of the Kenya Medical\nAssociation at the Travelers\nBeach Hotel in Mombasa.\n,He said some communities still\nfound plausible folklore explanations\nto account for Aids, thus\ntending to disbelieve and discard\nscientific facts about the transmission of the deadly virus.\n\"Such attitudes have 'not '\nhelped much in curbing the\nspread of the virus\", he said.\nMr Angatia said although the\nknowledge base regarding HIV\ninfection was solid in Kenya, the\nexpected corresponding\nbehavioural change was still\nlacking.\n\"There is, therefore, a worry\n knowledge-practice gap which \nmust be closed.\"\nThe Minister challenged\nbehavioural scientists, particularly those specialised in psychology,\nsocial and cultural issues to\nlead the way in educating Kenyans to change their attitudes.\nHe said that the absence of\nspecific vaccine or therapy for\nthe HIV virus have. been rightly\nstressed by health workers and\nother scientists.\nHe said that the Ministry of\nHealth in conjunction with other\nMinistries had from time to time\nissued official HIV-related guidelines\nwhich have been stressed by\nhealth workers and other\n,scientist~.\nHe said that the guidelines\nhave covered issues such as blood\ntransfusions, counseling, precaution\nat work places and ethical\nmatters.\nInadequate health facilities\nhave put medical practitioners at\na great risk of contracting the\nHN virus\" the conference' was\ntold. .\nDelivering a keynote adding during the opening of\nconference, Prof Mutama\nMugambi, said that most Ministry\nof health facilities are very\ndeficient at present .. '\n\"Health facilities need to be\nequipped and adequately staffed'\nto handle diagnosis, blood Screening,\ncounseling and disease management\", Prof Mugambi said.\nHe-said the National Aids Control\nProgrammes have largely\nfailed to have the expected impact\n.due to local interference\nwith their operations including\nhigh staff turnovers ..\nHe said the Programmes have\nlacked local resources and hence\nheavily depended on donor funds ."}
