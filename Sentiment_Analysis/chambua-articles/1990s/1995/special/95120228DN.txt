' ' \u2028\nThese Kenyans will and are al- \u2028\nready experiencing many econom- \u2028\ndifficulties and no respite is visible. The present situation In Kenya \u2028\nindicate that there are over 57,000 \u2028\nreported Aids cases in the country \u2028\nsince the beginning of the epidemic in 1984. \u2028\nThe scrounge has now spread \u2028\nthroughout the country and Aids \u2028\ncases have been reported from every district. However, the reported \u2028\nnumber is only the tip Of an 'Ce- \u2028\nberg as there are more Cases which \u2028\ngo unreported because either the \u2028\nvictims do not seek medical care \u2028\nor because some doctors do not re- \u2028\ncord the diagnosis as HIV/Aids \u2028\ndue to the fear of stigmatisation \u2028\nto the family or Of insurance \u2028\nbenefits. \u2028\nThe Other reason why many \u2028\nmore Aids cases go unreported is \u2028\nbecause some people with HIV infection die of other diseases before \u2028\nbeing diagnosed as Aids victims or \u2028\ndue to lack of diagnostic facilities \u2028\nfor HIV testing in the rural health \u2028\nfacilities. \u2028\nThose infected With Aids are estimated to be over 850 which \u2028\nincludes 35,000 children, but most \u2028\nOf them have not the slightest idea \u2028\nthat they are infected. \u2028\nSince 1990, the HIV prevalence \u2028\nrates have been rising rapidly from \u2028\n3.3 cent in 1990 to 4.4 per cent \u2028\nin 1591 and 5.5 per in 1992. \u2028\nThe National Aids/STD Control \u2028\nProgramme (NASCOP) estimates \u2028\nthat the prevalence rate may have \u2028\nrisen to over per cent by the \u2028\nend of last year. The urban prevalence rate is estimated to rise to \u2028\nbetween 14 and IS from its 1992 \u2028\nrate Of between 10-11 percent _ \u2028\nIn some parts Of the country, it \u2028\nis estimated that out of every 18 \u2028\nadults, one is infected with the \u2028\nz 40 \u2028\no \u2028\n.1987 \u2028\nREPORTED AIDS CASES \u2028\n1987.1995 CUMULATIVE \u2028\nimplemented in eight districts \u2028\nthrough the Kenya Institute Of \u2028\nEducation with the support of \u2028\nUNICEF. \u2028\nThe emphasis has been on Family Life Education for young \u2028\npeople in order to provide them \u2028\nWith the information to protect \u2028\nthemselves from HIV infection. \u2028\nCommunity based Aids education has been identified as a means \u2028\nfor behaviour change and sustainability Of Aids education projects/ \u2028\nactivities within \u2028\nIt has been accelerated through \u2028\ntraining Of multisectoral service \u2028\nproviders Who are expected to pro- \u2028\nVide services to individuals, \u2028\ngroups and community through \u2028\ncounselling services, public educa- \u2028\nlion and peer education. \u2028\nThis strategy also addresses the \u2028\nissues of Aids/STD in the work- \u2028\nlace and a series of initiatives \u2028\nhave been undertaken by NASCOP in \u2028\ncollaboration with the Ministry of \u2028\nLabour and Manpower Development, Federation of Kenya Employers and Non-Governmental Organisations. \u2028\nThe World AIDS Day that was \u2028\nObserved the world over yesterday \u2028\nis an annual event commemorated \u2028\non December 1 worldwide. \u2028\nThe theme for this year is \u2028\nShared rights, shared responsibilities which was chosen by \u2028\nthe World Health Organisation \u2028\n(WHO) In consultation With Other \u2028\nUnited Nations agencies and leading Non Governmental Organisations. \u2028\nWHO aims to highlight the importance Of equality and solidarity \u2028\nIn the global response to HIV/Aids. \u2028\nHIV pandemic can be addressed effectively Only if rights \u2028\nand responsibilities are shared \u2028\nequally across the globe, says Dr. \u2028\nHiroshima Nakayama, Director- \u2028\nGeneral of WHO\u2028\n. 'People share the rights \u2028\nwhether or not they are infected \u2028\nWith HIV.

Men in \u2028\nparticular, because Of their dominant status in many societies, has \u2028\nthe responsibility to practise safe \u2028\nFamilies and communities have \u2028\na responsibility to educate their \u2028\non Aids prevention, am \u2028\nto care for those affected by H \u2028\ngovernments, fulfilling their duty \u2028\nto protect public heal have a responsibility to implement appropriate HIV prevention policies \u2028\nto ensure that all their citizens \u2028\nhave equal access to health \u2028\nservices. \u2028\nFor its part, continues WHO, t \u2028\ninternational community has the \u2028\nresponsibility to ensure effective \u2028\nglobal co-operation On HIV/Ai \u2028\nand to support poorer \u2028\nmeeting the challenge. \u2028\nFor the world AIDS Day 9 \u2028\nCONTINUED NEXT PAGE \u2028\nHIV While in some urban \u2028\none in every nine adults is in- \u2028\nReports from all parts Of \u2028\ncountry record high prevalence Of \u2028\nHIV infection among pregnant \u2028\nwomen as from 20-30 out Of every \u2028\n100 tested. \u2028\nFor the IOW prevalence rate, the \u2028\nrange is between 2-10 out of every \u2028\nI (H) women tested but the treatment could lead to reduction in \u2028\neconomic growth \u2028\nSectors to be affected most will \u2028\ninclude the security forces and others in mobile work such as transportation extension services and banking will also be affected since \u2028\nmany of the workers are young \u2028\nsexually active men Who are away \u2028\nfrom their families. \u2028\nDeaths of strong people in the \u2028\ncountryside Will affect the agricultural sector and hence the capacity \u2028\nOf the families and consequently \u2028\nthe country's capacity to feed \u2028\nitself. \u2028\nIn such a scenario, farmers will \u2028\nembark on less labour requiring \u2028\nfood crops than on cash crops \u2028\nwhile the Aids- affected, the dying \u2028\nand the dead will require attention \u2028\nfrom the living whether children Or \u2028\nOld people _ \u2028\nFortunately, this horrendous \u2028\nis not new to Kenyans.

Dr. Kayo observes \u2028\nthat poverty makes people vulnerable to factors which enhance the \u2028\nspread Of HIV such as high risk \u2028\nsexual behaviour. \u2028\n\"There is no reason why such \u2028\ncannot use condoms if they \u2028\nmust have sex,\" he says and \u2028\nstresses that \"we shall go out of \u2028\nour way to reach places where \u2028\nthese activities take place including bars and lodging houses to get \u2028\npeople to realise that we now have \u2028\nto convert awareness into action.' \u2028\nDr Kayo who is a Senior Director of Medical Services is convinced that discipline and morality \u2028\nare the central issues which must \u2028\nbe addressed by all including \u2028\nchurches, mosques, schools and \u2028\nfamilies because the society needs \u2028\nto re-evaluate itself. \u2028\nHe Says Kenyans must now 100k \u2028\nback and revisit the traditional \u2028\nAfrican way of looking at issues as \u2028\nThe plan called for action in six \u2028\nmajor strategies: \u2028\nprevention of sexual transmission Of HIV/Aids. \u2028\nUnder this section which \n\u2028\nand Out Of action is being \u2028\nMany Aids cases go unreported \u2028\nbecause some people with HIV infection \u2028\ndie of other diseases before being \u2028\ndiagnosed as Aids victims or due to lack \u2028\nof diagnostic facilities for HIV \u2028\ntesting in the rural health facilities. \u2028\nThose infected with Aids are estimated to be \u2028\nover 850,000 which includes 35,000 \u2028\nchildren, but most bf them have not4fie \u2028\nslightest idea that they are infected \u2028\nshows that it is rising fast. \u2028\nAccording to NASCOP , areas \u2028\nlike Kisumu With high infection \u2028\nrate seems to be levelling at 20 per \u2028\ncent _ The average HIV rate among \u2028\nwomen Of reproductive age is esti- \u2028\nmated to be seven percent. \u2028\nWhat do this chilling figures \u2028\npeople with well-paying jobs, then \u2028\nthe Impact is more felt than the absolute number of Aids deaths. \u2028\nBecause the costs of \u2028\nAIDS which include expenditures \u2028\nfor medical care, drugs and funeral \u2028\nexpenses are financed Out Of Savings, then the reduction in invest- \u2028\nAGE SEX DISTRIBUTION OF AIDS CASES \u2028\n1986 - NOV. 1995 \u2028\nFEMALE \u2028\n\u2022 15-59 .20-29 \u2028\nAGE GROUPS \u2028\nA billboard that to warn the public \u2028\ncasual sex as there is no cure for Aids.
