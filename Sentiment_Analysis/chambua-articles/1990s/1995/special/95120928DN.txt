The rallying theme this year \u2028\nis: \"30 years at work: Alleviating \u2028\nhuman suffering. ' \u2028\nFrom an extension of the British \u2028\nRed Cross Society in 1939, the \u2028\nKRCS has emerged as an efficient \u2028\norganisation Of charity at the local \u2028\nlevel today. \u2028\nThe organisation has grown in \u2028\nstrength, attracted many members \u2028\nand made a mark in the country. It \u2028\nis today held in high esteem and regarded as a saviour of the people at \u2028\nt time Of need. \u2028\nIts history dates back to the war \u2028\ntime. On the eve of the Second \u2028\nWorld War in 1939, the British Red \u2028\nCross was all out to strengthen the \u2028\nlocal chapter as well as others in the \u2028\nregion to prepare them for coming \u2028\nhumanitarian challenges. \u2028\nAt the time, Red Cross activities \u2028\nwere reserved for the white-minority. \u2028\nIn preparation to With the \u2028\nSecond World War. a network of I I \u2028\nRed Cross branches were established in the areas then referred to \u2028\nas the White Highland. \u2028\nWhat were the activities then? \u2028\nTogether with the St John Ambulance, the Red Cross offered first \u2028\naid training and home nursing to the \u2028\nEuropean settlers and later the services were extended to everybody. \u2028\ndiverted \u2028\nThey also \u2028\nto \u2028\nother welfare activities which included: Junior Red Cross activities \u2028\nwithin the school systems. \u2028\nalso staled health institutions like the Dagoretti \u2028\nCentre and. offered relief for those \u2028\naffected by wars and other calamities. \u2028\nOther voluntary activities were \u2028\ntracing missing persons, farm dispensaries, hospital comforts and \u2028\nloans of equipment to handicapped \u2028\npeople. \u2028\nThe Mau Mau uprising was a \u2028\nturning point in the history of the \u2028\norganisation. it necessitated indiscriminate assistance. Help was given \u2028\nGrassroot \u2028\nen to all in recognition of one of its \u2028\nfundamental principles \u2014 neutrality to victims of armed confrontation. \u2028\nMr Andrew Okoth, a KRCS long \u2028\nserving staff, says assistance to the \u2028\nlocal population during the emergency included medical services, \u2028\naid and blood transfusion. \u2028\nA major relief effort was \u2028\ntaken after the Lari massacre. \u2028\n\"The Red Cross volunteers organised health and welfare \u2028\nprogrammes for women and children in detention camps.\" says Mr \u2028\nOk 0th. \u2028\nBy the early 1960s, the Kenyan \u2028\nbranch of the British Red Cross was \u2028\na small but well organised institution which gave humanitarian \u2028\nassistance and social services. \u2028\nMr Okoth says the branch owned \u2028\na building at St Johns Gate, \u2028\nNairobi, which housed its head office and operated a number of clinics, nutrition centres, homes for the \u2028\nhandicapped and it had a substantial centre Of active volunteers. \u2028\nWith an exodus Of volunteers \u2028\nfrom British With the advent Of in- \u2028\ndependence in 1963, clamour for a \u2028\ntrue local organisation gathered \u2028\nmomentum. The First Mayor of \u2028\nNairobi, Mr Charles Wanyoike Rubia. assumed leadership of the local \u2028\nbody as Mrs Rachael Mzera became its first director. \u2028\n\"Our acceptance of the Geneva \u2028\nconventions must never become \u2028\nempty words or a meaningless connection Other societies. It is \u2028\nnow up to us Red Cross people of \u2028\nKenya to spread the knowledge Of \u2028\nthe rights and duties we have in the \u2028\nRed Cross.
