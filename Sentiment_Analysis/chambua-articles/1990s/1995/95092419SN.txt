{"text": "Key to a manageable family unit\nFROM PREVIOUS PAGE\nmen refuse family planning on religious grounds.\nAll this put together, indicates\nthat lack of accurate information\non vasectomy contributes highly\nto its being not well accepted not\nonly in Kenya, but the world\nover.\nThrough an intensive six\u00b7\nmonth (July 1994\u00b7January 1995)\ncampaign conducted in the local\nPress and electronic media, the\nlevel of awareness on vasectomy\nhas risen sharply and public interest\nin the operation has been\nstimulated.\nAccording to 1993 statistics\nfrom Marie Stopes Kencom Clinic,\na total of 351 men were seen at\nthe clinic out which 42 accepted\nto undergo vasectomy.\nSeventy one per cent were below\n40 years, 40 per cent had attended\ncollege or university\neducation.\nA total of 57.1 per cent of them\nhad three to four children. Most\ngave enough children as the reason for requesting vasectomy.\nMarie Stopes clinics have performed\nover 200 vasectomies all\nover the Republic. Statistics also\nindicate that:\n\u2022 Twenty five per cent of those\nundergoing vasectomy resumed\nsex within one week, 37.5, 7-10 days and 37.5 per cent after two weeks. \nNo physical or psychological\nchanges were observed even after\na six weeks follow up.\n\u2022 During the baseline studies that\nwere conducted by Innovative\nCommunications Systems (ICS)\nin 1992 in Nairobi and Mombasa,\nit was established that most men\nfelt uneasy mixing in the family\nplanning clinics with women and\nchildren.\nSome men said they felt lost as\nthey entered into these clinics .\nThe results of the studies were\na pointer to the need of establishing\n\"men's only family centres especially\nin leading urban centres\nsuch as Nairobi, Mombasa and\nKisumu.\n'The centres are staffed with\nspecially trained personnel on the\nneeds and concerns of men.\nThe \"men only\" centres have\nproven to be an innovative idea\nto usher men into family planning participation .. For instance, at a men's only\ncentre in Kencom, 42 vasectomies\nwere recorded in 1993, an\nincrease of 20 from the 1992 figure.\nIn 1994, the figure shot to 64.\nHowever, these centres do not\nrestrict men to family planning\nservices alone .\nThe centres also provide other\nmale reproductive health related\nservices including counselling on\ninfertility, sexually transmitted\ndiseases and HIV /Aids.\nAccording to a report on the\nprevalence of the male based\nbirth control method entitled Vasectomy:\nNew Opportunities\nwhich is jointly produced by the\nPopulation Information\nProgramme and the United\nStates Agency for International\nDevelopment (USAID), two\nyears ago, only 42 million men\nhad agreed to undergo vasectomy\ncompared to over 140 million\nwomen who had accepted to undergo tubal ligation.\nVasectomy is a major contraceptive alternative in the Netherlands,\nNew Zealand, Australia,\nGreat Britain, Canada, United\nStates China, India and South\nKorea.\nIn Kenya, only 500 men have\nundergone vasectomy to date.\nThe first two were performed in\n1976.\nCompared to other birth control\nprocedures, vasectomy especially\nthrough the \"no scalpel\"\n. technique, is a much safer and simpler method, which carries\nlesser risks of complications.\nIn the long-term, it is also\nmore cost-effective, convenient'\nand dependable.\n\nFacts about vasectomy:\nVasectomy is for men who want\nno more children.\nVasectomy is a method of family\nplanning which lets a man enjoy\nsex without causing\npregnancy.\nVasectomy is a simple operation\nwhich prevents the sperm\ncells (which make a woman pregnant)\nfrom becoming party of the\nseminal fluid which comes out\nwhen a man has an organism.\nVasectomy is quick and\npainless.\nVasectomy is a permanent\noperation. You and your partner\nwill never have to use temporary\nmethods again.\nVasectomy is one of the cheapest\nmethods of family planning.\nVasectomy is: \nNot castration (the removal of testicles). No part of the body is removed.\nNot visible. No one will know\nthat you have had a vasectomy\nunless you tell them.\nNot immediately effective. The\ncouple must use another form of\ncontraception after the vasectomy\nfor at least three months. \nHow does vasectomy work?\nThe operation usually takes\nabout 10 minutes.\nYou will be awake during the\noperation.\nYou may be asked to rest in the\nclinic for about 30 minutes.\nThe whole visit to the clinic\nlasts about one hour \nBefore having vasectomy:\nTalk about it with a doctor or\ncounsellor.\nIt is a good idea to bring your\nwife with you so you can decide\ntogether if vasectomy is the right\nfamily planning method for you.\nFind out about your health.\nPeople with diabetes, bleeding\ndisorder or heart disease should\nhave the vasectomy done in a\nhospital.\nIf you have a sexually transmitted\ndisease it should be treated\nbefore your vasectomy. \nAfter your vasectomy: It is normal to have a little\nbruising and swelling for a couple\nof days, but if you have a fever or\nnotice pus or bleeding in the area,\nyou should go back to the doctor\nright away.\nYou can have sex as soon as its\ncomfortable for you.\nSometimes the tubes will grow\nback together, though this is very\nrare.\nThe clinic may suggest that\nyou come back after 20 ejaculations\nto make sure that to make\nsure that the vasectomy worked. Questions normally asked about\nvasectomy:  \nQ: What happens to the sperms?\nA: They are still produced in the testicles, but since the tubes are blocked, they are no longer part\nof the ejaculation. Instead, they\nare naturally and harmlessly absorbed\nby the body.\nQ: Will my ejaculations be less? \nA: Sperms are only a small part of ejaculation fluid and the rest is semen, which is not affected\nby vasectomy.\nQ: What if I want to get another baby?\nA: If you want another baby, you\nshould not have a vasectomy. Vasectomy\nis a permanent method of contraception.\nQ: Are there any side effects?\nA: Vasectomy has no known long\nterm side effects. Sometimes vasectomy\nhas short term side effects,\nbut these are easily treated.\nFacts indicate that the method is\none of the safest contraceptive\nmethods.\nQ: Will I grow fat or weak?\nA: This is sometimes the worry of\npeople because they see what\nhappens to castrated animals.\nBut remember, vasectomy is not\ncastration. You will be strong and\nenergetic.\nQ: Will I still be a man?\nA: Yes. You will still produce\nmale hormones, have erections,\norgasms and ejaculations. Your\nsemen (fluid) will look exactly the\nsame, except that it will not carry\nany sperms. Those who have had\nvasectomy say that sex gets better\nafter vasectomy because they\ndon not worry about making\ntheir partners pregnant.\n\nA couple agonises how to make ends\nmeet to feed and clothe their family in\na playing promoting the case for a\nsmall family."}
