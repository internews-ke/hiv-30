{"text": "Aids preventive strategy working\nBy SUNDAY NATION Reporter\nA team of scientists with the African Medical Research Foundation (AMREF) has completed a trial study showing that a programme to improve the diagnosis and treatment of STDs in Government health units in Tanzania has succeeded in cutting down the occurrence of HIV infection by half.\nThe trial, according to AMREF's Isabel Mbugua, was a collaborative study between AMREF, the Tanzania National Institute for Medical Research, the Tanzania Ministry of Health, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp.\nMost HIV infections among adults in sub-Saharan Africa, are spread through heterosexual intercourse, and this is thought to occur more easily if either a sexual partner has conventional STD such as syphilis or gonorrhoea.\nThe rapid spread of HIV in some parts of Africa, she says, may be due, at least partly, to the high prevalence of inadequately treated STDs.\nMs Mbugua says in her statement that until recently, there was no information available to indicate the impact that such an intervention might have if applied in the general population.\nSuch data, she says, has now been provided by a trial in the rural population of Mwanza region in North Western Tanzania.\n\u201cTwelve rural communities were selected, and HIV prevalence was measured in 1,000 adults from each community. About 4 per cent were infected. STD treatment services were improved in six of the communities (selected at random) through a training programme for health workers and the provision of more effective drugs, Two years later, a follow-up survey of the same group was conducted, after which the improved services were extended to the remaining six communities,\" she adds.\nThe incidence of new cases of HIV infection over two years in the communities with improved services was around 1 per cent, compared with 1.8 per cent in the comparison communities.\nAfter adjusting for the effects of other risk factors, the investigators estimate that the intervention reduced the incidence of the new HIV infections by 40 per cent, a highly significant effect.\nMs Mbugua says this was the first randomised trial to show a significant impact of a prevention strategy on HIV in the general population."}
