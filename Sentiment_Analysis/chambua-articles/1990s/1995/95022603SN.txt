{"text": "More than words could say\nBy ANTHONY NJAGI\nThe best three plays, dances and poems were performed during the World Aids Day celebrations at Nairobi's Ziwani hall last Friday.\nLocal effort in artistic communication on Aids were successfully achieved by groups who performed educational, informative and entertaining items.\nThe event was organised by the, Aids Prevention Network (APNET).\nIn drama, the winning trophy went to the Parots Theatre Group based in Nairobi with their play The Miners. \nThe play had a strong cast of three, Erastus Owuor (Anende), Jorry Aurah (Bambo) and Angela\nWanjira (Nurse).\nThe play had a powerful plot dwelling on two comical miners in an infamous mining project who become carriers of the HIV Virus through dubious ways.\nHis prowess in assuming and shading of characters and his imitations of animal character earned him endearment from the audience.\nBlack Memories, who-had earlier won in the preliminary, took the third position perhaps because they had been over-confident.\nThe star-studded line-up included George Otieno, Samson Kaunga, Edwin Saka, Mercy Shikwe, Peter\nMwangi and Esther Mpaka.\nIn the dance section, Chelepe arts group also turned tables against the previous winners, Mombasa-based\nPwani Theatre Arts, when they presented a well choreographed drama dance."}
