{"text": "Crucial health ministers I'meeting in the balance\nBy PAMPHIL' KWEYU\nin ADDIS ABBA\nThe 5th Conference bf African\nHealth Ministers (CAHM-V)\nwith a close thematic link to the\nFourth International. Women's\nConference in Beijing, China,\nmay 'after all not take place.\nScheduled for .April 24-28,\nCAHM-V with the theme \"Situation\nof Women in Africa in the\nContext of the Family Health\"\ncould abort because this proposed\nvenue, the UN Commission for\nAfrica's (Uneca) conference hall\nhere, will be occupied by a Uneca sponsored\nAfrican ministers for planning meeting ..\nThe Organisation of 'African\nUnity (DAU) is desperately\nsearching for another host. However,\nno country had 'offered to\nstep in as of last month at the\nend of the third and final preparatory\nmeeting. \"Holding the\nmeeting here would have made a\nlot of cost sense,\" say~ Dr O. J.\nKhatib, the head of OAU Health\nand Nutrition Division (HND).\nThe OAU had get aside\n$25,000, with a firm commitment\nto get a grant of $30,000 from the\nWorld Health Organisation\n(WHO). \"The OAU calendar to\nthe end of the year is tight and should the meeting abort, we shall have to wait for another year;\" says Khatib, who fear costs could change as a result.\nThe meeting was planned amigst a worsening health profile, explicitly summarised in some 14 technical reports prepared by the UN\" non-governmental agencies arid the OAU.\nCritical areas included the Aids scourge and various \"diseases of poverty\".\n\"We cannot be expected to do anything more, while at the same time, this meeting forms an urgent agenda in facing Africa's health crisis,\" says Mr J. A. \nJorgensen, from the WHO Division of Inter-Agency Affairs in Geneva. \n\"It is a sad affair. Somebody should surely come to the rescue,\" says Mrs Caroline Karoma, the Executive Secretary of the Inter-African Committee on Traditional Practices Affecting the Women and; Children(lAC).\nThe 15-page comprehensive position papers prepared by agencies with observer status with the OAU are normally discussed by a meeting, which brings together African ministers and up to four' senior health officers.\nThe OAU Secretary General, Dr Salim Ahmed Salim, who expected to present two papers evaluating the 1990 CAHM-IV and shading some light on the' future, says while the OAU is not an executing agency, it offers the needed  publicity to health decisions 'and 'recommendations taken by collaborating executing organisations. \nHIV/Aids, with an. Estimated 20 million Africans expected to test HIV-positive by the year of 2000, features in the OAU Secretary' General's \"Report of the OAU in the Field of Health (1991-1995)\". Two meetings resulted in the Dakar Declaration on Aids epidemic in Africa (1992) and the Tunis Declaration on Aids and the Child in Africa.\n\"Tunisia convened' an interagency meeting to follow up on the declarations. The meeting sought to identify agency activities in HIV/Aid\\\" identify gaps and overlaps on planned and ongoing work and: possible solutions, and to decide on support to OAU to facilitate monitoring and reporting on the implementation of the Declaration,\" says Salim.\nOAU member-states made great contribution to the 1992 International Conference on Nutrition (lCN) in Rome, where the African Regional Nutrition Strategy (ANS), was adopted.\nBut Salim says 'a lot remains to be done. \"Anaemia is blamed for 70 per cent of maternal anaemia\nin Africa. The risk of death during\npregnancy is one 'in every 14\nwomen in Africa compared to one\nin 4,000 in developed countries,\"\nsays Salim.\nSalim also calls for improved\ninfancy mortality rates (1M) and\nunder five mortality rates\n(U5MR). While some countries\nsuch as Kenya had reduced\nU5MR to 51 in every 1,000 live'\nbirths, others like Angola had\nrates of 170.\nSalim has listed a 23-point\nplan of action identifying the\nstage of growth, related problems\nand strategies.\nThe problems range from discrimination\nin access to essential\nitems and services such as food\nand education, through excessive\nworkload, female genital mutilation\n(FGM), child labour, abuse\nand exploitation.\nOthers are early and unwanted\npregnancies, sexually transmitted\ndiseases (including 'HIV /Aids),\nmalnutrition, infertility, maternal\nmortality, cancers of the cervix,\nbreast and uterus, menopause,\ncarcinomas, mental\ndisorders, violence and occupational\nand environmental\nhazards.\nWhile 'offering wide ranging solutions,\nincluding education, information\ncommunication, creation\nof a supportive policy and legal frame work and implementation and special congresses, Salim\nstress on the role of money.\nSalim said an ordinary session\nof the Council of Ministers ratified\na resolution for the creation\nof a Special Health Fund for\nAfrica (S FA) to consist of an\ninitial $20 million from various\nsources up\" to 'date, only\n$489,894.4 has been raised\".\nThe. IA paper expands on\nsome of t e issues raised by the\nOAU Secretary General. These\ninclude F M, an abuse with a\nprevalence of five per cent in\nUganda an Zaire to 85 percent\nof all females in Djibouti and Somalia.\nBetween 85 and 114 million\nfemales across Africa have\nbeen circumcised, exposing them\nto various birth complications,\nsays the I C paper.\n\"Population growth and deeply\nentrenched traditional practices\nincrease the ranks by two million\nannually.\" ,.a\nIAC lists on preference \nblamed for inadequate care for .\nthe girl child - early marriage\npoor distribution of health facilities and unsafe motherhood as\nthe other major problems facing\nAfrican women.\nIAC's resolutions call on OAU\nmember states to outlaw female\ncircumcision , provide free and,\ncompulsory education up to high\nschool, outlaw the marriage of\ngirls under 18 years, support\nworkable adult literacy programmes\na d set aside at least 20\nper cent of the budget to women\nand child are.\nThe International Labour Organisation\n(ILO) paper raises\nconcern over women's occupational\nsafety and health as they\n.enter the informal sector. \"It is\nimportant attach a double importance\nto this problem as the\nmajority of the female labour\nforce are both mothers and\nhousewives, ' said Mr Jan Pieter\nKleijburg from the ILO/Eastern\n\"Africa Multi disciplinary Advisory\nTeam ( Eamat).\nReacting on the possibility of\npostponing the meeting, Unicefs\nliaison officer to the OAU and\nUneca, Mrs Fatima Bahri blamed\n\"traditional African courtesy\" for\nthe crisis.\n\"The problem is that the host\nwill have to accommodate, feed\nand cater for the transport of the\n.delegates. his must not be because\nmost delegations draw per\ndiem from their governments,\"\nsays the Algerian, adding \"those\nunable to pay have the option of\nsoliciting for grants.\n- An IRIS Feature\nDr Salim: To present' papers"}
