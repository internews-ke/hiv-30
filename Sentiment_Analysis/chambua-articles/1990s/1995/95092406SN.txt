{"text": "'Angel of Death' and the fear of God in Irishmen\nBy KWENDO OPANGA\nThere is this thing about sex. They say\nthose who do it often do not even talk\nabout it. Those who talk about it often\ndo not do it often. So when a Catholic\npriest starts talking about it, there is\nsomething the matter and it is bound to\n.attract a great deal of interest - locally\nand internationally.\nFather Michael Kennedy must have\nthought he was doing his Irish town of\nDungarvan a mighty favour when he\ntalked about an Angel of Death on a\nrecent Sunday. He scared Ireland stiff\nand aroused the interest of the media,\ndoctors, researchers and just about everybody\nelse on the island, across the\nwater in the UK, across the channel on\nthe continent and across the Atlantic in\nAmerica.\nAccording to Fr Kennedy, sometime\nlast October, an English woman who\ncarries the Aids-causing HIV virus arrived\nin this South Ireland town on a\ndeadly mission. She was out to infect as\nmany men as possible with the virus.\nIt would appear she was very determined,\nhad great strength and must\nhave been good looking with a sweet\ntongue to match, for, the story goes,\nbetween October and April, she had\nbedded 80 men!\nBy all accounts, that is a rich harvest\nand it would appear it was sufficient\nreason for the Angel of Death to\ndisappear.\nThe way Fr Kennedy told it from his\npulpit, a young man had gone to him\nand confessed to having had sex with\nthe angel and that not long afterwards,\nat least four other young men also called\nat his home to tell the same story.\nObviously because he is the keeper of\nhis brother, Fr Kennedy found it incumbent\nupon him to go and talk to the\nAngel of Death.\nHe said .he visited her at least eight\ntimes. She confessed to having Aids and\nto being on a mission of revenge against\nthe male of the species. The good father\ndid not divulge the name of the avenging\nangel.\nBut he need not have said more. The\nfear of Aids spreads faster than the disease\nand one need only think of the fact\nthat the affected 80 men could have\n'slept with other women for the message\nto sink home - folks, we are on Death\nRow!\nObviously, the Father does not read\nthe words on his mantelpiece which\nhave a message for all and sundry, but\nwhich our politicians would ignore. It\nreads: \"Oh Lord, may my words be\nsweet and tender for tomorrow I may\nhave- to eat them.\"\nNow, like Richard Pryor, Fr Kennedy\nis some kind of hero in some kind of comedy about some kind of angel about\nsome kind of mess. The issue is that\nnobody believes him. In fact, he is being\n.discredited. He is being asked questions\nhe did not imagine would come his way.\nHe is being called a scare-monger by the\nmedia and by medics.\nWitness this from the right wing Daily\nExpress: \"The Kennedy in question,\nit emerged, was a Sinn Fein councillor, a\nsporting hero and although only a\nfourth cousin, a fully-fledged member of\nthe Irish-American dynasty ... and just\nlike the rest of the clan, (JFK, Bobby\nand Ted) he seems to have inherited the\nunerring ability to thrust himself into\nthe public eye.\"\nYou get the drift, don't you? He is in a\nway linked to Sinn Fein, the political\narm of the Irish Republican Army\n(IRA). Can he be trusted? He is a cousin\nof the Kennedy's and therefore? He is\none who seeks controversy and\npublicity.\nLet the Express give it to you\nstraight: \"The man who could never\nhave been a typically anonymous parish\npriest first came to be noticed outside\nIreland 18 months ago ... Everyday at\nthe successful appeal of Paul Hill - one\nof the Guilford Four - against the murder\nof a former British soldier, Father\nKennedy escorted Ethel Kennedy, the\nmother of Hill's wife Courtnye, into Belfast's\nRoyal Court of Justice.\"\nFine. 'And what about the experts,\nwhat are they saying about the Father's claims? The UK papers say experts believe it is almost impossible for a women to pass the virus onto partners in one'\noff sexual encounters ..\nTherefore, say the Guardian and the\nExpress, \"it is unlikely that all the men\nare infected.\"\nThe experts, we are told, say that unprotected\nsex is, twice as risky for a\nwoman than man. A woman will pass\nthe virus on to about a quarter of all\nmen she sleeps with, compared to 32 per\ncent of a man's. She would also have to\nhave sex between 500 and 1,000 times to\ninfect a lover.\nThere is more. The Guardian quotes\nDr James Walsh, Ireland's national Aids\n'co-ordinator, as saying that \"the current\nmedical understanding put the likelihood\nof a woman infecting a man on'\nfirst contact as low as 500-1.\" In fact, Dr\nWalsh said, that was a conservative estimate.\nOthers put it as a high as 1,000-1.\nThe point emerging from this is that\nit would be highly unlikely for a woman\nto infect so many men with the HIV\nvirus. Did Father Kennedy know this\nNo, he did not. In fact, he says, he have\nno scientific knowledge of Aids and the\nmuch or little he knows is what he acquired\nat a seminar, which lasted half a\nday.\nI am reminded that since I came here\nlast October, for very different reasons\nfrom our Angel, I have never seen figures\nof Aids sufferers published. We\npublish those figures regularly at home.\nSuppose it was Bishop Ndingi Mwana\na' Nzeki who had made such claims\nabout Olenguruone: Would the UK\nPress have treated the outspoken prelate\nthe way it is treating Fr Kennedy?\nLastly, was Fr Kennedy wrong in warning\nhis flock about the Angel of Death.\nI can only confidently answer the last\nquestion. The Father was right to alert\nthe community about the Angel of\nDeath, but wrong to come up with that\nfigure. He would have been safe from\nthe ridicule he is now enduring if he had\nquoted the five men who confessed to'\nhim.\nAll it would have taken to have an\nalmost similar effect is for those who\ntalk about sex often to imagine that\neach of the five men has had sex with\nmore than one partner and that these\npartners are active too. Just as the Father's\nclaims are scaring, so also are the\nviews of the experts that one can have a\none-night stand and get away with it a\ncushion for the adventurers, but can\nthey be sure?\nFather Kennedy could have avoided\nthis fine mess if he had taken a leaf\nfrom Mr Mwai Kibaki who, when Minister\nfor Health, underscored the seriousness\nof the issue thus: \"Aids is 100\nper cent fatal kwa hivyo watu waache\nktuU.in'gratan: Period\n\n'Fr Kennedy is\nsome kind of\n.hero in some\nkind of\n~omedy about\nsome kind of\nangel in some\nkind of mess.\nThe issue is\nthat nobody\nbelieves him'."}
