{"text": "Writer got my facts wrong\nI refer to an article appearing in\nthe Nation of February 8, on\n'Luo women too poor to reject\nunsafe sex'. While I did highlight\npoverty as one of the causes of\nthe Aids epidemic among the\nLuos, I made the context of the\nargument very specific.\nIt was unfortunate that the reporter\nchose to ignore the context\nand therefore got wrong interpretation\nof my argument\nWhat I said was that Luo women\nare poor due to the patrilineal\nand patrilocal systems which\ndeny them rights on children\nland and other property.\nThey would neither be accepted\nback by their parents in event\nof divorce or separation, nor respected\nby the society. They\nwould lose the burial place and of\ncourse they cannot put up\nmatrilocal homes. They thus\nhave no decision-making power\nover marital matters. Their fears\nand limitations render them unable\nto divorce or separate even if\nthings cannot work.\nThe reporter ignored other\nAids causative factors that I\nbrought out. My argument was\nthat the main problem is the\nprevalence of untreated ulcerating\nSTDs that serve as inlets to\nHIV. Further the prevalence of\nthe ulcerating STDs is accentuated\nby non-circumcision of the\nLuo males. There is proven high\nrates of sero-conversion among\nnon-circumcised males with genital\nulcer diseases.\n. Kawango Agot,\nEldoret."}
