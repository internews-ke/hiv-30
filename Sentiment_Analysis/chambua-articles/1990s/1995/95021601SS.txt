Pr-ostltutes\n.11n~drivers\nLong distance drivers stop for a lunch break: In a recent study it was found that 30 per cent of truck drivers had HIV infection partly because many of them engaged in casual sex without using condoms.\n\nsince its .emergence in'\n. the early 198Os, Aids\nhas become the African\ncontinent's. biggest\nhealth threat. It is already the number one kill among adults in some sub-Saharan countries. \nWorld Health Organisation:\nestimates that by the year\n2000, 40 million people worldwide will be \ninfected with Aids or HIV,\nthe human immunodeficiency virus\nthat triggers the killer disease.\nOf those, 25 million will be\nin Africa. Thus, Africa appears destined\n.to continue to bear a\ndisproportionate share of the\nAids epidemic.\nIn this environment, IDRC is\nSupporting a collaborative reseach\neffort by the University of\nNairobi and the University of\nManitoba .intended to find ways to protect\ncertain vulnerable groups.\nThe team of African, Canadian\nand European researchers is led\nby the University of Nairobi's Dr\nJ. O. Ndinya -Achola and the University of Manitoba's Dr Frank\nPlummer..\nDoctor Plummer, a Winnipeg\n\u00b7native has conducted research on \nAids from a base in Nairobi for\nsome .' years. Over that period:, .\nthe research has .included studies\nfocusing on three .diverse but import groups affected by Aids:\nSex workers (prostitutes), children and  long-distance truck\n.drivers.\nDr Plummer's collaborators in\nthe 70\u00b7 person team have become \none of  the most prominent Aids\nresearch groups in the world and\ncertainly . the best known research\nteam in Africa. '\nSome Of their most remarkable\nfinding\u00b7 to date have emerged from \nastudy of 1,700 Nairobi sex\nworkers, 95 per cent of whom\nhave Aids or are infected with\nHIV,\nThe researchers are trying to\ndetermine why 'the remaining uninfected.\nfive per cent - whose\nbehaviour is 'apparently no different from that of their cohort -\nhave not acquired the disease.\n\"We're very interested in how\nthey resist HIV infection,\" says\nDr Plummer .\nSomething makes the Aids-resistant\nsex workers special.\n\"We're pretty sure they're resistant\nto HIV in some way,\" says\nDr Plummer. \"They \u00b7could have\"\ncellular Immunity to HIV.\nThere's something about their\nwhite blood cells that kills the\ndisease.\"\nFinding the answer could mean .\na cure, or at least a vaccination,\nfor Aids. \"It's the best clue in\ndetermining if there is a natural .\nimmunity,\" he says.\n. Dr Joanne Embree of the University\nof Manitoba's Medical\nMicro-biology ~d Pediatrics Departmlmt,\nsays: \"If the prostitutes\nhave an immune defence\nmechanism, then you're well on\nyour way to finding something to\ncure it or at least minimise the\neffect of Aids.\" And if researchers\ndetermine the women are genetically\nimmune to the virus, \"we\ncan look at gene therapy or something\nto block the (genetic)\nreceptor.\nThe group is also trying to determine\nthe role of breast milk in\nHIV transmission between mother\nand baby. Out of 500 children\nof HIV-positive mothers, 47 per\u00b7\ncent were infected with the virus.\nHalf of those children were infected\nthrough breast feeding.\n\"That's an incredibly important\nissue,\" says Dr Plummer. Breast feeding is almost universal\nin Africa.\" And for impoverished\nwomen, without the resources to\nbuy food or provide clean water,\nthere is no alternative to breast\nfeeding to nourish an infant.\nEven if there .were a choice, the\nbenefits of breast feeding in developing\ncountries cannot be\noverlooked. They are vital to the\nhealth of the child in the first few\nyears in the prevention of disease,\nparticularly potentially fatal\ndiarrhoeal diseases ...\nThis study is not yet complete,\nbut already the researchers think\nthat a three to six-month period\nof breast feeding rather than the\nsuggested two years may be a better\npractice for HIV positive\nmothers ..\nThe researchers hope that a\nshorter period of .breast feeding\nwill lower the transmission rate\nof HIV while still giving the babies\nthe necessary immunities to\nfight other diseases.\nPlummer says the research\ngroup initially focused mainly on\nwomen and children. Little research\nwas directed toward hard to-\nreach men. Then, as part of a\nstudy led by- the Kenyan .researcher-\nDr J. J. Bwayo, they set up a roadside clinic near a police checkpoint to contact truck drivers,\nwho generally have a high\nfrequency of HIV and other sexually\ntransmitted diseases. _\n\"There is a lot of HIV along\nthe truck routes,\" says Dr\nPlummer. They are a mobile population\nwho play an important role\nin the geographic spread of\nIV.\nIt has even been suggested that\nlong distance truck drivers may,\nn part, be responsible for introducing\nHIV to Kenya from\nneighbouring countries.\nOf the 800 men in the study,\nabout 30 per cent have HIV, a\n19ure that is growing by about\nour per cent a year.\nDr Plummer calls the roadside\nbarrs and truck stops that the\ndrivers frequent \"little HIV factories\".\nResearch has shown a\nhigher prevalence of HIV in\ntowns near major highways than\nin nearby towns further from the\nroad. ,\nIn 1990, the project interviewed 350 long distance truckers. Despite having adequate\nknowledge of Aids and other sexually\ntransmitted diseases, 80 per\ncent reported having had unprotect\nsex with prostitutes within\nthe previous year and 25 per cent reported weekly sex with prostitutes. Only 10 per cent had ever\nused a condom.\n. The roadside clinic attempts to\nchange attitudes about unprotected\nsex. While drivers wait for\npolice to check their rigs, they are\noffered HIV tests as' well' as\ncondoms, education and\ncounselling.' _.\n\"Almost everybody in Kenya\nand Africa knows about HIV  but\nthey don't do what they ought\nto,' says Dr Plummer. \"We're\ntrying to understand the impediments\nto translating knowledge\nto safer behaviour,\"\nIf Aids continues at its current\npace, \"within 10 to 15years you'll\nbe able to see effects on population\ngrowth,\" says Dr Plummer.\n\"There'll be negative population\ngrowth. Right now 15 per cent of the general population\n. have HV in Kenya. When 15 per\ncent of your workforce has a fatal\ndisease, that's pretty important.\"\nExacerbating the health crisis\nare governments too poor or too\nslow to combat the problems. Annual\nhealth-care spending\namounts to only about $6 for every\nman, woman and child in sub-Saharan Africa, according to the\nWorld Development Report. Government's are not putting.\nenough money or resources into\nthe problem of Aids,\" says Dr\nPlummer. \"They can't hope to\ncope with the problem with the\nmoney they .have right. now.\"\nThe research by the Kenyan-\nCanadian team, along with the\neducational and counselling components,\nhas made a considerable\ncontribution to slowing the transmission\nof sexually transmitted\ndiseases in Kenya and beyond.\n\"We've helped a lot of people\nalong the way. We've prevented\ncountless HIV infections,\" Says\nthe doctor.\nBut the research programme\nhas had other important results\napart from its findings on sexually\ntransmitted diseases. From\nmodest beginnings, when\nPlummer and one or two Kenyan\ncolleagues worked on small studies,\nit has grown into a sophisticated,\nworld-renowned-' research\nteam. Sixty members of the 70-\nperson team are Kenyans.\n\"We've built the human resources\nto begin to deal with this\nproblem,\" says Dr\u00b7 Plummer.\n\u00b7Reprinted from IDRC"}
