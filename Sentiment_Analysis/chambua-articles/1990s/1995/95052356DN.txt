{"text": "MAY 23, 1995\nExpert says AIDS deaths to skyrocket\nBy NATION Reporters\u2028\nHalf the deaths in some countries of Africa will be caused by Aids by the year 2010, an international workshop in Nairobi was told yesterday.\u2028\nDr. Karen Stanecki of the US Census Bureau said population projections produced by the Census Bureau last year revealed that the spread of the virus in Africa would have a great impact on the life expectancy on the continent in future.\u2028\nShe was addressing an international workshop on the integration of HIV/Aids programmes into family planning programmes at the Safari Park Hotel.\u2028\nDr. Stanecki said the impact of Aids on Africa would be enormous because the HIV virus mainly affects significant age groups, mainly in the under 20-24 age group for women and 25-35 age group for men.\u2028\nShe projected that while infant mortality was expected to double in Zaire and Zambia, in Kenya it was expected to increase five fold. \u201cAlthough Africa will see an increased population growth rate, this be diminished by the impact of the disease.\u201d\u2028\nDr. Stanecki said there were different varieties of the Aids virus in Africa depending on whether one was dealing with a rural or urban population. While East, Central and Southern parts of Africa were mainly affected by the HIV virus, West Africa was mainly assailed by the HIV 2 virus.\u2028\nThe president of the International Planned Parenthood Federation. Dr. Fred Sai, said family planning programmes could and should be a useful resource in HIV/Aids prevention.\u2028\nDr. Sai, who presented the key note address, said family planning and HIV/Aids programme integration was absolutely necessary in Africa today. \u201cFamily planning and STDs/HIV integration operational planning efforts should be undertaken jointly.\u201d \u2028\nHe said African countries should, as a matter of urgency, draw up their own agenda on Aids given the rapidly increasing prevalence of Hl V/Aids epidemic on the continent. However, the African agenda should be based on the people\u2019s perceptions of their needs and how they should be satisfied.\u2028\nHe said there was a need for an expeditious solution to be sought for the problem in Africa given the fact that \u201c18 million adults and about 18 million children have been affected since the start of the Aids epidemic.\u2028\n\u2018Sub-Saharan Africa alone is estimated to have 11 million cases and accounts for some 70 percent of Aids cases so far.\u201d\u2028\nThe workshop, whose theme is Setting the Agenda for Africa, is attended by representatives from USA, Thailand and 19 African countries.\u2028\nThe workshop was sponsored by the US Agency for International Development under a contract with Basic Support form institutionalizing Child Survival and in partnership with Path finder International. It will develop the \u201cdos\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019ts\u201d of integrating services.\u2028\nDr. Julia Walsh of Harvard University said integration was the answer to dealing with the Aids problem. With the magnitude of the problem, she argued, countries had no choice but look at cross-border solutions.\u2028\nHealth Minister Joshua Angatia told the workshop there was an urgent need to formulate a regional agenda for the integration of STD/HIV services into the existing maternal child health and family planning services.\u2028\nHe made the remarks in a speech read on his behalf by an Assistant Minister in the Ministry, Mr. Basil Criticos.\u2028\nMr. Angatia said sub-Saharan Africa in particular faced the worst crisis than ever before of scarce resources and formidable health problems.\u2028\nIn his official opening address, the Minister said HIV/Aids presented a relatively new health problem to the region, resulting into the review of traditionally priority health sectors by governments."}
