{"text": "Who understands Luo culture?\nMy attention has been drawn to\nyour daily issue of November 13 in\nwhich you quoted Lady Justice\nOwuor on Luo culture. As a member\nof\" Abila or Duol\" Luo elders\nforum), I am duty-bound to put the\nrecord right.\n. Our traditional culture is a long\nstanding series better known to Luo\nalone. Despite learning the language,\nnon-Luos may not understand\nit properly.\nFor instance, a widow who\nwould like to live without suspicion\namong her close relatives and have\nher young ones do the same must be\nmarried by one of her brothers in law.\nIn other words, wife inheritance\nis here to stay among the Luo.\nBy so doing, the widow is definitely clean and free to mingle with others\nand participate in social activities\nfearlessly. She is free to hold a feast\nand serve guests. Non-Luo women\nmarried to Luos are Luo\" and\nmust follow suit in this tradition.\nToday, the person to inherit must be\ntested for Aids first. I agree with\nthe school of thought that there are\ntraditions that do not suit the present society. For example. young\nLuo men and women no longer extract\ntheir six lower teeth.\nNo Luo elders sat down at any\nforum to discuss aspects of culture\nto be discarded (Ng'ado guok). The\npresent clan elders do not wear ornaments\naround their earlobes.\nOlwal Okech,\nKendu Bay.\nStatistics on Aids confusing\nUnlike other PTA countries, Kenya\nlags behind in its campaign against\nAids. Over the past one year, all\nsorts of contradicting and frightening\nstatistics have been issued.\nWhatever the statistics, it should\nsuffice to know that 25 per cent of\nall donated blood is HIV positive.\nChilling, isn't it? Aids scourge will\novertake famine and war in the next\nfour years as a national catastrophe.\nWhere did we, as a nation, fail? Is it\ntoo late to polish our image? As\nyour paper has pointed out in the recent\npast, our political leaders, who\nare the main opinion shapers, have\nfailed miserably. And so have our\nreligious leaders. If our leaders and\nmoral guides were to start an\nawareness \u2013campaign the' message\nwould traverse 'our national. landscape\nfaster than the multi-party craze a few years ago.\nPresently, when Aids strikes it is\nan individual family that takes the\nfirst blow. It should be at this level\nthat the message must take effect.\nSince most of us are shy to openly\ndiscuss sex, it becomes more difficult\nto discuss sex-related maladies\nat family level. But somehow, the\nmessage has to start at the family\nlevel.\nFor a start, the radio and TV are\nthe best initiators of the campaign.\nIf it can be done on the same level\nas the present traffic up-date and as\n, frequently, the message will start\ngetting home. Posters in social\n,halls, places of entertainment and\nchurches would also pass on the\nmessage. \nMwangi Kagilnda\nNairobi"}
