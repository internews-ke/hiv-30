{"text": "Prisons conditions need verification \\\nThere's an urgent need to open up Kenyan prisons. No, not to let out all those legally and rightfully incarcerated for crimes committed against society. We are referring to the frequent reports of poor conditions in the prisons and remand homes which in recent months have been exacerbated by deaths of inmates or people coming out of these confinements looking emaciated or sickly.\nSources yesterday said that due to the extremely poor conditions of prisons and remand homes in Kenya an average of four prisoners die each day in one prison alone. Congestion and lack of medical attention were cited as the factors in the poor health conditions.\nHardly a month has passed since one inmate released from the Nairobi remand home died within a few days of being set free by a court without formally being charged allegedly for having been found in possession of bhang. Within the eight months in which he was at the remand home, this suspect wasted away so rapidly that he was a skeleton of his former self by the time he was released.\nThe Opposition has demanded that a Parliamentary Select Committee be instituted immediately to probe conditions in prisons to avert further 10ss of human life.\nThe Opposition politicians criticised the Government for its alleged insensitivity to the suffering of prisoners and suspects who were living under unhygienic and overcrowded conditions. As of last August, these institutions held over 30,000 people.\nWhile acknowledging an increase in death rates, the\nCommissioner of Prisons, Mr Edward Lopokoyit denied that this was due to congestion. He said the increase in deaths of prisoners especially in western Kenya was due to the HIV /Aids phenomenon.\nMr Lopokoyit talked of a number of amenities that the prisons offer inmates including accessibility to relatives and freedom to be treated in private hospitals or by personal doctors.\nAgainst the welter of complaints, Mr Lopokoyit's disclosure of these privileges must come as surprise news to many. The prisons authorities can go one step further and allow independent sources to visit the prisons and remand homes to verify these reports."}
