{"text": "Women's vulnerability to HIV 'increasing'\n\nWomen face the bleak reality of being infected by the deadly HIV virus more quickly than men, due in part to their economic dependence on men, the World Health Organisation said.\n\n\"The number of infected women with HIV is increasing more rapidly than men in Africa, in southern Asia,\" Hiroshi Nakajima, WHO's director-general, told a news\nconference.\n\n\"The bleak reality is that the sexual and economic subordination of women fuels the HIV/Aids pandemic,\" WHO said in its position paper at the Conference.\n\n\"Women's vulnerability ...is linked to their low status in society and their economic, cultural and social dependence on their male partners.\"\n\nWomen were almost absent from the pandemic in 1980 of the HIV virus that can cause Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (Aids), but now total as many as eight million. Some one million more are infected each year, mainly through unprotected sexual intercourse, WHO said. Every minute, two women are infected with HIV. And every two minutes, a woman dies of Aids.\n\nWHO said the number of women infected with HIV will have reached 14 million by the year 2000, and about four million will have died.\n\nStudies in some countries show that up to 30 per cent of HIV infections are occurring in women whose only risk behavior is sexual intercourse with a single male partner who in turn has had or continued to have unprotected sex with other partners.\n\nProviding women, especially young women, with the personal skills and confidence to refuse sex when they do not want it was essential to battling the pandemic. \n\nHowever, women at a grassroots forum on the outskirts of\nBeijing that is running parallel to the UN conference said WHO was following the wrong policies to combat the disease.\n\nThey called for rapid development of microbicides that women could use to combat the deadly HIV virus, instead of relying on male partners often reluctant to use condoms.\n\n\"The strategy of the WHO against Aids is not working and is irrelevant to the women of Africa,\" said Priscilla Misihairabwi, co-ordinator of the Women and Aids support network of Harare, Zimbabwe. \"One in four sexually active women in Zimbabwe is HIV -infected. The situation is catastrophic. It is a life and death issue. Africanwomen want to try microbicides.\"\n\nMicrobicides are inserted into the vagina like spermicides and would be able to kill the HIV virus carried in the sperm of their male partner.\n\nLori Heise, of WHAM, Women's Health Advocates on Microbicides, told the seminar that 10 different microbicides were in the development stage and that it would take a further five years before they became commercial products.
