{"text": "MONDAY MAY 15 1995\n\nNew test for\u2028\nHIV approved\u2028\n By SHACKlE TAUHO\u2028\n Samples of saliva and other oral fluids can now be used to detect the presence of Human Immuno defiiciey Virus (HIV), the virus that causes Aids, a medical scientific journal says.\u2028\nThe African Journal for Medical practice says the Food and Drug Administration of the United States has announced it has approved the first US HIV test system using oral fluids samples. Until now,\nHIV tests have used blood sample, \nThe disclosure will be of major interest to developing countries where the cost of HIV test is proving: prohibitive in terms of equipment and maintenance costs.\nLocal HIV tests are currently done using Enzyme Linked\nImmunosorbent Assay (ELISA)\nTests or Rapid Assay test approved by the Ministry of Health, on blood samples obtained from patients for diagnosis or from samples of donated blood before it is transfused. HIV test reagents are obtained from manufacturers abroad based on the World Health Organisation approved standards.\nAlthough the journal says the\nnew test is not as accurate as the approved HIV tests using blood studies indicate that fur every\n100 people infected with HIV, the oral HIV test will miss only  one or two.\nThe FDA has also approved both a product for collecting specimens of oral fluid and a specific test used to analyse the specimens for the presence of HIV. However, the use of the specimen collection product is subject to several restrictions.\nThe restriction are to availability for purchase and distribution only through physicians, proper training of individuals administering it, and it must not be provided to people for home use.\nOther restrictions are that the test system may be used for diagnosis\nOnly and must not be used to screen blood donors.\nThe test system is intended for use in people over 13 years of age, and includes a specially treated cotton pad on a stick and preservative solution in a plastic container.\nA trained collector instructs a person to place the pad between the lower gum and the cheek to, obtain a sample of oral fluid. The\npad is then stored in the preservative until the sample is processed and analysed using an\nELISA test specifically licensed for testing oral samples."}
