A few days later, rumours\nstart doing the rounds, especially\nat the work place that\nthe person is HIV positive.\nWhere do these rumours start\nfrom? Why can't the person be\ntold that he is HIV positive direct\nfrom hospital? It is upon the\nmedical personnel to ensure that\nfamilies are informed about their\nHIV status to avoid other problems\ncaused by ignorance.\n\"Concerned Citizen\"\nNyeri"}
