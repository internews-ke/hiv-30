{"text": "Can athletes contract HIV virus during competition?\nSwimmer Greg Louganis' announcement last month that he was HIV positive raised new questions about the probability of contracting Aids during competition.\nIn the 1988 Seoul Olympics, the world froze before their television sets when millions of viewers watched Louganis hit the diving board with his head, opening up a deep gash that left him bleeding profusely.\nThe swimmer received several stitches by the poolside from a doctor who was not wearing gloves, then took to the diving board again and went on to win both the platform and springboard gold medals, The world applauded this brave man's feat.\nSo when Louganis announced to the world that he knew he had been HIV positive six months before he made that dive, the world was stunned.\nIn his recently published autobiography, Breaking the Surface, Louganis says had not told the doctor who treated him about his condition and apologized to the medic for failing to inform him that he was HIV positive in Seoul. The doctor, who was tested for the virus two weeks ago and found to be HIV negative, forgave Louganis for his sins of omission,\nHowever, that episode has raised questions about competition and Aids.\nFor all the blood spilled in wrestling and rugby, the likeliest place for an athlete to get Aids is in bed. Magic Johnson believes he was exposed to HIV during unprotected sex with one of his hundreds of female admirers.\nBeing splattered by boxer's bloody nose poses an infinitesimal chance of infection compared with unsafe sex.\nThere are no known cases of HIV infection through sports. You need direct exposure of an open wound to infected blood, one doctor says.\nThat is why Louganis' blood in the Olympic pool posed very little risk.\nThe blood was diluted by thousands of gallons of water and chlorine kills HIV.\nEven violent sports pose little threat of HIV.\nOne study shows that there are almost four bleeding injuries in a game of American football but the risk of HIV transmission is less than one in one million.\n(The risk from unprotected sex with a woman is greater than 1 in 400, the study says).\nMost amateur sports associations do not test for HIV. However, some sports organisations ask referees to disqualify an athlete with an open sore in a sport with extensive skin-to-skin contact like wrestling.\nIn Kenya, there could be a higher risk in a sport like boxing where boxers at times share gum shields.\nPerhaps, it is about time the Amateur Boxing Association of Kenya spelt out the grave danger this poses to boxers,\nFRED WAGA"}
