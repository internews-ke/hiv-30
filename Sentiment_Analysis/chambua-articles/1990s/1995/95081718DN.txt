{"text": "Aids: Cure being sought in baboons' bone marrow\nWASHINGTON, Wednesday\nThe US Government has approved\na novel experiment to inject\nbaboon bone marrow cells\ninto an Aids patient to see if they\nhelp rebuild his ravaged immune\nsystem.\nThe US Food and Drug Administration\nconfirmed on Monday\nthat it authorised the study\nto go ahead. Researchers are\nawaiting final. safety clearance\nfrom a hospital and expect to\nperform the experiment in October, said Dr Steve Deeks of the University of California, San\nFrancisco, who will perform the\noperation.\nHiv, the aids virus, destroys\nthe body's immune system until patients can no longer fight off\ninfections.\nBone marrow contains stem\ncells that manufacture the body's\nblood cells, including immune\ncells. The theory is that baboon stem cells - which do not get infected\nwith HIV - might help repopulate\na human's blood with\nimmune cells.\nA Food and Drug Administration\nadvisory committee warned\nlast month the operation probably\nwould kill the recipient and\nmust be carefully controlled to\nensure that diseases baboons\ncarry don't spread \u00b7to humans.\nBut the committee recommended\ngoing ahead to prove whether baboons\nhold a key to fighting Aids.\n(AP)"}
