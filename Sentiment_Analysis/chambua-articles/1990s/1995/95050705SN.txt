Tests to be used\nmust not have false positivity or\nnegativity results.\"\nThe President of Biotech, Mr\nBrendan Farrell, said the \"rapid\ntest kit' could show HIV status in\neight minutes.\nThe kit was developed six\nmonths ago in Ireland and was\nbeing used in Asia and parts of\nEurope. Kenya is the first African\ncountry to acquire it.\nMr Farrell said the kit had\nbeen tested using samples from\nall over the world including\nKenya and its accuracy placed at\n99 per cent.\nThe kit, to be marketed by\nTrinity Pharma Limited, has yet to be locally priced, but Mr Farrell\nsaid a complete kit set with\n40 testing-apparatus costs $ 320\n(Sh15,040). In Ireland, an individual\npays $8 (Sh376) per test.\nAccording to a local Aids expert,\nDr Mboya Okeyo, the cumulative\ntotal of reported Aids cases\nas at April 21 was 56,573.\nThe number is expected to rise\ndrastically over the next few\nyears.\nHe said the reasons for the increase\nwere mainly lack of resources\nfor Aids research and\nslow rate of change of behaviour.\nHe said $1,400 million were\nspent on Aids research\nworldwide."}
