{"text": "Aids: 2 Kenyans die daily\nBy KURGAT MARINDANY\nTwo people die of Aids in Kenya\nevery day, an expert said yesterday.\nDr .Martin Kayo, the National\nAids Control Programme boss, also\nsaid that Africa had 70 per cent of\nall HIV/Aids cases in the world.\nSocial and economic problems,\npoverty and civil wars in parts of\nAfrica, Dr Kayo said, had contributed\nto the \"wild spread\" of HIV/\nAids.\nHe was answering questions from journalists at InterContinental, Nairobi, after the official\nlaunching of a video film, The Silent Epidemic, on Wednesday night.\nThe film, produced by local media\npersonality Raphael Tuju, aims\nto create awareness among sexually\nactive people about the dangers of\nsexually transmitted diseases\n(STDs), particularly the role they\nplay in the transmission of the HIV\nvirus which causes Aids.\nThe Director of Medical Services,\nDr James Mwanzia, presided\nover the launch. lie said recent  studies from the Kenya National\nAids and STDs Control Programme\n(NASCOP) had shown that ulcerative\nsexually transmitted diseases\nincreased the transmission rate of\nAids by 15 and 27 times.\nUlcerative STDs, he said, include\nchancroid and syphilis. The\npresence of non-ulcerative STDs\nlike gonorrhoea increased the transmission\nrate of the Aids virus by\nfour to eight times.\nCurrent surveillance statistics from NASCOP showed that HIV\nprevalence among people with\nSTDs was three times higher than\nthat in the general population ..\nThere was evidence that STDs\nplayed a major role in the spread of\nAids and that people infected with\nSTDs were more likely to have HIV\ninfection.\nRecent evidence from research\nconducted in Mwanza, Tanzania\nand published in the Lancet magazine,\nan authoritative medical publication, gives a new insight into the\nfight against Aids. It has been shown that investing\nin early STD treatment and control\ncan reduce HIV prevalence by as\nmuch as 40 per cent.\nThe Government, Dr Mwanzia\nsaid, planned to emphasise early treatment\nand prevention of STDs\nas a strategy for fighting Aids.\nOver the next five years, the Government would also strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of\nHealth to meet the challenges of\neducating Kenyans on STDs and\nAids. \nAfrica has 70pc of HIV cases-expert"}
