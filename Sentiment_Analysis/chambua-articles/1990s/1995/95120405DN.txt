He said the disease was spreading\nat an alarming rate in the\ndistrict.\nMore than 300 Aids cases were\nreported yearly. The positive cases,\nhe said, have been detected from\nonly blood donors.\nThe number of cases may be\nhigher because there was no district\nhospital and many patients had\nbeen admitted to hospitals outside the district where some of them had\ndied.\nThe Medical Superintendent at\nMaua Mission Hospital, Dr Lynn\nFogleman, said most of the Aids patients\nadmitted were miraa traders\nwho had been running their businesses\nin Nairobi, Mombasa and\nKisumu and other big towns. Most of the victims had refused\nto take their wives to the hospital\nfor medical check-ups to establish\nwhether they had also been infected.\nDr Fogleman said the hospital\nhad started a programme to train\nhome health care advisers in miraa\ngrowing areas to properly look after\nthe Aids patients."}
