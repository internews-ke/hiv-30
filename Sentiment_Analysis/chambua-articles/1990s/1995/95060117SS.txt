{"text": "Health facilities cause grave concern\nAs Mzee Jomo Kenyatta and his set of young and vibrant new Ministers, drove through Coronation Avenue (now Harambee Avenue) to take their oath of office on June 1, 32 years ago, many a Kenyan wept with joy for they knew that total independence was just a heart beat away.\nWith the coming of Madaraka, wananchi had been granted internal self-rule after 70 years of colonial domination.\nAn atmosphere of hope and expectation pervaded the air as each and every Kenyan looked forward to building a strong and healthy nation.\nNow, 32 years after the shouts of jubilation that marked this historic occasion died, many are now wondering if there was any cause for jubilation that beautiful Saturday on June 1, 1963.\nAlthough the new Government pledged to fight ignorance and disease, the majority of wananchi are now hard put as far as the payment of medical bills is concerned.\nThe sorry state of the country's health was aptly summed up by the Director of Medical Services,\nDr James Mwanzia, who said that over 50 per cent of Kenyans risked death by preventable diseases.\nSo mismanaged and disappointing is the health sector that one Member of Parliament aptly described the health system as totally \"unhealthy\".\nIt is sad to note that in this day and age when the world is boasting of great achievements in medicine, Kenya still has to contend with deaths from containable killers like malaria and bilharzia.\nIn addition, malnutrition and sanitation related diseases form a big proportion of the country's mortality rate.\nThe high prevalence of preventable diseases in Kenya is not only blamed on the Government's inability to provide adequate primary health care services, but also on the high level of illiteracy and general ignorance among the people. The country's health facilities suffer from lack of simple basic equipment, drugs and insufficient and demoralised staff.\nThe situation is so bad that in some cases, operations cannot be performed because of inavailability of gloves and sometimes lack of water.\nA visit to any of the country's public hospitals will reveal not only lack of medical assistance and help but one is most likely to find patients sleeping on beds without mattresses and sheets.\nMost affected are women and children. Infant and maternal mortality rates in the land attest to this.\nThe maternal mortality rate in Kenya currently stands at 28 per cent for firs-time mothers and 23 per cent for others.\nThe situation is worrying because 26 per cent of maternal deaths occur among adolescent mothers.\nThere is an urgent need to streamline the country's curative services so as to curb inefficiency and corruption.\nEarly this year, President Moi said that some Government doctors were behind the persistent drug shortages in public hospitals.\nThe distribution and dispensation of drugs and medical equipment to the public have remained a mystery.\nDespite the consistent reports from the Minister for Health, Mr Joshua Angatia, that drugs are regularly distributed to Government health facilities, most administrators in these institutions complain of lack of drugs and equipment.\nOne of the killers that is causing the Ministry great worry is Aids. \nThe HIV virus is spreading rapidly among the people with current figure for fully blown Aids estimated at over 53,000.\nRecent statistics given by an official of the US Census Bureau indicate that Kenya and 12 other countries in Africa face the danger of loosing at least half of their population to the killer by the year 2010.\nAlso of grave concern is the issue of the high costs of treatment in private hospitals. Drugs are also expensive.\nThe health situation in the country is made worse by numerous sanitation and widespread water shortages that face most urban residents.\nMany are forced to use untreated water from streams just to survive as their taps go dry days on end.\nBut all is not lost, Some tangible developments have been made in the last 32 years since that glorious day on June 1, 1963.\nApart from the increased number of medical centres; hospitals and clinics available even in the remotest parts of the country, a number of rural-based Kenyans receive medical attention through outreach services.\nThis has been made possible through the combined efforts of the Government, non governmental organisations and agencies like the United Nations Children's Fund.\nThere are also other messages of hope on the medical front. The rehabilitation of the heart unit at Kenyatta is one and a other is the announcement by the Health Minister last month that the entire Kenyatta National Hospital is going to be renovated.\n\nAn operation in one of the local hospitals: State health facilities suffer from lack of simple basic medical equipment, drugs and Insufficient and demoralised staff.\nThe situation is so bad that in some cases, operations cannot be performed because of inavailability of gloves and sometimes due to lack of water -' (File picture)"}
