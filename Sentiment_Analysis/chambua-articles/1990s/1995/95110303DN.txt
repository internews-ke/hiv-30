{"text": "FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 1995\n\n\nWomen \u2018more prone to Aids\u2019\u2028\n\nBy Nation Correspondent\u2028\n\nWomen are more prone to Aids than men, an Aids specialist said yesterday.\u2028\nDr Oduol, the chairman of Advisory Committee, Kenya Aids Non\u2028\nGovernmental Organisation Consortium, said research had established that the transmission of HIV virus which causes Aids was more effective from man to woman than from woman to man.\u2028\nHe said sexually-transmitted diseases among women also increased their risks of contracting Aids.\u2028\nDr Oduol said social and economic factors increased women\u2019s risks of contracting Aids. The imbalance of power between men and women in most cultural settings limits women\u2019s ability to protect themselves since many of them are forced to accept risky sexual partnerships, he said.\u2028\nDr Oduol was addressing an Aids Policy Workshop at the Isaack on Inn in Embu town said an estimated 70 per cent of women with 111V were between the ages of 14 and 24.\u2028\nLife expectancy is projected to decline from 59 to 43 years for men and 62 to 44 years for women by the year 2000, he added.\n\nDr Oduol said Kenya had 1,600 Aids orphans and added that the figure was expected to rise to 600,000 by the year 2000 and close to one million by the year 2005.\u2028\nAn estimated 30 to 40 percent of babies born to infected mothers also get infected with HIV and most of them develop Aids and die within two years.\u2028\nHe called for an HlV/Aids policy reform addressing social, cultural, and economic issues.\u2028\nThe seminar draws participants from Eastern Province."}
