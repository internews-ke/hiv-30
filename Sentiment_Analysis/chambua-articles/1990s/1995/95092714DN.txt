Glaxo\nWellcome's share price jumped\nby nearly two per cent before\nstabilising up 10 pence, 1.3 per\ncent above yesterday's close, at\n751 pence.\nThe so-called Delta trial, which\nstarted in 1992, involved more\nthan 3,000 people with HIV in\nBritain, Ireland, Australia,\nFrance, Germany, Italy, the\nNetherlands and Switzerland.\nThey were randomly assigned\none of three different treatments\n- AZT alone, AZT with\ndidanosine (pdl) or AZT with\nzalcitabine (ddC) - all similar\ndrugs that attack the virus's ability\nto work and replicate itself.\nOf the patients who had never\ntaken AZT before, 17 per cent\nwho took AZT alone died, compared\nwith 10 per cent who took\nAZT with ddl and 12 per cent\nwho took AZT with ddC. \"This\nrepresents a substantial benefit\nin favour of both combination\ntherapy regimes and, in light of\nthis, the trial has been stopped\nearly,\" the Medical Research\nCouncil, which helped oversee\nthe research, said in a statement.\nShare analysts said that another\nstudy in the United States, details\nof which were published earlier\nthis month, showed similar\nresults and they welcomed the\nconfirmation.
