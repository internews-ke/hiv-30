London\u2028\nScientists now believe that there is\u2028\nan outside chance of developing an\u2028\nAids vaccine in the future according to a report in the US journal,\u2028\nScience.\u2028\nThe report says that a mutant less\u2028\nvirulent strain of HIV has been dis\u2028\ncovered among a group of men in\u2028\nSydney, Australia, and has been\u2028\nstudied by a group of scientists led\u2028\nby Dr Nicholas Deacon.\u2028\nThe group of men, known as the\u2028\nSydney Blood Bank Cohort, first\u2028\nbecame infected by l-11V more than\u2028\nlO years ago as a result of blood\u2028\ntransfusions from a homosexual man.\u2028\nDespite becoming infected, none\u2028\nof those who became l-11V positive\u2028\nhave yet developed Aids.\u2028\n, The HIV virus in the Sydney\u2028\ngroup of men is said to have defect\u2028\nin various genetic elements, notably, a gene called nef, which has\u2028\nbeen shown in other studies to be\u2028\nneeded for the virus to replicate. As\u2028\na result the replication rate of the\u2028\nweakened virus is slowed down."}
