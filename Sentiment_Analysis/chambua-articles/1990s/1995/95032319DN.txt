{"text": "New HIV vaccine ready for trial\nBy SHACKEE TAURO\nThe World Health Organization\nheadquarters has given the green\nlight for large-scale trials of first\ngeneration HIV vaccine to test\nwhether the product can protect\nhumans from infections with\nHIV.\nGlobal Aidsnews, a publication of the Global Programme on\nAids (GPA) in Geneva,-says in its\nlatest edition that experts from\n10 countries gave the go ahead at\na meeting on Scientific and Public\nHealth Rationale for HIV\nVaccine Efficacy attended by\npublic health experts, scientists,\ncommunity and pharmaceutical\nindustry representatives.\nThe experts have considered\nthe safety of vaccines made from\ngenetically engineered forms of\nHIV's envelope protein as prerequisite\nto allowing the large-scale\ntrials. \nThe two' envelope vaccines,\nfurthest advanced in testing,\nhave been developed by Genetech\nand Biocine in California, United\nStates of America and have\nshown to be safe and immunogenic\nin smaller-scale (Phase I/II) human trials in the US.\n\nInfection\nThey have also been found to\nprotect chimpanzees from HIV\ninfection, but there is no certainty\nthat they will protect humans.\nThe only way to find out this is\nto conduct Phase III efficacy\ntrials.\nIn June last year, the United\nStates National Institute of Allergy\nand Infectious Diseases decided\nthat large-scale trials of the\nvaccine were not justified, in the\nUnited States of America. However,\nthe risk/benefit ratio is different\nin countries with larger\nepidemics.\nThe Chief of Vaccine Development\nat the GPA, Dr Jose\nEsparza, says the consensus at\nthe Geneva meeting that Phase\nIII trials were justified was based\non public health needs and the\nfeasibility of conducting the trials well as the scientific.\n\"The vaccines may work, and\neven if their efficacy, is low, we\nexpect to learn a lot, ' Dr Esparza\nsays. He added that in the worst\ncase, if the tests show that envelope\nprotein vaccines cannot protect people from infection, then\nattention could switch to alternatives\nsuch as live attenuated vaccines which could be explored."}
