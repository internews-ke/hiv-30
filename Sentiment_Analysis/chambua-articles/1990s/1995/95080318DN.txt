{"text": "Vaccine against HIV still a long way off\nBy ZEPHANIA UBWANI\nThe search for a vaccine against\nHIV which causes Aids is proving\nmore difficulties as more people\nin the developing countries, especially\nAfrica, continue to be infected\nwith the virus.\nIt is estimated that more\nthan 11 million of the estimated\n18 million HIV- infected adults in\nthe world are in Africa. Since\n1981, some 4.5 million people\nhave developed Aids.\nThe long search for a vaccine\nthat would protect people from\ninfection has proved more difficult\nthan expected, according to a report issued by the London based\nPamos Institute.\nThis has, among other things,\nmade some scientists to rethink\nof , strategy under which more\nconcentration would be on basic\nscience such as learning how the\ndisease damages the immune system\nand less on the narrow pursuit\nof vaccines and therapies.\n''The focus on drugs and vaccines\nmade sense a decade ago,\nbut it is time to acknowledge that\nour best efforts have not paid off\nand are not likely to do so,\"\nthe report quoted leading\nmolescular biologist in the United States.\nExperts have identified four main reasons why the vaccine search was still as elusive as ever.\nFirst, this virus was highly variable,\nnot just between the different subtypes but also within subtypes and even within infected\nindividuals.\nEqually difficult for the vaccine\ndesigner is that HIV can enter\nthe body hidden inside an infected\ncell. \"This puts it effectively out of reach of the immune system\" the 16 page report\nsays.\nIt said most of the people in the third world were infected by the virus through the mucus\nmembranes of the genital tract\nduring sexual intercourse, and\nnot through the bloodstream during\nblood transfusion or injection\nwith infected needles.\nThe immune response to infection\nconsists of two broad arms;\nantibodies. which attach themselves\nto the virus and block it\nout of cells, and T-cells which kill\ninfected cells. The report says\nmost scientists believe that both\narms of the system will be needed\nto protect against HIV.\n\"But so far, despite intensive efforts, no researchers have been\nable to pinpoint exactly which\nparts of the, immune response to\nHIV matter in protecting people\nfrom infection\" says the Panos\nreport titled \"Aids: Science at a crossroads\"\nAnother problem is lack of a\ngood \"animal model\" for experimental\npurposes on the vaccine\nvis-a-vis the virus itself.\nScientists the world over will\nusually study an infection and\nthe effect of an experimental vaccine\nin animals such as mice and\nmonkeys that can be infected develop similar or comparable symptoms to humans.\nThe animals can be vaccinated\nand deliberately exposed to the infection\nto find out whether the vaccine works. In the case of HIV however, the best model \u2026 macaque, infected with the an immunodeficiency (SIV).\n\"Chimpanzees can be infected with HIV, but because their intelligent, endangered and \u2026 species \n\u2026short and prohibitively expensive \u2026\nscientists are reluctant to use \u2026 Panos says."}
