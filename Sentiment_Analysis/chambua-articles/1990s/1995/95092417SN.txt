{"text": "THE TRUTH\nA STATEMENT BY THE UNIFICATION CHURCH OF KENYA\nINTRODUCTION\nIt is with honor, and sincere gratitude that we take this opportunity to congratulate the Catholic Church of Kenya, the wider Christian Church, the Government and the people of Kenya, for the successful and historical warm welcome to Head of the Roman Catholic Church, Pope John Paul II. The spirit of God is with us, bringing Love, Unity and Harmony transcending religious, cultural, racial, national and language barriers.\nWE SALUTE YOU, WANANCHI OF KENYA!\nPublic interest in the Unification Church has been aroused by the recent 360,000 Couples International Holy Blessing ceremonies conducted by the Reverend Sun Myung Moon and his representatives throughout the world on Friday, August 25, 1995.\nMany people have called us enquiring about who we are, what we are doing and why we conduct such international weddings. We have also read, with interest, various press reports, commentaries and letters to editors.\nThe Unification Church, is a transparent, public association. We wish to place on record the following facts about the\nReverend Sun Myung Moon, the Unification Church and the broader Unification Movement. We do so with the conviction that the general public will be better informed about us.\nWe wish the public to understand and appreciate the valuable contribution that the Reverend Moon and the\nUnification Movement are making in solving the REAL problems we are facing today. We ARE successfully managing these\nproblems through our education, our institutions and our lifestyle.\nA WORLD BESET BY PROBLEMS\nAIDS: Who has the solution to this problem? The spread of this disease is alarming. Unless a solution can be found\nurgently, the human community will be in crisis. The Unification Church is confidently offering a spiritual and physical\nformula to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS.\nWAR & HUNGER: Established religious institutions, for all their vigor and long-standing dedication, have not been able to\nprevent conflicts, war and hunger. The United Nations is celebrating its 50th anniversary with an unhappy report: for all its\nhuman and material resources, it can neither prevent war, nor can it effectively negotiate for lasting peace. Who will solve\nthe problem of War and Hunger?\nThe programme of the Unification Movement is laying the foundation to make war impossible. Our success will bring\nlasting peace to individuals, families, nations and the world. Our program for food production & distribution will, in the\ncourse of time, we are confident, significantly reduce the problem of world hunger.\nIMMORALITY & DIVORCE: Family breakdown is threatening the stability of our societies. Many families are staggering\nunder the weight of infidelity. Husbands cheat on their wives; wives cheat on their husbands. Children are cheating on\ntheir parents. Drug and alcohol abuse are leading to violence in the family. Single parents are increasing; children are\nbearing children! Street children are mushrooming; who can solve this problem?\nThe Unification teaching, called the Divine Principle, is keeping families together; Unification families have become a\nsubject of study by sociologists and family counselors because of our outstanding success in building Godly, stable,\nharmonious and loving families.\nCORRUPTION & CRIME have become commonplace in many societies. Despite public outrage, these vices continue\nunchecked. Will this go on without end? Where is hope of a just, honest, orderly and safe world to be found?\nTHE MISSION OF REVEREND SUN MYUNG MOON\nSun Myung Moon was born in 1920 in Korea. On Easter Morning, 1936 Jesus appeared to him while he was in deep prayer\non a Korean mountainside. Jesus called him to take responsibility in fulfilling the Will of God on Earth. Reverend Moon,\nupon accepting that calling, came to realize that the Will of God from time of creation was the building of the Kingdom of\nGod on Earth and in Heaven (Gen. 1:28; Heb. 8:10, Ezek. 36:26-27). Due to the Fall of the first human ancestors,\nhowever, sin and spiritual alienation became the affliction of humanity. (Rom. 7:19)\nIn brief, therefore, Reverend Moon's mission has been to eliminate sin and spiritual alienation from God and the\nsubsequent suffering of humanity. His, mission involves the establishment of Gods Kingdom on earth through Ideal\nindividuals and families. He says:\"The way to heaven is to broaden the scope of our love by loving the people in our\nhomes, by loving our neighbors, by loving our friends, relatives, clans, nations and the whole world::\nTHE DIVINE PRINCIPLE\nWhen the young Sun Myung Moon accepted the call of Jesus Christ, he sought to understand the Truth concerning many\nfundamental questions about God, the Universe, human history, the mission of Jesus, the Holy Trinity and others. In his\n_'ritual quest in prayer and intense study of religious. scriptures, he received many revelations from God, JEOsus and\nrical saints and sages. The content, of those revelations was systematlsed and pubished as the Deville Principle, the\nmessage of God today, 10 the \"~world through the Reverend Sun Myung Moon as a humble agent.\nFrom the beginning, Reverend Moon has understood his mission as that of unifying the Christian Church in order that\nthe Church can lead the world in fulfilling God's Will. (Dt. 10: 12) He presented himself and God's message to the Church\nat the earliest opportunity in the 1940s. He has persevered hardship until the present day when God's message is gaining\nrespect and acceptance among many leaders of established churches and religions.\n(a) Principles of The Creation\nThe Divine Principle has three main parts: the first part deals with the nature of God and why He created man and the\nuniverse. \"God himself told me that the most basic and central truth of this universe is that God is the Father and we are\nHis children. We are all created as the children of God ...\", Reverend Moon has said. God is our loving Parent. He created\nus so that we could live together sharing love and joy within His family. (1 In. 4:7).\nIt is for this reason that we were created in the image and likeness of God. (Gen. 1:20); Qur'an 15.29; I Ching 35: Progress)\nTHE 3 GREAT BLESSINGS\n1. Individual Perfection\nThe Principle explains that God made a straightforward statement about our Purpose of Life in Gen. 1:28. He\nproclaimed three blessings to man. The first was \"Be fruitful\" in which God required man to attain physical and spiritual\nmaturity; to be perfect In the likeness of God. (Matt 5:48) .\n2. The Ideal Family\nThe second was \"Multiply\". God desired to see a true man and a true woman marry and together raise sinless\nchildren. The children, raised by perfect parents, would also become true men and women. This would be the first true or\nideal family. The first couple would be True Parents. A sinless society and world of love would have emerged\nspeedily.(l)n. 3:9) The world would be one nation and humankind one family.\n3. Kingdom of Heaven\n\"Have Dominion\" is the third blessing. God created a wonderful environment of us to live in. With love and\ncompassion, we would interact with nature, creative.ly utilize~ nature's resources and enjoy life to !he fullest. We would use\nwisdom, science and technology to evolve a beautiful Social environment that would be the Kingdom of God on Earth.\nLife After Death\nWhere do we go when we die? Our spirit self makes a spiritual journey to the Spiritual World. It is the realm i~ which\nwould live with God receiving His love eternally. Our life on earth is a preparation for the eternal world of spmt. The\nquality of life in the spiritual eternal world depends on the moral/ethical quality of our life here on earth. Whether we go\nto Heaven or Hell depends on our personal response in lifestyle, to the Word of God as spoken in scriptures.\nA close study of Divine Principle is recommended for better understanding of these issues.\n_he Fall of Man\nt is the origin of evil What is sinl .What was the sin ?f the first human ancestors Why did they sin Who is SaranI\nere did Satan come from? Why did God not stop Sill from entering human society?\nThe sin of Adam and Eve and the Archangel Lucifer was misuse of love. They shared sexual love at a time period of\nimmaturity, when that relationship was strictly forbidden. Their love was unlawful, therefore immoral. Their sin was\nfornication. (Jude 6-7) As a result, they hid their private parts in shame (Gen. 3:7). Adam and Eve acquired evil nature.\nHuman history since that time is fraught with suffering. Adultery, promiscuity and prostitution, with its accompanying\ndisease and exploitation, has led to untold misery. Sodomy, rape, sexual harassment and abuse have been the shame of\nevery civilization.\nNeither the passing of laws, nor religious preaching has been able to stop this decadence. Satan is apparently in\ncomplete control. (In. 8:44) The Purpose of Life, which is the fulfillment of the Three Great Blessings, (Gen. 1:28) is\nfrustrated daily by Satan. It is a sad truth that many people willfully assist the frustration of God's Will every day.\nA serious study of Divine Principle is recommended to the reader to understand process of the Fall, the motivation of\nthe angel, how Satan continues to dominate human affairs and therefore how we can defeat him. Knowledge is power; the\nTruth will set us free.\n(e) Mission of the Messiah\nWhen did God decide to send a Messiah to the worldly What did God expect the Messiah to do? Did Jesus come to\ndie? Then why did He allude to the condemnation of the people of Israel for rejecting and crucifying Him? (Matt. 21:33-\n43) .\nIn this section of Divine Principle, Jesus reveals intimate details about the frustrations, betrayals and persecution He\nsuffered as Satan sought to obstruct Jesus' mission. Jesus made every effort to prepare the foundation for the Kingdom of\nHeaven on earth. The people, however, lacked faith. He therefore had to die. II becomes clear that the Crucifixion was a\nsecondary path that Jesus took due to faithlessness by the people. We still await the coming Kingdom. (Matt. 6:10; Heb\n8:10; Reverend 21:3-4).\nHISTORY OF GOD'S PROVIDENCE\nHuman history is a record of God's work to restore mankind and the creation~ to His sovereignty. Immediately after\nthe Fall of Man, God began His providence to prepare a foundation for the Messiah. The Torah, the Holy Bible and the\nHoly Qur\u2019an provide a graphic presentation of God's Providence.\nAt different times in human history, God, in His wisdom, has chosen to send messages to humankind through\nprophets. God's choice of. a prophet or propherEOss, according to scriptural history, was based on that chosen Central\nPerson's faith, moral authority and personal dlSposltoon. The prophets have as a result come from Virtually all the religlous\nknown. Noah Abraham, Moses Gautama Buddha, Confucius, Jesus, Mohammed, Martin Luther, Indira Gandhi, Dr Martin\nLuther King. to mention but a' few. The message of God through the prophets is always all-embracing, universal and\ndressed to all persons on earth. Centering on prophets, God in His wisdom, has inspired the growth of religions through\nwhich the faithful can worship and find spiritual support and nurture. On the basis of these religions, civilizations have\nbeen developed with God as a Prime Mover, preparing a foundation for the Messiah.\nTherefore, all major religions and their civilizations are God inspired. They all anticipate the final return of the\nmessenger of God to establish the reign of love, order, joy and happiness eternally. It is in this respect that all religions,\nincluding Christianity, should receive, accept and follow the Lord when He comes. (In. 3:16) The leaders of the world's\nreligions should know the Heart of God and work in love, unity and harmony with each other for the evolution of a moral\nworld where God's Will is done. (Matt. 6:10)\nReligious arrogance, intolerance, bigotry and prejudice are contrary to Go~:s Will. \"Love. God with all your heart, all your\nmind and all your soul. Then love your neighbor as you love yourself. This Word IS the measuring rod and God s\nstandard.\nJESUS\nJesus of Nazareth came as the Christ, the Second Adam, the only begotten Son of God. He became one with God,\nspeaking the words of God and doing the works of God and revealing God to the people. The people, however, rejected\nand crucified Him, thereby preventing the building of the Kingdom of God on earth at that time. Jesus, however, was\nvictorious over Satan in His crucifixion and resurrection and thus made possible spiritual salvation for those who are\nreborn through Him and the Holy Spirit as the spiritual True Parents and of humankind. The restoration of the Kingdom of\nGod on earth awaits the Second Coming of Christ.\nTHE UNIFICATION CHURCH\n. God's Will is the fulfillment of the 3 Great Blessings. (Gen. 1:28) That Will is absolute, eternal and unchanging (Is.\n46:11). God inspired Reverend Moon to establish a body through which His message and program of salvation could\nbe advanced due to skepticism by leaders of established churches. He founded the Holy Spirit Association for the\nUnification of World Christianity (HSA-I:JWC) ifl 1954. It is this organization that has in recent years become\", popularly known as the Unification Church.\nThe Unification Church is today represented in 160 nations. We hold Wednesday evening and Sunday worship\nservices and have a dedicated staff to teach the Divine Principle via lecture series and video presentations to newcomers\nevery day.\n1. To create God-centered individuals and families as a foundation for a moral and healthy society.\n2. To create one global human family transcending race, nationality, religion, culture and language barriers, centered\non God's Love.\n3. To create a God-centered society and world in which all forms of injustice are corrected. The basic unit necessary\nfor the progressive realization of these goals is the Ideal Family. It is in this light that we understand Genesis 1:28, Heb.\n8:10, and Rev. 21:3-4.\nTHE UNIFICATION MOVEMENT\nReverend Moon has endeavored to fulfill his mission by broadening the Scope of his ministry through an array of\norganizations and associations touching on religion, culture, the arts, academia, media, industry, technology - that is, the\nentire spectrum of human end,>avor. Supporters of these organizations include personalities who understand and support\nthe overall vision and objective of the Reverend Sun Myung Moon, but who may or may not be members of the\nUnification Church. It is these broad array of organizations, including the Church, which are generally referred to as the\nUnification Movement. A brief description of some of these organizations follows:\nINTER-RELIGIOUS FEDERATION FOR WORLD PEACE (IRFWP)\nThis federation brings together Ieaders and scholars of the world's religion in a united effort to bring tolerance,\nunderstanding, harmony and God's love among the peoples of the world. The Federation, in conjunction with the\nInternational Religious Foundation, hosts the Assembly of the World's Religions. Key supporters of this effort are H. G. Dr.\nPaulos Mar Gregarious, Metropolitan of Delhi, Syrian Orthodox Church and former President of World Council of\nChurches, Sheikh Ahmed Zabarah, Grand Mufti of Yemen and Sheikh Ahmed Kuftaro, Grand Mufti of Syria among others.\nFEDERATION FOR WORLD PEACE (FWPJ\nThis is an organization formed by Reverend Moon to bring together the world's leaders to share their wisdom and\nexperience to seek solutions to problems which affect relations between peoples and nations of the world. The\nFederation hosts the Summit Council for World Peace, an event that has in the past brought together Presidents, heads of\ngovernment, former presidents and other lead\u2019s. Key supporters of this effort include H. E. Kenneth Kaunda, iormer\nPresident of Zambia; Dr. Abdel Aziz Hegazy, former Prime Minister of Sudan; H. E. Canaan S. Banana, for president of\nZimbabwe; Sir Edward Heath, former British Prime Minister; H. E. Francisco Morales Bermudez, former President of\nRepublic of Peru; and H. E. Douglas MacArthur II, former Ambassador of the United States to Japan, among others.\nWOMEN'S FEDERATION FOR WORLD PEACE (WFWP)\nThe WFWP was founded by Mrs. Hak Ja Han Moon to facilitate the greater participation of women in public affairs.\nThe WFWP notes that human history to-date has largely been male dominated. Policies and Events have' largely used the\nlogic of power and politics alone. However, today's problems cannot be solved by this method alone'. A new logic oi\nreconciliation, compassion, love, service and sacrifice is required on the part of women and men working together as\ncomplementary partners. The place to begin is within the family. Stable, loving, moral and enduring families (Ideal\nFamilies) is a primary goal of WFWP world-wide.\nAmong notable supporters and participants in this effort are George & Barbara Bush, former President ,lnd First Lady\nof the United States of America; Ms. Maureen Reagan, daughter of Ronald Reagan, former President, U.S.A., and Mrs.\nSadat, former First Lady of Egypt.\nPROFESSORS WOLRD PEACE ACADEMY (PWPA)\nThe PWPA is an association of University Professors and lecturers dedicated 10 finding peaceful solutions to problems\nthat pose the threat of war or violence. PWPA promotes research on peace issues, convenes international congresses for\nthe discussion of the same and publishes findings by academics using a cross-disciplinary approach. Notable supporters\nand contributors in this effort include professors and lecturers from universities in every continent.\nWORLD MEDIA ASSOCIATION\nThis is a consortium of individuals and organizations concerned with advancing a high standard of journalistic Ethics,\nand furthering awareness of the responsibility of the media to fight vigorously for freedom of expression. The association\nsponsors fact-finding tours for media professionals and opinion leaders to areas of the world of especially crucial\nimportance. It also host the World Media Conference, which brings to ils deliberations a clear premise: to uphold the\nvalue of free and responsible media as being indispensable to democracy and the survival of free societies.\nCOLLEGIATE ASSOCIATION FOR THE RESEARCH OF PRINCIPLES (CARP)\nThis is an international, educational student movement dedicated to co-ordinate the contribution of youth and\nstudents in the quest for world peace. CARP believes that the key to solving conflicts is the healing power of God's love.\nOnly as individuals experience personal fulfillment and peace within, can they have the inner strength and courage to\nlove and serve humanity in the quest for global peace.\nINTERNATIONAL RELIEF FRIENDSHIP FOUNDATION (IRFF)\nThis is a non-profit humanitarian agency involved in providing emergency aid whenever and wherever possible. It coordinates\nsolicitation for material goods for charitable distribution to help others in a crisis. IRFF has been involved in\nemergency relief work among refugees, including Rwanda. IRFF also creates and sponsors short and long term\nprograms in agriculture and rural development, education and technical training, urban and community service and\nemergency disaster relief.\nThe Concept of True Parents\nThose who know the biography of Reverend and Mrs. Moon and the Unification Movement in heart recognize them\nas the True Parents of humankind. Their position has been won through blood, sweat and tears in a life of total dedication\nto God's Will and the fulfillment of the Messianic mission as commissioned by Jesus. The institution of True Parents as a\nvictorious foundation was established in 1960 at the Holy Blessing (Wedding) of Reverend Sun Myung Moon and Hak Ja\nHan.\nThey have successfully restored and resolved the sin of Adam & Eve who rejected God's Will, sinned and established\na fallen family centered on selfish love under Satan's blood lineage. The fruits of this union have been evident in virtually\nall families; selfishness, infidelity, dishonesty, exploitation, oppression, abuse, violence, et al.\nReverend & Mrs. Moon have in the course of their life established the first family that God recognizes as His own\nfamily by blood lineage, the True Family. They stand as model of The Ideal Family in which God's True Love is manifest.\nThe International Holy Weddings (Blessing)\nIn the position of True Parents, Reverend & Mrs. Moon invite those who recognize them to participate in the Blessing\nCeremonies which are the process by which the candidates are engrafted to the \"Tree of Life\" (True Parents) and become\npart of the growing family of God by blood lineage. This is the Way of Salvation (restoration of the original sinless state of\nthe individual and family).\nThose who participate do so in either of two categories:\na) Single (non-married) participants, and\nb) previously married couples.\nSingle Candidates\nSingle candidates could be from any of the following situations: Those who have never experienced sexual love;\nthose who have experienced sexual love but never married; those divorced; and those widowed.\nA candidate of this class sends a photograph in two copies for matching at the Unification Movement matching office.\nOnce matched by Reverend Moon, each candidate, through express mail, receives the photograph of their matching\npartner in good time, with all pertinent information such as contact address and personal details.\nIn previous years when smaller groups used to participate in these events, it was usual that The partners mel al the\nvenue of the Blessing celebration. However, the foundation of the Unification Movement has grown to such an extent\nthat this earlier arrangement has become logistically and financially difficult.\nIt is in this context that modern telecommunications technology has been utilized. The True Parents can now confer\nthe Blessing to participants in all nations of the world through the use of Satellite telecommunications. Technology is a\nprovidential tool that God has provided. The matched partners are responsible to initiate their eternal relationship 0 love\nand service to God, to each other and to humanity at their convenience.\nThe Blessing is Voluntary\nThe matching and subsequent Blessi~& ceremony are voluntary events. All candidates understand this: Ca,dldales for\nBlessing come from members of the Unification Church, from members of organisations Initiated and IIlspored by the\nReverend Sun Myung Moon and his wife (but who may not be members of the Church), from members of Christian\nchurches who want to join the task of establishing world peace through ideal families and leaders and members of other\nreligions. The overall purpose is to establish the substantial Kingdom of God through God-centered individuals, then\nfamilies across religious, cultural, racial, language and social class barriers. In the fullness of time, enduring world peace'\nwill become a reality for the nations and peoples of the earth.\nTo qualify, a candidate must demonstrate a firm commitment to the highest moral standards. Pre-marital and extramarital\nsex is forbidden. Candidates, through the power of Divine Principle, are able to abstain from promiscuous\nconduct. HIV carriers do not qualify. Early testing of applicants leads to early diagnosis of the problem. HIV carriers are\nidentified early and are therefore provided with counseling at an early stage. In this way, the Unification Movement is\nseriously solving the problem of the spread of AIDS.\nUnification Movement & Business Enterprise\nThe Unificatit'n Church is committed to the establishment of God's Kingdom on Earth. This involves the harnessing of\nnatural resources given as a gift to humankind by God. This entails the use of science, technology and the application of\nGodly principles in The conduct of business enterprise.\nGod has blessed the Unification Movement with phenomenal success in business. This has been Reverend and Mrs.\nMoons fulfillment of God's Third Blessing to Man to \"have dominion\" over the things of creation (Gen. 1:28).\nUnification holdings span the realms of telecommunications (Manhattan Centre, New York; Atlantic Studios,\nWashington DC), media Washinglon Times Corp, Washington DC: Nolieias del Mundo, New York; Insight weekly\nnewsmagazine; Middle East Times, Egypt; Seiyge Times, Seoul Korea; among others), fishing industry (International Ocean\nEnterprises), farming (New Hope Farm project, Brazil), ship and motor vehicle assembly (Master Marine, Inc; Seilo\nMachinery; Panda Motor Corporation, China), hotels, finance industry, food processing, pharmaceutical and others.\nThis success has come about only on the foundation of spiritual victory by the True Parents in God's work of\nrestoration and recreation of the world and its peoples.\nINVITATION\nIdeal Families for World Peace\nWe invite all conscientious citizens to I'oin us in our quest for lasting peace on earth. We invite leaders and followers\nof all churches and denominations and for lowers of all religions to study the Divine Principle, the clear, unambiguous\nmessage of God to Humanily today irrespective of religious or philosophical association.
