{"text": "Why health for all by the year 2000 is out of question\nBy KARIUKI WANGAI\nEver since the sixties, health for\nall by the year 2000 has been a\npopular slogan among politicians,\nUnited Nations agencies and\npharmaceutical concerns\nthroughout the world.\nBut with the magical date a\nshort five years away, this is\nturning to be a mere pipe dream.\nWhile the sixties and the seventies\nwere characterised by all out\nwars to eradicate killer diseases\nthat had ravaged mankind\nfor centuries, efforts appear to be\nslackening and despair to take\nroot as the 20th draws to a close.\nAs if taking cue, pathogens are\nstriking with a vengeance. Microbes\nthought to have been long\nconquered have made a comeback,\nothers have developed resistance\nthat mocks available\ndrugs while new ones defy all efforts\nto get a cure.\nThe past couple of years have\nseen serious re-emergencies of infectious\ndiseases once thought to\nhave been eradicated. These include\ncholera in Latin America,\nyellow fever in Kenya and diphtheria\nin Russia. Poliomyelitis\nhas also seen a re-emergence, the\nmost notable case being that of\nthe Netherlands where 68 cases\nwere reported in 1994.\nOf more concern are new\nstrains of pathogenes that no longer respond to available drugs. Disease like tuberculosis, pneumonia,\nmeningitis and gonorrhea\ncan no longer be treated effectively\nwith the wide array of\ndrugs that have been effective for\ndecades, and pharmaceutical experts\nare having to go back to the\ndrawing boards to develop new\nones.\nWriting in a recent issue of the\njournal of Global Child Health\nNews & Review, Dr Alexander\nTomasz, of the Rockfeller University\nin New York, attributes\nthe rise of drug-resistant mutant\npathogenes to \"excessive and inappropriate\nuse of so-called miracle\nantibiotic drugs\" and casts\ndoubts as to whether the pharmaceutical\nindustry will be able\nto develop new antibiotics suitable\nfor treating multi-resistant\ngerms.\nAmong the new diseases that\nhave sent shockwaves through\nthe medical profession is Aids.\nMore than ten years into the\npandemic, a cure is yet to be\nfound, and the implications of\nHIV on the proliferation of opportunistic\ninfections threatens\nto reverse whatever progress has\nbeen made towards global health\nby the end of the century.\nThe Ebola scare early this year\nin Zaire serves to remind mankind\nof what might lie in store\nand the need for concerted effort.\nWithout international cooperation the Ebola virus would have caused havoc only comparable to\nthe 1918-1919 influenza pandemic\nin Europe.\nA number of factors have compromised\nthe realisation of global\nhealth by century's turn, chief\namong these being growing economic\nhardships. The alarming\nrise in poverty levels in many\nparts of the world has meant a\ndeterioration in health-support\nservices.\nIn many developing countries\nthey have literally broken down,\naccessibility to safe water is limited\nand hygiene is at its worst -\nthe perfect recipe for ill health.\nThe situation is aggravated by\nenvironmental degradation as the\npoor try to eke a living. In some\nplaces the earth is supporting\npopulations too big for it, with\nthe result that the environment is\nadversely affected. The fact that\nthese consequencies may not be\nwell understood only goes to\nmake a bad situation worse.\nTragically, the poverty is in\nmost cases self-inflicted rather\nthan the result of global economic\ntrends. Poor countries lead the\nway in corruption and misappropriation\nof public resources and\nthe governments in charge appear\nto have no concern for the\ncitizenry.\nRather than look unto themselves\nfor solutions, these governments are content to extend a\nbegging arm and blame donors\nfor their plight.\nEfforts by United Nations\nagencies, mainly the World\nHealth Organisation and Unicef,\nto improve global health are being\nhampered by shortage of finance\nas donor nations default on\ntheir quotas.\nEarly this year WHO announced\nthat it was trimming its\nthird world programmes by a\nthird. UNICEF is also in the\nsame situation, which spells\ndoom to millions of children and\nadults in the developing world.\nEven with a global. recession, reduced support for UN-backed\nhealth programmes portrays lopsided\nprioritising on the part of\ndonor countries.\nAccording to a Unicef report\nreleased recently, only one-fiftieth\nof the world's spending on\nmilitary activities would be\nenough to ensure good health for\nall.\nOn the other hand, the UN is\ndiverting resources to peacekeeping\noperations with inevitable\ncutbacks in sectors like\nhealth.\nMuch has to be done if \"health\nfor all\" is to be realised. But that\nwont be by the year 2000.\n\nA. Polio victim: Diseases like polio, once thought to have been eliminated, have re-emerged and seem to defy modern drugs. This makes health for all unrealisable in the next five years"}
