{"text": "The silent heroes of medicine\nBy LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN\nin San Francisco\nWhy do researchers and willing patients test the boundaries of medical science when they are told by friendly, and sometimes hostile, critics that the risks are so daunting that the experiments are doomed to fail?\nPart of the answer may be that as the 15th anniversary of the discovery of Aids nears, many doctors are as frustrated as patients by the lack of more effective treatments for the disease, and are, therefore, joining their patients in pushing the limits of treatment.\nThe best example of such a collaboration is the recent experimental transplant of baboon bone marrow into Mr Jeff Getty, a 38-year old Aids activist who will probably die of Aids, but whose life may be prolonged if the experiment succeeds.\nMr Getty worked as a partner with a team of researchers at the University of California at San Francisco and the University of Pittsburg, who designed and conducted the experiment.\nIt is hard to imagine anyone who was better informed of the risks of an experiment that he chose to enter than Mr Getty. He has no formal training in science, but he has learned more immunology than many doctors in his efforts to overcome 15 years of infection with HIV, the Aids virus.\nMr Getty has exhausted all standard and other experimental alternatives for Aids. And he has battled with scientists and government bureaucracies to speed up development and testing of novel Aids therapies.\nFor more than two years, he campaigned for the experimental baboon bone marrow transplant that, after many delays, he received here last week.\nIt is an experiment that Dr Hugh Auchincloss of the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, reflecting the views of other experts, has said \"will probably hasten his death, not prevent it\".\nBut the decision was Mr Getty's Dr Auchincloss said. Mr Getty; who is in isolation in a room at San\nFrancisco General Hospital, knows the prevailing medical opinion. But he also knows that medical history is full of examples of surprises made' by doctors and patients who defied the word of leading experts.\nFor years, he studied immunology textbooks and journals. He attended scientific meetings. And his group of Aids activists organized weekly tutorials where he listened to invited scientists.\n\"We just boned up and learned the stuff,\" Mr Getty said.\nDr Suzanne T. IIdstad, a transplant surgeon and immunologist at the University of Pittsburgh, who is a chief investigator of the baboon bone marrow experiment, said in an interview: \"Sometimes he asks me better scientific questions than my colleagues.\nAfter Mr Getty learned that Dr lIdstad was planning to use a novel technique that she had developed in\nPittsburgh to do a baboon bone marrow transplant, he was the first to volunteer. Then he participated in discussions of the proposal at many scientific meetings without letting on that he was a candidate.\n\"Just the whole concept of fighting keeps Jeff going,\" said Dr Steven Deeks, another principal investigator.\n\"When he is fighting, it energises him probably better than any medication.\"\nToday's standard practice was yesterday's experimental therapy, and the advances are often made possible by courageous patients, who open the door a crack to better the lives of those who follow. Such patients are the silent heroes of medicine.\nFrom the New York Times\nService"}
