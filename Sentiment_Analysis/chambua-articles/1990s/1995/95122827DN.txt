{"text": "December 8, 1995\n\nScientists \u2028\nrevisit \u2028\ntheories \u2028\non causes \u2028\nof Aids \u2028\nCATHERINE MGENDI \u2028\nHow the Human Immuno-deficiency Virus (HIV) destroys the \u2028\nimmunity system and \u2028\ncauses Aids remains one Of the \u2028\nbiomedical mysteries of \u2028this day and age. \u2028\nMany possible explanations \u2028\nhave been put forth, with most \u2028\nbeing rejected outright. The few \u2028\nthat have held any water are \u2028\non numerous assumptions. \u2028\nThe longest standing explanation \u2028\nbrainstorming workshop convened to \u2028\nreview what is known about the \u2028\ndisease. \u2028\nA recent issue or Science mazine describes the popularly \u2028\naccepted cytopathic model of \u2028\nthe HIV pathogenesis as 'too \u2028\nsimplistic.'! \u2028 magazine says the widely accepted model is based on \u2028\ntoo many assumptions, number of which have raised numerous doubts among the scientific fraternity. \u2028\nFighting \u2028\nThe cytopathic model attributes to the virus' direct destruction of the key white bloodcells \u2014 the T lymphocytes onto \u2028\nwhich CD4+ receptor cells am attached. The CD4+ cells are responsible for fight foreign \u2028\nwithin the \u2028\nThis explanation has survived \u2028\nmany criticisms because it provides an explanation for the decrease in the of CD4+ receptor cells in HIV positive \u2028\nFurther the popular cytopathic model shown that \u2028\nadministration of antihiv \u2028\ndrugs, the CD4+ cell count increased markedly. \u2028\nNew findings associated with \u2028\nthe Hiv/Aids have however raised \u2028\ndoubts about the strength of this \u2028\nmodel, says Science. \u2028\nOne such finding is \u2028\na very small proportion Of the \u2028\nCD4+ cells have been found to \u2028\nbe actually infested by the \u2028\nvirus. \u2028\nAnother is the fact that the \u2028\nbolt. has a natural capability \u2028\nto produce the CD4+ cells \u2028\nmuch faster than an infected \u2028\nwhite blood cell could produce \u2028\nnew infectious viruses. \u2028\nDeath \u2028\nThe meeting, after serious \u2028\ndeliberations, came up with \u2028\nsome new theories as to how \u2028\nthe HIV virus could be causing \u2028\nAids, says the Science magazine. \u2028\nOne theory advanced is that \u2028\nthe virus' surface protein \u2028\n120 \u2014 caused activation \u2028\nof the immune responses, resulting in the production of an \u2028\nexcessive number of the CD4+ \u2028\ncells. Because the body's natural reaction would be to rid itself of the excess \nin a \u2028\nfalse counting system. \u2028\nAnother interesting hypothesis put forth to lain the \u2028\ndeath process of the CD4+ cells \u2028\nthat the cells became suicidal when they came upon \u2028\nforeign bodies the blood \u2028\n\"kiss of death\" or apoptosis was yet another explanation whereby the CD4+ cells \u2028\nwere said to undergo a pm. \u2028\ndeath to clear the \u2028\nof "}
