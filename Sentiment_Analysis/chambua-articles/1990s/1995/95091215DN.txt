{"text": "Sep 12, 96\n\nSexual Relations start early Saitoti\n\nBy TOM CHITECHI\nMost Kenyan youths get involved\nin sexual relationships by the age\nof 16, Vice-President George\nSaitoti said yesterday.\nStudies, Prof Saitoti said, had\nrevealed that the young people\ninvolved in early sexual relationships\nhad many partners.\n\"Currently, the youth form 60\nper cent of\u00b7 Kenya's population.\nTherefore, the socio-economic\nimplications of the HIV /Aids disease\ngiven the current population\nstructure are potentially vast.\"\nThe loss of young adults would\n,A.have an adverse impact on the\n\"national economy.\nProf Saitoti's remarks were in\na speech read by Permanent\nSecretrary Pharis Kuindwa at\nthe official opening of the International\nStudents Conference on\nAids at Kenyatta International\nConference Centre,\nNairobi.\nGiven the negative impact of\nAids on the economy, he said,\nyoung people had a social obligation\nto the rest of the population\nto \"be honest and responsible to\nresist peer pressure.\"\nThe Vice-President said sexual\nissues were sensitive because they\ntouched on deep-rooted traditions\nand beliefs. Some people,\ndue to their beliefs and traditions,\nwould rather assume that\nreproductive health problems\nthat affect the young did not\nexist.\n\"But times have changed now,\nespecially with the influence of\nthe mass media, and failure of\n_the youth to have access to well\ninformed information sources\nmakes them susceptible to misleading\ninformation often distorted\nto meet commercial objectives,\"\nProf Saitoti said.\nThe Government considered\nAids not only as a health issue,\nbut as a development problem.\n\"The success of Government\nefforts will depend on how individuals\nmake smart decisions and\nchange behaviour,\" he said.\nAssistant Minister Gideon\nMutiso, who represented the\nMinister for Health, Mr Joshua\nAngatia, said Africa had the\nhighest concentration of people\ninfected with Aids.\nWorld Health Organisation\nstatistics indicated that 8.5 million\nyoung adults infected with\nAids live in Sub-Saharan Africa.\nThis, Mr Angatia said, called\nfor the challenging of cultural resistance\nto discussing sexual issues\nwith children \"in a world\nwhere traditional norms and values\nare constantly breaking down\nbecause of Western influence.\n\"Our greatest weapon against\nAids in Africa lies in active\nmobilisation of our communities\nto effect the desired response\nagainst Aids.\"\nThe Nairobi University Vice-\nChancellor, Prof Francis\nGichaga, said the university had\nlost a number of students and\nstaff to Aids.\nHe called for sensitisation of\nstudents on danger!! of Aids and\nhow to curb the spread of the\nkiller disease among them and\nelsewhere in the community.\nThe one-week conference\norganised by the University of\nNairobi Students Aids Control\n.Association is being attended\nparticipants from Kenya,\nUganda, Tanzania and South\nAfrica."}
