{"text": "Accidents hit dental health\nBy NATION Correspondent\nRoad accidents are a major cause of dental problems in Sub-Saharan Africa, a visiting dentist said yesterday.\nProf Martin Hobdell, dean and director of the Faculty of Dentistry at the University of Western Cape, South African, said road accidents resulted in broken or lost teeth or fractured jaws.\n\"The increase in accident-related dental problems is straining the facilities used for dealing with dental operations.\" Prof Hobdell, who once served as a maxillofacial surgeon (one who performs surgical operations on the face or sets dislocated jaws) in a Maputo hospital, said:\n\"I perform three minor operations on fracture' victims every week, plus a major operation for more serious accident victims.\"\nHe is the World Health Organisation's Sub-Saharan regional dental representative and is visiting Kenya to initiate a network for oral health.\nProf Hobdell said a major public campaign to educate motorists and pedestrians on basic safety measures, such as wearing seat belts, could improve the situation.\nHe identified Aids as increasingly affecting oral health. \"Six per cent of the HIV -positive persons are diagnosed through oral screening.\"\nSmoking tobacco coupled with drinking alcoholic beverages, said the dental surgeon, \"worsens the oral health of an individual."}
