{"text": "My best example of sloppy questioning is presenter Kasuja nyonyi who briefly replaced Nashon 'Nash' Atsiaya on FacetoFace. Kasuja handled Florence Mukhoni, the director of an Aids lobby group rather lamely. Maybe because we are not sure of the difference between facetoface and preference.\nThere was the issue about media coverage of Aids victims which Florence kept lamenting about. We all dread the possibility and are scared as we grop with the reality of the Aids scourge.\nBut why, Kasuja, did you not ask Florence whether there is a law barring reporting on HIV-positive people?\nAnd why did her organization choose to parade them in public for the media to report them? Is the priority of Aids NGOs to campaign against Aids or become forums suing (for money) media reporting on Aids cases?"}
