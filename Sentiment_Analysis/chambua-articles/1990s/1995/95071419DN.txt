{"text": "Vatican's views on women's role\nBy PATRALEKHA CHATTERJEE\nin ROME\nKarol Wotjyla, otherwise known\n- as Pope John Paul II and the\nVicar of Christ, started the year\nthinking about women.\nOn January 1, the World Day\nof Peace, the 75-year\u00b7.old spiritual\nleader of the world's 950 million\nCatholics reflected in a public ad\u00b7\ndress at the Vatican on the role\nwomen are called to playas\n\"teachers of peace.\"\nThe first Sunday of the following\nmonth, he announced he\nwould begin a series of weekly\npublic addresses on female figures\nwho have distinguished\nthemselves in the church history\nby promoting peace.\nAnd his latest and longest encyclical,\nthe 104-page Gospel of\nLife published in April, is a clarion\ncall for a \"new feminism,\" free\nof \"individualism, favouring the\nculture of life.\" The Virgin Mary\nis the role model.\n\"Women,\" according to the\nPope, \"have a full right to become\nactively involved in all\nareas of public life, and this right\nmust be affirmed and guaranteed,\nwhere necessary, through appropriate legislation.\"\nBut the public role of women\nshould not \"detract from their\nunique role within the family,\"\nThe Pope's agenda includes a demand\nfor more \"decisive steps\"\nin order to \"recognise and promote\nthis very important reality\"\nOne reason for so firmly outlining\nthe papal vision of women is\nthe Holy See's keenness to influence\npublic debate in the run-up\nto the Fourth World Conference on Women in September.\nMore than 30,000 women from\naround the globe and 185 world\nleaders are expected at the United\nNations' meeting in Beijing.\nBut since the UN population\nconference in Cairo last year,\nwhen pro-choice groups\nbrickbatted the Holy See for its\nanti-abortion alliance with Islamic\northodoxies, the Vatican has\nlearned to wage its propaganda\nwar with greater finesse.\nTo start, it has employed a legion\nof savvy female personnel.\nVatican delegations to regional\nconferences in preparation for\nBeijing have been carefully\nstacked with women.\nAt the European meeting in\nVienna, late last year, four of the\nfive delegates were women. Asked\nhow he felt being the only man in\nthe team, delegation leader Bishop\nPaul Josef Cordes quipped,\n\"It's easier being with women.\"\nOne woman who will probably\nbe part of the Vatican's armoury\nin Beijing is Lucianne Salle. With\nher smart red jacket, elegant\ncoiffure, collection of conference\nbadges from exotic locales and\nconstantly ringing phone, Salle\ncould easily be mistaken for a\nsummit-hopping UN official.\nSalle was a psychologist and a\nCatholic activist in Paris before\nshe gave up her job and moved to\nRome. Working for Pope John\nPaul II, she says, has been good\nfor her career.\n\"I get the same salary as a man\ndoing the same work, ' Salle insists.\nAnd the perks of the job as\na high-powered bureaucrat in the\nPontifical Council for the Laity include a large, well-furnished office,\ntravel around the world, and\ntrips to UN conference to spread\nthe papal word.\nHer work has also meant slogging\nit out verbally with feminists\nwho don't see eye to eye with her\nboss on abortion and a myriad of\nother issues. Salle clearly enjoys\nthe jousts.\nAsk her how she feels about the\nCatholic Church's refusal to allow\nthe ordination of women, Salle\npromptly says she would personally\nnever fight to have a priest's\njob.\n\"It depends on what your goals\nare. Do you want to be known, to\ncreate an impact? If you do, a job\nas a priest is not the only way.\n\"Look at Mother Teresa. Six\nor seven years back, I was in an\nAfrican village when she suffered\na heart attack. Everyone was crying.\nNo one would react the same\nway for an ordinary priest ...\"\nThe Pope's representatives\nhave also clearly realised the importance\non fighting on different\nfronts, particularly on the abortion\nissue. After Cairo, it has remained\na simmering debate in\nthe months before Beijing.\nThe Vatican seems to be allowing\nCatholic NGOs, who wield\nenormous clout in many developing\ncountries, to do most of the\npublic fighting against what the\npope calls the encroaching \"culture\nof death.\"\nIn the run-up to the Beijing\nmeeting, over 50 Catholic NGOs\nwere to meet in the Vatican for\nthe voluntary organisations to\ndraw up' a common strategy for\nthe Beijing conference . \"More co-operation with Islamic\nnations\" is also part of the\nVatican's agenda, says Monsignor Peter Elliot of the Pontifical\nCouncil for the Family. \"At Cairo, we read the conspiracy theories\nin the press.\n\"But speaking to Islamic diplomats,\nI found their reactions were\nlike any concerned father or family\nperson. They do not want intrusions\nof decadent Western values\nand they respect Pope John\nPaul's teachings. We can make\ncommon cause.\"\nThe Holy See continues to be.\nquietly dogmatic on a range of\nother issues that will be prominent at the conference on women.\nSample: The answer to the Aids,\n'crises, Vatican representatives\nmaintain, is not safe sex but fidelity and monogamy.\nBut what should a couple do if\none of the partners already has\nHIV? Is the use of contraceptives\njustified? The answer is still a\nvigorous \"no\". The Vatican's emissaries say abstention would be\nthe only expression of true love in\nsuch situations .\nElliot rails against family planning\norganisatlons like the International\nPlanned Parenthood\nFoundation (IPPF) and speaks\nregularly of contraceptive imperialism\nand the 'racist agendas'\nof western NGO out to\nthwart. the growth of developing ,\ncounties \nBut it is not only hardline feminists\nand those distributing contraceptives\nwho beg to differ from the Pope .on certain matters.\nIn France, Monsignor Robert Cofty, who resigned his position as the Archbishop of Marseilles a\nmonth ago, backed the use of\ncondoms if it stopped a person\ninfected with the Aids virus from\n\"killing his neighbour.\"\nIn Britain, a group of Catholic\nnuns have set up the Catholic\nWomen's Ordination Group to\ncampaign for women as priests.\nAnd ordinary Catholics around\nthe world increasingly resort to\nabortion and rely on contraceptives for\nbirth control and protection\nagainst STDs.\nWhatever the Vatican says in\nBeijing, it cannot claim to be\nspeaking as the voice, of a unified\ncommunity. \n- Women a Future Service \nPope John Paul n gives \"Communion to a nun during a mass at Olomouc airport in the Czeeh Republic during his recent tour of the country.
