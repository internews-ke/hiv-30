Oliech, recently\ngave chilling  on the\nincrease number of: victims\n, in the country - he reminded\nKenyans to preventive\nmeasures bee se the increasing\nstories about \"new\"\nanti-aids drugs does not mean\n\u00b7the lethal disease a cure.\nIndeed, despite increasing local\nand international that\ncompanies are' developing new\npromising drugs against t acquired\nimmune deficiency. syndrome\n(AIDS), the biomedic 'scientists\nare reaching a dead in their\nstruggle to find a cure for the lethal\ninfection which undoubtedly\ngoing to kill mill ns within\nthe decade..\nThree years ago, he world\nseemed to ,be nearing breakthrough\nwith numerous laboratories\nin\u00b7 the develop nations\nrushing to tell the w rid that a\nnumber of compound' including\ngenetically engineered products\nwere ready to be launched against\nAids virus.\nHowever, the only anti-Aids\ndrug that is commercially available\nis AZT, the one which was\noriginally developed in the early\n60's to be used against cancer\nbut was \"discarded\",' r being\nfound to be ineffective C However,\nAZT was found to cur the replication\nof the Aids vi in test\ntubes.\nIt was quickly dev\nuse in management d\ninfection but the side \u00a2\nto discourage most c!-'\n.patients from using it< ile some\nresearchers say that so strains\nof the human immune deficiency\nvirus (HIV) which causes Aids\nare already resistant to the drug,\nStilI, the price of the drug is.\nbe undeserved monopoly and desire\nfor excessive pro s\n\nPromising\nDuring the 1989 in national\nProgramme on Aids Montreal,\nCanada. There w such interest\non the numerous compounds\nbeing developed for use\nagainst Aids. Nearly 70 alleged\nanti-Aids compounds nd vaccines\nare being developed by at\nleast 40 firms.\nHowever, none of the\nbe very promising and\njust replications of others and\ntheir anti-aids action is based on\nsimilar mechanisms. Drugs related\nto AZT which have been tested\nand are awaiting c\ncommercialisation are\ndideoxyinosine (DDI) by Bristol .\nMyers and dideoxycytidine\n(DDC) by Hoffman La Roche.\nBoth drugs remain toxic and\nthey inhibit enzymes that HIV\nrequires for growth. There are\nother compounds that are aimed\nat inhibiting specific enzymes\nlike the reverse transcriptase,\nspecific for retroviruses like HIV.\nThere are also those aimed at\nblocking action of other enzymes\nknown as proteases.\nEnthusiasm\nDuring the Canada Aids conference\nthere was much excitement\nabout genetically engineered\nproduct code named CD4\nwhich were supposed to block the\nsite which HIV uses to enter into\nbody cells. Even discoverers of\nthe virus like America's R. Gallo\ncould not hide enthusiasm for the\nCD4.\nBut, the virus seems to have\nout maneuver these experts and\nfew people talk about CD4. The\nlatest addition to these.' -\npounds are the interferons\nhave gained much prominence after\nKenyan researchers attained\nsome positive results using low\ndoses of natural interferon alpha\ngiven sublinguaIly.\n.. Kenyans have 'been associated\nwith two interferons, one,\nKemron dE!veloped by local researchers\nand now there is a new\none called Immunex from\nAustralia.\nApart from these, there is increased\ninterest in herbal medicine with\nexperts screening an increasing\nnumber of plants used in\ntraditional medicines among\npeople in developing nations.\nHowever, another major trend in\nthe war against the disease is the\ndevelopment of drugs or treatment regimens that can combat\nopportunistic infections.\n.. Thus, drugs aimed at managing\nDiorhoeah, tuberculosis, fungal\ninfections, skin problems and\ncancers that afflict those depressed\nimmune systems Being\ndeveloped to help .th ' e\nlonger and improve the quality Of\nwhile \"awaiting\" or\nhoping for the final cure that may\nfrom research laboratories.\nA good example of this is the\nthe anti-fungal drug called\nSporanox which was launched in\nMombasa this week by a Belgium\nFirm Janssen.
