{"text": "Kemron 'not ready for use\nBy PAUL REDFERN NATION\nSTAFF Correspondent, London\nThe director of the World Health\nOrganisation's Global programme\non Aids (GPA) says that more\narch needs to be done on Kenya's drug Kemron.\nIn an interview in the latest\nedition of The Courier a magazine\non issues affecting the European\nCommunity and the ACP\ncountries in the Rome Convention\nDr Michael Merson said:\n\"We don't know the effectiveness\nof Kemron.\"\n\"This drug is not yet ready for\nuse,\" he said. \"It needs to go\nthrough additional clinical testing using control trials.\n\"The studies done in Kenya\nwere not controlled. So I think we\ncannot say whether it is effective\nor not. It must be evaluated but\nin a careful controlled way,\" he\nsaid.\nThe Courier devotes 33 pages\nof its magazine to an analysis of\nAids saying there are now an estimated\neight million HIV carriers\nworld-wide and 283,010 reported\nAids cases in September 1990.\nDr Patrick Dixon the director\nof the international NGO Aids\nCare Education and Training\nunit questions why more overseas\naid has not been sent to developing\ncountries to combat the spread of the disease.\n\"The total contribution to the\nglobal Aids problems by the\nindustrialised nations is still\nquite small,\" Dixon says. For example\nthe total GPA budget for\nAids was less than half of what\nthe UK alone spends on Aids care\nfor less than 4,000 cases he says.\nDixon believes the reason is\npartly that in the West Aids is\nregarded as a disease that only\naffects gay men and drug users.\nHe points out that none of\nBritain's development agencies\nhas launched an appeal for Aids\nvictims world-wide believing that\na public appeal would not\nsucceed. Dixon notes that for developing\ncountries publicity for Aids\nmay bring some short-term funding\nbut could affect foreign investment\nand tourism in the\nfuture.\n\"Those who are well informed\nabout Aids in Africa can feel\npowerfuless to do anything significant,\" he says.\nConfronted by one in three infection\nrates already in some major\ncities, and the difficulty of\nchanging the sexual habits of a\nwhole generation it is easier perhaps\nto continue instead to drill\nwells Dixon says.\nAccording to the WHO there are five million HIV positive. African people, mainly in the 15-\n44 age bracket and often the most\neducated and most economically\nactive members of the\npopulation.\nThe death rates in this age\ngroup is 5 per 1,000 in sub-Saharan\nAfrica compared to 0.7 per\n1,000 in the developed countries.\nSome health experts fear that\ninfection rates will continue to\nincrease rapidly reaching a ceiling\nof 23 per cent of the population\nafter 25 years.\nDixon says the West must face\nup the fact that Aids is now primarily\ncaused by heterosexual\ncontact and that it should put\nmore resources into education."}
