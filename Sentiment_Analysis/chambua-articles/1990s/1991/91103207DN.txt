{"text": "TUESDAY OCTOBER 22 1991\n\nDiscard these outdated traditions\t\nI took a voluntary job with 'a non-governmental\norganization working amongst my Luo people. The job involves\ncreating public awareness as a'\nmeans of reducing the spread of the\ndeadly disease ~ids.\nMy job has been hampered by one major \nminds of rural folk. It is difficult to convince\n\nthing with different names.\nChira, as it is known among the people, is a \nproblem that I find very deeply-rooted in the\nthe people that Chira and Aids is the same \n\ndisease caused by transgressing certain cultural, beliefs within the community. The virus\nthat causes this disease, according to them,\nhas yet to, be discovered by scientists.\nThis belief is supported m a book by the .\nlate Paul Mboya, Richo Kelo Chira (Chira is\nCaused by Sin). '\nThe people hold strongly to their culture\nand their rate of adoption of new ideas is not in keeping with present-day Kenya.\nSo I find it quite naive for a people to hold\non to such outdated traditions that have no\nplace in today's modern society for the sake of\nculture.\nAids is a worldwide problem and the campaign\nto create awareness about it is a serious\nand intensive one.\nIt must be accepted by all people that the\nHIV virus exists.\nThe legend that Chira has been with us\nfrom time immemorial is, to say the least, a\nmyth that must be discarded in the present\nage. ,\nIt is believed by the Luo community that\nChira, which, to them, is a mysterious disease,\nis caused by among other things:\nSpending a night in the house of your son's\ndaughters' house, however big the house may\nbe.\nPlanting seeds when your wife is away. '\nStaying with your elder wife in a house or home that was once occupied by the young\nwife.\nFailing to fulfil what tradition requires after\nthe death of any of the parents or members of\nthe family.\nBuilding a house or home on the wrong side\nof one's land even though there may be no\nsolace available on the right side.\nFencing a home when the wife is away.\nEating certain organs of animals.\nThe list is long~ and varies from district to\ndistrict and to Violate any of these things is\ntaboo.\nThis causes much confusion when one marries\nfrom a different district, and, worse still,\nfrom a different tribe. ' '\nThese traditions should be 'changed to conform\nwith present-day developments.\nAlthough these traditions are dying, the\nrate of change is much slower than expected.\n, Sammie Hillary Ngwalla,\nKisumu."}
