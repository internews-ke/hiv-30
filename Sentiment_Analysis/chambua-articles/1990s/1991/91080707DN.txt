{"text": "Measure would be inappropriate\nDr Gatere's suggestion that HIV carriers be isolated is most unfortunate. It is\nis idle as treating advanced leprosy by\napplying ointment on the surface of rotting skin.\nIf his suggestion should be implemented,\n'we would have to reconsider the measure because many people in key positions will have\nbeen isolated including doctors and nurses\nmeant to manage Aids.\nThe nation is caught in an intricate web of\nviral conspiracy which cannot be curbed nor\nImproved by superficial measures like quarantine.\nAids is a complicated issue that can\nbest be tackled by effective manipulation of\npeople's attitude towards sex through appreciate\nand aggressive education and campaign. '\nMost of us have misguided notion that\nHIV carriers are sickly worn out people with\ndangling protruding bones and cloudy dying\neyes in sunken sockets. No. This condition is\nmerely a latter sign. of infectious HIV seeds\nthat might have been planted way back in\ntime, sometimes even 10 years before.\nThe HIV virus can lie low in the blood for\nover seven years before the carrier begins to\nshow signs of infection. During this period,\nthe carrier is as fit as a blood-swollen tick.\nSuch a person is called a seropositive because he tests positive but does not suffer from the\nhavoc of the HIV virus.\nThere is nothing to celebrate about being a\nseropositive because it is only a matter of time\nbefore the victim's system begins to give way\nto the varied effects of the virus. The difference\nbetween life and slow death is a question\nof the gestation period of the virus.\nThe gestation period is mainly decided by .\nthe virus' retroviral tricks:' It is called a\nretrovirus because it transcribes. its genetic\ncode into the nucleus of a previously healthy\ncell in the blood, transforming it into a virus producing factory.\nThe virus may render the nervous system\nsusceptible to infection by other opportunistic\ncousins which eat the victim's nervous\nsystem until the victim is overcome in one\nway or another.\nIn 1980,Aids was hardly known even in the\nUSA. By 1985, there were over 15,000 cases\nin the USA alone. Many cases in many countries pass and will continue to pass unnoticed.\nThe situation will certainly worsen\nmainly because of lack of cure, ignorance and\nnegative attitude toward sex.\nWith the old and the young using sex like\nsome occupational recreation; with male\nprostitutes buying sex like market-stall commodity;\nwith. female prostitutes peddling sex,\nhawkers; with innocent children inheriting a stigmatised legacy of viruses from dying parents; with the young and the old in urban\ncentres increasingly getting addicted to the\nlethal consolation of intravenous drugs; with\nall the known and the dubious possibilities of\ncontracting Aids, we can only hope that we\nwill not have to isolate half of the country's\npopulation by the year 2000.\n. Latent in Dr Gatere's suggestion is a traditional\nnotion that Aids carriers are immoral.\nIt is true sexual immorality and promiscuity\nis greatly responsible for the spread of the\nlegion of HIV virus. But one thing we should\nremember is that it is hard to draw any credible\nmoral distinction between that freelance\nwho finally catches the HIV worm and that\nself-censored condom-insured person scared\nof the HIV dread.\nI take Dr Gatere's opinion to be a typical\nstatement prompted by panic. The panic is\nJustified but the suggestion is inappropriate.\nIf Aids was a psychiatric phenomenon and\ncarriers were visibly mad men, then the isolation\nmeasure could be a worthwhile measure.\nAids, this furtively sinister viral conspiracy\ncreeping below our lives, is most scaring because it affects very delicate and sensitive\nareas of our .lives - sex and the family.\nOkelo P.
