{"text": "JUNE 16 1991\n\nAids continues to baffle researchers\n\nBy OTULA OWUO , Science Editor\n\nWhen, the director' medical services, Professor J. Oliech, recently\ngave chilling figures on the\nincrease number of victims, in the country \u2013 17 the reminded\nKenyans to stick to preventive\nmeasures bee se the increasing\nstories about \"new\"\nanti-aids drugs does not mean the lethal disease a cure.\nIndeed, despite increasing local\nand international ,claims that\ncompanies are' developing new\npromising drugs against acquired\nimmune deficiency. syndrome\n(AIDS), the biomedical 'scientists\nare reaching a dead in their\nstruggle to find a cure for the lethal\ninfection which undoubtedly\ngoing to kill mill ns within\nthe decade..\nThree years ago, the world\nseemed to ,be nearing g breakthrough\nwith numerous laboratories\nin\u00b7 the develop nations\nrushing to tell the w rid that a\nnumber of compound' including\ngenetically engineered products\nwere ready to be launched against\nAids virus.\n\n\nImmune\nHowever, the only anti-Aids\ndrug that is commercially available\nis AZT, the one which was\noriginally developed in the early\n60's to be used against ancer\nbut was \"discarded\",' r being\nfound to be ineffective C However,\nAZT was found to cur the replication\nof the Aids vi in test\ntubes.\nIt was quickly developed for\nuse in management of\ninfection but the side effects were\nto discourage most patients from using it while some\nresearchers say that so strains\nof the human immune deficiency\nvirus (HIV) which causes Aids\nare already resistant to the drug.\nNearly 70 alleged anti-Aids compounds and vaccines\nare being developed by at least 40 firms.\nHowever, none of the\nbe very promising and\njust replications of their anti-aids action is based on\nsimilar mechanisms. Drugs related\nto AZT which have been tested\nand are awaiting commercialization. \nMyers and dideoxycytidine\n(DDC) by Hoffman La Roche.\nBoth drugs remain toxic and\nthey inhibit enzymes that HIV\nrequires for growth. There are\nother compounds that are aimed\nat inhibiting specific enzvmes\nlike the reverse transcriptase,\nspecific for retroviruses like HIV.\nThere are also those aimed at\nblocking action of other enzymes\nknown as proteases.\nEnthusiasm\nDuring the Canada Aids conference\nthere was much excitement\nabout genetically engineered\nproduct code named CD4\nwhich were supposed to block the\nsite which HIV uses to enter into\nbody cells. Even discoverers of\nthe virus like America's R. Gallo\ncould not hide enthusiasm for the\nCD4.\nBut, the virus seems to have\nout manourved these experts and\nfew people talk about CD4. The\nlatest addition to these.' -\npounds are the interferon\u2019s\nhave gained much prominence after\nKenyan researchers attained\nsome positive results using low\ndoses of natural interferon alpha\ngiven sublingually.\n.. Kenyans have 'been associated\nwith two interferon, one,\nKemron developed by local researchers\nand now there is a new\none called Immunex from\nAustralia.\nApart from these, there is increased\ninterest in herbal medicine myth\nexperts screening an increasing\nnumber of plants used in\ntraditional medicines among\npeople in developing nations.\nHowever, another major trend in\nthe war against the disease is the\ndevelopment of drugs or treatment regimens that can combat\nopportunistic infections. Thus, drugs aimed at managing\nOlarrhoeah, tuberculosis, fungal\ninfections, skin problems and\ncancers that afflict those depressed\nimmune systems being developed to help this \nlonger and improved the quota Of\ntheir lives while \"awaiting\" or\nhoping for the final cure that may\ncause from research laboratories.\nA good example of this is the anti-fungal drug called\nSporanox which was launched in Mombasa this week by a Belgium firm Janssen. The drug is safer and .more effective against candidiasis that is becoming common in Aids patients."}
