{"text": "Aids: Why all must\nfight this horror\nKenyans must be told in the strongest terms possible that\nunless everybody joins in the war against Aids, this latter day\nplague will cause inestimable untimely deaths and\nsuffering. Although the first case' of the disease was\ndiagnosed in 1984, it is now projected that nearly 200,000\nKenyans may be having the virus, although the ,cumulative\nproven number is just over 19,000.\n, The incredibly fast rate at which it spreads should make\nmost people take practical steps to halt the spread of the\nlethal human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV). Although the\nproven number of those with Aids - the terminal stages of\nHIV infection - will surpass the 20,000 mark by the end of\nthe year, the estimates of the number 01 people who are\nhealthy carriers still sends a chill down the spine of any\nright-thinking person.\nWhy are people still getting infected despite what seems\nto be an aggressive national campaign to inform and\neducate Kenyans about the lethal disease? Although the\nactual figure is likely to less, having an estimated pool of\n200,000 HIV -carriers is not something that we can ignore\nbecause the consequences, as many Kenyans are beginning\nto realise, are devastating, the horror, complete.\nThe .Ministry of Health, with its meagre resources,\ncontinues to do its best to enable the country to control this\n'incurable infection which is still being taken for granted\neven by some highly educated people - including university\ngraduates. Last week, the Director of Medical Services said\nthat if Aids is to be curbed in Kenya and other African\nnations, there is need to deal with issues linked to low,\nliteracy rates, certain beliefs and cultural practices. '\nAids has killed many Kenyans because of an erroneous \nassumption that it is an old disease. This, as some people\nalready know, is a false and dangerous belief which will\nresult in some families, villages. and even clans being wiped\nout. Because of certain beliefs, there are still cases (if men.\n\"inheriting\" women whose husbands are known to have\ndied from Aids. This has been done even against medical\nadvice.\nIn Kenya, where all blood intended for transfusion must\nbe screened for HIV, the virus is mostly spread through\nheterosexual sex. This means that campaigns against the\nkiller disease must be conducted aggressively. There is need\nto constantly remind Kenyans that Aids will never be\neliminated if people do not stick to their., regular sex\npartners. There is no easy choice. Kenyans have to be told\nexplicitly that the days of easy sex are long gone.\nAlready, in a country like Uganda, authorities are\npredicting negative population growth unless a cure is\nfound. Those who monitor the world of biomedical research\nknow that the cure for Aids may not be found in the next\ndecade and if this is so, it means that millions of Kenyans\nwill die. '\nAlready, the impact of Aids is being felt even in public\ninstitutions such as the Kenyatta National Hospital where\nat least 30 children are \"stranded\" after acquiring infection\nfrom their mothers who clearly acquired the infection from\ntheir husbands or other sex partners.\nIndeed, the Director of Medical Services, Professor\nOliech, recently said that an increasing percentage of\nhospital beds is being taken by Aids patients, while some\ndiseases- like tuberculosis - which were about to be\ncontrolled, are on the rise because of Aids.\nThere is also an urgent need to ensure that needles and\nsyringes are sterilised because it is possible to link the\nspread of this lethal disease to negligence when, using 'such\nimplements. Our traditional medicinemen should be in the\nforefront of the war against Aids, especially in the area of\nmonitoring skin-piercing or cutting equipment'.\nHowever, it is sad that in 'some areas famous herbalists\ncheat people that Aids is a (cultural) curse although, in the\nnext five to 10 years, those who fail to adjust because of\n,such \u00b7beliefs will definitely be prematurely dead.\nIt is also important that our researchers continue to\nexamine how locally available drugs - such as Kemron and\nImmunex - may be used to minimise suffering, even if they\ndo not cure."}
