But after a year we still\nhave no Aids cases,\" he said.\n\"One year later they say the\nsame thing: 'You see, we are genetically\nresistant. Our local virus\nstrains are less virulent. It's a\nwestern problem'.\" .\nBut Mr Chin stressed that the\ncurrent Aids-related figures\nspeak for \u00b7themselves .\nUgandan President Yoweri Museveni, at yesterday's opening\nceremony, bluntly detailed its impact\non his impoverished East\nAfrican country, and said Western\ncalls for \"safer sex\" might\nhave little impact there.\n\"In a country where a woman\nmay have to walk five miles to get\naspirin, it may be difficult to get\na steady supply of condoms,\" he\nsaid.\nDeaths from Aids' in Uganda\nhe said, were hitting the economy ,\nby depleting the labour force.\nUganda and its neighbours are\nAfrica's worst hit countries, and\nsome estimates say one-third of\nits people' of child-producing age\n. may be infected with the virus.\n(Agencies)"}
