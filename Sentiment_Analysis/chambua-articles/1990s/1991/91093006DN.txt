{"text": "Meet the people\nand explain Aids\nThe Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Health Mr\nDaniel Mbiti, hit the nail on the head on Friday when he\nsaid that the National Aids Control secretariat should be\nmore aggressive, more visible in its campaign against the\ndreaded disease .\n.Mr Mbiti, when closing a two-day workshop on the fatal\ndisease, said Kenyans would like to see the men and women\nfrom the secretariat on television, hear them on the radio\nread about them in the print media and be seen by Kenyans\nwho live in rural areas.\nWhat Mr Mbiti was saying is that the people from the\nsecretariat seem to have adopted a low profile when they\nshould assume a high profile and visibility.\nWhat. he meant is that they should be all over the place,\nExplaining , counselling demonstrating and generally\ndisseminating every titbit of information available about\nAids. In a word, the men and women at the secretariat\nshould meet and talk to Kenyans; they should educate\nKenyans .\n. We concur with Mr Mbiti's views precisely because there\nIS as yet no cure for Aids and, therefore, the only way to\nhelp curb the spread of this disease is through educating\nKenyans about the disease.\nSecondly, the fear of the disease has spread faster than\nthe disease itself, giving rise to all sorts of views about the\ndisease and making it generally impossible for the\nrecipients of such \"grapevine\" information to make head or\ntail of what Aids is' all about.\nThe idea is for Kenya to be open about Aids and be\nforthcoming with information not only about its spread in\nthe country, but chiefly about how Kenyans can protect\nthemselves from this scourge and how they should relate\nwith people who either have the Aids-causing HIV virus or\nhave already gone down with full-blown Aids.\nThis has to be done with illustrations and\ndemonstrations, even where it involves the use of a condom\nfor the condom has to be of the right quality and size and\ninstructions as to how it should be used.\nThis reinforces the meet-with-the-people approach which\nMr Mbiti is advocating."}
