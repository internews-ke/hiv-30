{"text": "A people problem\nfor the continent\nAfrica's population in growing\nfaster than in any other region of\nthe world. Moreover, its rate of\nincrease has continued to\naccelerate. Elsewhere, growth\nrates are falling. By the end of\nthe century Africa's population,\nnumbering some 481 million in\n1981, will have almost doubled to\nover 800 million. Already, nearly\nhalf the continent's population is\nbelow the age of 15.\nAt the same time as this rapid\nrate of increase, the continent\ncontinues to have the highest\nmortality rates in the world, although\noverall death rates have\ngenerally declined during the\n1980s.\nAfrica's annual growth rate of\nsome three per cent (1985-90 average)\nis the highest of any region\nin the world. It compares with\naverages of less than 2-2.5 per\ncent in Asia and Latin America.\nPopulation growth rates exceeded\neconomic growth rates in\n32 African countries in the 1980s.\nIn only eight countries - Botswana,\nBurundi, Cameroon, Congo,\nEgypt, Lesotho, Seychelles and\nTunisia - was economic growth\nconsistently higher.\nAfrica has the world's lowest\nlife expectancy - 53 years. On average,\nan African child born in the\nfirst half of the 1980s could expect\nto live 14 years than his or\nher counterpart in Latin America,\n18 years less than a child born\nin East Asia and 25 years less\nthan a North American born during\nthe same period.\nAs well as the highest birth\nand death rates in the world,\nAfrica also has the highest fertility\nrate. On average, African\nwomen will give birth to six or\nmore children; their counterparts\nin Latin America will have four,\nin Asia three and in developed\ncountries only two.\nNearly one quarter of African\ncountries have a population of\none million or less.\nAfrica's economic crisis during\nmuch of the 1980s, its heavy debt\nburden and, in many cases, the\nimpact of structural adjustment programmes, have all made the\nimplementation of an effective\npopulation policy more difficult.\nMany countries have been compelled\nto relinguish medium and\nlong-term planning in favour of\nannual economic recovery plans\nin which a population component\nhas often been lacking. Severe resource\nconstraints and shifts in\npriorities have adversely affected\ninvestments in social sectors such\nas education and health, with direct\nconsequences for efforts to\nreduce mortality rates and a\nmore indirect impact on efforts\nto encourage family planning.\nIn many countries of central\nand eastern Africa thinly\nstretched health resources\nthreaten to be overwhelmed by .\nthe consequences of the spread of\nAids among the population.\nAlready nearly 6 million Africans\nhave been infected with HIV, the\nvirus that causes Aids, the World\nHealth Organisation estimates.\nAids-related deaths could reverse\nrecent progress in both adult and\nchild mortality rates, and lead to\na further fall in the share of the\nmost productive age-group in Africa's population.\nIn many countries there has\nbeen a serious and prolonged\nbreakdown in security, often coupled\nwith widespread food shortages\nor outright famine. Africa\nwith some 12 per cent of the\nworld's population, has more\nthan half of the world's refugees.\nIn this situation, much of the\nhoped\u00b7 for progress in slowing the\nrate of population increase, expanding\nfamily planning programmes and generally improving the health of the population\nhas been less than anticipated, or\nin some cases actually regressed,\nthe UN Population Fund\n(UNFP A) argues.\nThe relationship between population\ngrowth and development\nremains a complex and often controversial\none. At the 1984 Second\nAfrican Population Conference in Arusha, Tanzania, a\nconsensus was reached that population\nis a major development\nissue. Since then, the majority of\nAfrican countries have taken a\nrange of measures to tackle perceived\npopulation problems.\nAll countries - except for Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon,\nLibya and Somalia - have established\nMother and Child Health\nand Family Planning programmes\naimed at reducing maternal\nand infant mortality rates.\nNineteen African countries\nhave programmes designed to reduce\nfertility rates as part of their\ndevelopment plans. Two, Gabon\nand Libya, have encouraged an\nincrease in fertility rates.\nThe majority of governments\nhave taken some measures to try\nand reduce heavy migration to\nurban areas, or otherwise encourage\na better distribution of population. Despite heavy migration\nin recent years Africa still has\none of the lowest levels of\nurbanisation, with only one in\nthree people living in towns,\nagainst nearly one in two for the\nworld as a whole. \nTotal fertility rates remain\nunchanged in the majority of\ncountries. Only in 12 countries,\nover half of them in North Africa,\nhas there been a decrease.\nDeath rates in all countries\nfell between 1980-85 and 1986-90.\nHowever, child and maternal\nmortality rates failed to show any\ndramatic fall.\nThe last has important consequences\nfor population programmes.\nThere is a close relationship\nbetween levels of\nfertility and infant mortality. It\nhas been found that many developing\ncountries begin to experience\na significant decline in fertility\nrates when the under-5\nmortality rate falls into the general\nrange of 100-150 deaths per\n1,000 live births. However, by the\nend of the 1980s more than 30 African countries had child mortality\nrates of 150 or higher, while\nless than 10 were close to or below\n100 deaths per 1,000 live\nbirths.\nWomen's disadvantaged position\nwith respect to education,\nemployment, access to resources\nand decision-making power has\nalso been a major obstacle for reduction\nin fertility rates and thereby population growth\u2026 \ncultural resistance and lack of information on family Planning \nmethods and services continue to limit\nwomen's access, despite the majority\nof countries having adopted\nlaws and policies to promote\nthe status of women.\nSome countries have succeeded\nin making progress Botswana,\nMauritius and Zimbabwe all report\na high incidence of contraceptive\nuse. Djibouti, Mauritius,\nSomalia and a number of North\nAfrican countries have experienced\nfalling rates of population\ngrowth in the second half of the\n1980s.\nPriorities tor the 1990s\nMuch remains to be done. In the\nmajority of African countries\nthere is still a dire need for demographic\nsurvey information,' as '\nwell 88 socio-cultural research\ndata, including changes in the\nstatus of women. UNFPA says.\nDemographic policies and implementing\nmachinery need to be\nstrengthened and fully integrated\ninto longer term development .\nplanning. Public awareness of\nfamily planning services has\nincreased, but more need to be\ndone, particularly in rural areas.\nWith a few exceptions, government\nstructures for formulating\ninformation strategies on population\nissues are non-existent. And\nabove all there is an urgent need\nto increase the number of trained\npersonnel and improve the health\nand family planning infrastructure\nin the majority of African\ncountries.\nBased on information from\nthe UN Population Fund and\nother sources,\nTomorrow: The women factor."}
