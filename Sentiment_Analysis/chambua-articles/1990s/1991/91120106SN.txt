{"text": "Aids: The horror\ntakes its deadly toll\nYesterday was World Aids Day and after Kenya joined\nother nations to mark the day, the message that emerged\nwas that there is an urgent need to determine why more and\nmore people are being infected with this lethal disease\ndespite efforts to control its spread.\nOver 19,000 Kenyans have either developed Aids or have\ndied of complications related to it since 1985 and it is\nestimated that between 200,000 and 300,000 active and\nhealthy Kenyans are carriers of the Aids-causing HIV virus.\nIt is this and the fact that the virus spreads quickly and\nquietly to kill victims three, four or even 10 years later,\nwhich are the most -worrying. aspects of this latter-day\nplague.\nIt means that we shall wake up one morning to find that\nmillions have \"quietly\" perished leaving behind an\nenvironment of pain, poverty, large numbers of orphans,\nhuge medical debts, and diseases such as tuberculosis and\nassorted cancers.\nTherefore, after World Aids Day, there is a strong and\nurgent need for Kenyans to chart more vigorous strategies\nto curb the spread of Aids. Indeed, it should be recognised\nthat in Africa, especi8lly most of sub-Saharan Africa, there is already a \"high risk environment\".\nWe agree with the regional message from the World\nHealth Organisation regional office in Brazzaville that Aids poses a special and major problem for the continent where illiteracy runs high.\nPeople must be told repeatedly that there is still no cure for\nAids. There are a number of experimental vaccines and\ndrugs but there is still no proven cure and those infected\nwith the HIV virus will definitely die.\nIt is true that Kenyans may have two interferon based\ndrugs, Kemron and Immunex, but they are not cures\ndespite having the quality of \"easing\" a number of\nopportunistic infections in some Aids patients.\nPrevention remains the only hope to check the spread of\nAids; a disease that can wipe out entire families, even\ncommunities. Kenya has very effective radio programmes\ntranslated in various local languages to educate the people\nand help them prevent the spread of the disease.\nHowever, there are still people who choose not to believe\nthat the new disease kills. Their blind. drive or desire for sex\nhas not ebbed and they therefore still have sex with\nmultiple partners.\nKenyans just must stick to faithful sex partners. The\npenalty for engaging in sexual intercourse with a\nmultiplicity of partners is a death sentence. Kenya is indeed\nlucky to have the Know Aids Society which is doing its best\nto enlighten people on the dangers posed by the disease.\nThe society, which was founded by people such as Mr Joe\nMuriuki, who was the first Kenyan to tell the world that he\nwas an Aids-carrier, should be given more resources to help\ncombat Aids.\nThe National Aids Committee, religious organisations\nand all others should constantly remind their Kenyan\nbrethren that they should avoid this lethal infection by\nsticking to their sex partners.\nReligioius organisations, especially, can crusade against\ncustoms and habits or traditions that may expose people to\nthe disease.\nFinally, the success of the Aids control programme will\ndepend on how we treat those infected with the HIV virus.\nTheir active participation in the control of Aids is crucial\nand the experiences they have undergone, especially being\ndiscriminated against, should be part and parcel of the\nlessons to be imparted to Kenyans in the campaign against\nAids.\nThe craven and escapist way of looking at Aids as a\nproblem that \"belongs to others\" must be fought on all\nfronts, any time and all the time. The truth is that Aids\n,.. already threaten everybody. The truth is that AIDS\nKILLS INDISCRIMINATELY.\nSome nations which assumed a few years ago that Aids\nwas a disease for \"the immoral society\" in the West and\nAfrica are now faced with a serious Aids problem. Attempts\natconcea1mg our Aids problem in Ol.aer to attract tourists\nand investors are immoral in the extreme they are ugly and\nobviously myopic because, in most cases, Aids reached\nAfrica via international tourism.\n \"'Kenya, like other African nations, has to important. the\ntechnology needed to screen blood transfusion for \npresence of the Aids-causing virus. The country will import more drugs to treat opportunistic infections.\nOur message is this: Aids kills indiscriminately. AIDS is\n100 per cent fatal. In the absence of a cure, the only way to prevent its spread is for every Kenyan to religiously guard against indiscriminate sex.\nAs the MInister for Health, Mr Mwai Kibaki said once,\natu waache kutangatanga."}
