{"text": "Drug for Hepatitis B\nHepatitis B is' said to affect over 300 million people mostly in Asia and Africa, and there is a rush to control the disease through various vaccines including those derived from human blood and the genetically engineered ones.\nChinese researchers from the Shanghai Medical University have been attempting to stop the transmission of the Hepatitis B virus from mother to infant by using a vaccine that is genetically engineered from yeast.\nDuring the recent meeting of the International Clinical Epidemiology Network(INCLEN) held in Mombasa, the Chinese researchers presented a paper saying that the vaccine derived from yeast was safe and effective and could replace plasma derived vaccines which has the potential of transmitting the lethal HIV virus.\nHowever, the protection to infants whose mothers had Hepatitis B, or were carriers of the virus, ranged from 51 to 75 per cent which the Chinese doctors say is similar to results from the vaccine derived from blood plasma. With the chances of getting AIDS from blood products increasing the vaccine derived from yeast has an added advantage."}
