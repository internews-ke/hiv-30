Father Angelo D\u2019Agostino, says.\u2028\n\u201cWith Aids cases on the increase, the number of children to be orphaned as a result of the disease will increase tremendous1y as we enter the new millennium,\u201d he said. \u2028\nFather D\u2019Agostino was speaking yesterday during a courtesy call by Mama Ngina\u2028\nKenyatta at the children\u2019s home at Karen.\u2028\nHe said time had come for Kenyans to face the reality of the disease and join the government in fighting.\u2028\nEven with the awareness campaign on the disease, Kenyans were doing little in fighting the disease, he said.\u2028\nThe chairman of the home, Mr Denis Afande said more effort was required to assist children suffering from Aids.\u2028\n\u201cChildren\u2019s homes are not the only alternative to young people suffering from Aids. The whole Kenyan community should feel responsible to cater\u2028\nfor such children,\u201d he said.\u2028\nHe also urged Kenyans to assist non-governmental organizations or individuals taking care of such children, saying the majority donors were from overseas.\u2028\nMama Ngina who donated foodstuffs to the home, pledged to offer assistance to the institution, saying that such homes were a good example of what\u2028\nwas needed to be done by all Kenyans.\u2028\nFather Agostino urged the government to waive taxes on donations made to the home from overseas. High taxes discouraged donors, he said.\u2028\nThe home caters for children\u2028\nwho are HIV-positive and currently has 120 children.\u2028\nOthers present at the function\u2028\nincluded Mr Ephraim Gathaiya\u2028\nthe general manager of the\nhome, Margaret Kenyatta,\u2028\nMr Muhoio Kenyatta and Ms\u2028\nNyokabi Kenyatta."}
