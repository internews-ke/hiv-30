150,000 children in Kenya are HIV positive

By NATION Correspondent 
More than 150,000 children in 
Kenya are HIV-positive, the founder of the Nyumbani Children’s Home. Father Angelo D’Agostino, says. 
“With Aids cases on the increase, the number of children to be orphaned as a result of the disease will increase tremendous1y as we enter the new millennium,” he said.  
Father D’Agostino was speaking yesterday during a courtesy call by Mama Ngina 
Kenyatta at the children’s home at Karen. 
He said time had come for Kenyans to face the reality of the disease and join the government in fighting. 
Even with the awareness campaign on the disease, Kenyans were doing little in fighting the disease, he said. 
The chairman of the home, Mr Denis Afande said more effort was required to assist children suffering from Aids. 
“Children’s homes are not the only alternative to young people suffering from Aids. The whole Kenyan community should feel responsible to cater 
for such children,” he said. 
He also urged Kenyans to assist non-governmental organizations or individuals taking care of such children, saying the majority donors were from overseas. 
Mama Ngina who donated foodstuffs to the home, pledged to offer assistance to the institution, saying that such homes were a good example of what 
was needed to be done by all Kenyans. 
Father Agostino urged the government to waive taxes on donations made to the home from overseas. High taxes discouraged donors, he said. 
The home caters for children 
who are HIV-positive and currently has 120 children. 
Others present at the function 
included Mr Ephraim Gathaiya 
the general manager of the
home, Margaret Kenyatta, 
Mr Muhoio Kenyatta and Ms 
Nyokabi Kenyatta.
