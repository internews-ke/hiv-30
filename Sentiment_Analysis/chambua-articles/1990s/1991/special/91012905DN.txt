Vaccine stirs hopes
By YANN TESSIER
FLORENCE (Italy), Thursday
Scientists said today they had developed
an Aids vaccine now being tested on humans which may give long-term protection against the deadly disease. 
Dr Josef Manhalter, a researcher for the Swiss-based Immuno International AG group of companies said chimpanzees
given the vaccine resisted infection
for over 30 months from the HIV virus which causes Aids -
Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome.
"This is the longest lasting immunity
known to date, said Dr
Manhalter, presenting the results
of his research at the seventh International
Aids Conference.
, He told Reuters in an interview
that clinical trials on 60 human
volunteers were: already under
way and results were expected in
a few months.,
But Dr Manhalter said the vaccine
still faced a rigorous testing
programme and even if it fulfilled
its early promise, a commercially
available vaccine was still several
years away.
The virus destroys the body's
defences against disease by infecting
and killing selected white
blood cells called T4 lymphocytes.
