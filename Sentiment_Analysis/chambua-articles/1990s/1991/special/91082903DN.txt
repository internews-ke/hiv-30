150,000 children in Kenya are HIV positive

By NATION Correspondent

More than 150,000 children in
Kenya are HIY-positive, the
founder of the Nyumbani Children's
Home, Father Angelo
D' Agostino, says.
"With Aids cases on the increase,
the number of children to
be orphaned as a result of the
-disease will increase tremendously as we enter the new millennium,"
he said.
Father D' Agostino was
speaking yesterday during a
courtesy call by Mama Ngina
Kenyatta at the children's home
at Karen.
He said time had come for
Kenyans to face the reality of the
disease and join the government
in fighting it.
Even with the awareness campaign
on the disease, Kenyans
were doing little in fighting the
disease, he said.
The chairman of the home,
Mr Denis Afande, said more effort
was required to assist children
suffering from Aids.
"Children ~s homes are not
the only alternative to young people suffering from Aids. The
whole (Kenyan community
should fed responsible to cater
for such children," he said.
He also urged Kenyans to assist
non-governmental organizations
or individuals taking care
_of such children, saying the majority
of donors were from
overseas.
Mama Ngina, who donated
foodstuffs to the home, pledged
to offer assistance to the institution,
saying that such homes
were a good example of what
was needed to be done by all
Kenyans.
Father )' Agostino urged the government 1t to waive taxes on
donations made to the home
from overseas. High taxes discouraged
donors, he said.
The home caters for children
who are HIV-positive and currently
has 120 children.
Others present at the function
included r IIr Ephraim Gathaiya
the genes al manager of the
home,  Margaret Kenyatta,
Mr Muho 10 Kenyatta and Ms
Nyokabi Kenyatta.
