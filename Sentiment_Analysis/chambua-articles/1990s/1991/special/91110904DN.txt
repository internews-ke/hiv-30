Blood screening a must-Siangok
By NATION Correspondent
The director of the National Public Health Laboratory Services, Dr T. K. Siangok, yesterday said the Goverment had directed that all blood intended for transfusion be screened for HIV, syphilis and hepatitis.
The directive follows research findings indicating that blood transfusions could be increasing incidents of hepatitis infection among recipients.
Dr Siangok said this while closing a four-day workshop on Posttransfusion Hepatitis at the
Kenya Medical Research Institute (Kernri). The workshop was organised by Kemri in conjunction with the Japanese Intern International Co-operation Agency (JICA).
It was attended by 15 laboratory technologists from provincial and district hospitals.
Dr Siangok said that to implement the Government's policy of improving health deliverly facilities, different cadres of health specialists had been posted to district and provincial hospitals.
This, he said had rapidly improved the health-care delivery system.
He said that although hepatitis did not get as much publicity as Aids, it was a much bigger problem because of its morbidity and mortality. Epidemiological evidence showed that hepatitis incidents increased with age.
