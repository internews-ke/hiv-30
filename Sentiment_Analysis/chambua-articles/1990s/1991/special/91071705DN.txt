Women in greatAids risk'

CHICAGO, Wednesday

Heterosexual men infected with
the virus that causes Aids are at
least 17.5 times more likely to
give the infection to women during
sex rather than the other way
around, according to a study that
supports previous findings.
investigators in the study published
today tested the sex partners
of 72 infected women and
307 infected men to determine
the rates of HIV transmission between
the heterosexual couples.
The researchers said they
found that just one man had become
infected by the woman, and
even that case was inconclusive
since both partners said they had
had many unprotected sex encounters
with other partners before
their relationship.
Sixty-one, or 20 percent, of the
women had been infected by the
man, according to the study. The
study expands on a preliminary
report last year suggesting men
were 14 times more likely to give
the virus to women (AP) .
