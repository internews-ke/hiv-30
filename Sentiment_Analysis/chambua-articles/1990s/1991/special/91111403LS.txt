{"text": "Could I be HIV-Positive?\u2028\nQ Dear June, I am 17 years old and I have\u2028\nhad a problem for some time. I took an\u2028\nHIV test a while ago and the results were\u2028\nnegative. Despite that fact, I still think I\u2019m\u2028\nHIV positive. What can 1 due to eliminate the\u2028\nfear and anxiety and accept the fact that I\u2028\nam HIV negative?\u2028\nAlexander\n\nA Alexander, thank you for your letter. You sound extremely\u2028\nworried that you are H IV-positive despite the test showing\u2028\nthat you are negative. Yes, it must have been very difficult for\u2028\nyou to take the test after suspecting that you may have\u2028\ncontracted the KIV virus.\u2028\nAlexander, you seem preoccupied with the fact that you\u2028\nmay develop the Aids symptoms. From what you\u2019ve shared, I\u2028\ncan see that It is extremely hard for you to focus your mind on\u2028\nanything when you believe that you will die soon as there is no\u2028\ncure for Aids.\u2028\nAlex, many people continue to feel they have the HIV virus\u2028\neven after they have taken the HIV test numerous times and the\u2028\nresults are negative. They also continue to worry even if they\u2028\nare not exposing themselves to the virus. These people are\u2028\ncalled the worried well and are usually uneasy and scared\u2028\nabout the possibility of having the illness.\u2028\nLet us look at three reasons that could contribute to that Not knowing how the virus is transmitted\u2028\nBelief by some people that they have whatever disease\u2028\nthat happens to be attracting attention at that lame Feeling of guilt about past sexual behaviour.\u2028\nAlex, your anxiety about AIDS may make you adore\u2028\ndepressed than a person who knows he is H IV-positive. That\u2028\nstate of fear can actually cause signs that will appear to you\u2028\nlike you are -IIV-positive. These include fatigue, sweating,\u2028\nweight loss, diarrhea, and these are also found n people who\u2028\nare very anxious and depressed. So, you can see that these\u2028\nsigns can confirm your worst fears - that you are positive, when\u2028\nactually, you are not! When you are anxious and depressed,\u2028\nthese feelings can make it difficult to accept the results of a\nblood test.\u2028\nI would strongly suggest that you talk to your guidance\u2028\nand counselling teacher about your distress. He or she could\u2028\nalso give you more information on Aids. If you have put\u2028\nyourself at risk of getting HIV in the past, and you\u2019re feeling\u2028\nguilty about it, talking it out would help you come to terms\u2028\nwith it. You could then avoid sex and prioritise on your\u2028\nstudies. I would also suggest that you keep yourself busy in\u2028\ndoing things that you like. Have time to socialize and get\u2028\ninvolved in some sports. Decide to develop a talent that you\u2028\nhave. Art or poetry may put you at ease otherwise, I wish you\u2028\npeace of mind."}
