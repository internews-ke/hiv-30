{"text": " HIV story was moving\n1 was deeply touched by the October 31 lead\nstory in the Young Nation titled I am HIV Positive. It\ndid not only show that Aids is real but also gave\nan account of how we acquire Aids in ways that we\ncan avoid. Not every one will be as lucky as our\nfellow young man who confessed. So it is time the\nyouth changed their life style. The biggest mistake\nwe make is to think that it can only infect other\npeople and not us and this ignorance is what will\nwipe us out if we do not change. The best thing to\ndo is to live with a notion that everyone else is\ninfected apart from you and you will be safe. Once\nmore I would like to thank the Young Nation team\nfor this true reflection and we hope you keep up/\nthe good work. . ///\nBernard N G, Kerugoya.\n\n/\nCan the Narrator Contact me?\nThank you for the story titled I am HIV positive\nwhich was narrated to Tim Kamuzu Bandaand featured in the YoungNation, October 31.\nI am very convinced that the article has been a\nLesson to many youth countrywide.
