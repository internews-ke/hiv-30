 HIV story was moving
1 was deeply touched by the October 31 lead
story in the Young Nation titled I am HIV Positive. It
did not only show that Aids is real but also gave
an account of how we acquire Aids in ways that we
can avoid. Not every one will be as lucky as our
fellow young man who confessed. So it is time the
youth changed their life style. The biggest mistake
we make is to think that it can only infect other
people and not us and this ignorance is what will
wipe us out if we do not change. The best thing to
do is to live with a notion that everyone else is
infected apart from you and you will be safe. Once
more I would like to thank the Young Nation team
for this true reflection and we hope you keep up/
the good work. . ///

Can the Narrator Contact me?
Thank you for the story titled I am HIV positive
which was narrated to Tim Kamuzu Bandaand featured in the YoungNation, October 31.
I am very convinced that the article has been a
Lesson to many youth countrywide. They should
understand that AIDS is not a respecter of certain
persons and it will destroy anyone who is careless
about his/her sex life. \
The Young Notion should keep up the good
work and I would very much have loved the narrator
of the story to contact me using the address
given below.

Give me the contact of the
counsellor
The story titled I am HIV positive which
Young Notion carried on October 31 was educational
and an eye-opener. I am a young man of
a similar age as the narrator of the story and
just like him, I am in one of the city's colleges.
I would like to know how I can get in touch
with the counsellor who has helped this young
man. I might also be suffering from the same
problem and I need help.
Young person! .â€¢Nairobi
