Advertisers pondering what to do with Magic
NEW YORK, Saturday
"Magic Johnson's stunning admission
that he has been infected
with the virus that causes Aids
creates a dilemma for marketers
that have paid the popular athlete
handsomely for commercial
endorsements.
What do they do now?
Some advertising experts said
people are so afraid of the disease
that Johnson's career as an effective product pitchman is over.
But others say the admission
made him a hugely sympathetic
figure and that companies who
drop him risk alienating customers.
They say there would be no
more compelling spokesman at
the movement than Johnson.
Some suggest companies could
score a huge public relations coup
by helping underwrite the Aids
education campaign that Johnson
wants to pursue.
A public service campaign like
that could address a growing
national problem, secure a company's
reputation as a solid citizen
and help sales, they say.
The Los Angeles Lakers basketball
superstar, .caught nearly
everyone by surprise on Thurs.
day in disclosing that he had the
HVI virus, which causes the incurable aids disease, and was retiring
from the pro basketball.
Several sports talent agents
said the disclosure probably ended
Johnson's commercial career
as well. Consistently rated among the most popular athlete endorsers,
Johnson makes an estimated
$2m to $12m a year from commercials
and other promotions.
His roster of recent sponsorship
ties include Pepsi-Cola Co.,
Converse Inc., Kentucky Fried
Chicken, Target Stores, Spalding
Sports Worldwide and Nestle
Foods Co. Those companies expressed
support for Johnson but
were non committal about plans
to use him in future promotions.
Minneapolis-based Target Evidently
is the only company currently
using Johnson in advertising.
Spokesman George Hite told
the Saint Paul Pioneer Press no
change were being made in that
campaign that runs until next
Friday.
Nestle announced five weeks
ago that it had signed Johnson to
a two-year contract to appear for'
its nestle' crunch candy' bar, but
hasn't aired ads yet.
"We support "Magic," Frank Arthofer, the president of Nestle
Chocolate and Confection Co.
Inc., said in 'a statement yesterday.
"We await the opportunity
to discuss our next step with"
him"
Advertisers generally shy away
from celeblities who have personal
problems for. fear that they
could reflect negatively on their
products. David Burns, who
. heads a service matching athletes
and advertisers in Chicago, said
he expected any company with
ads featuring Johnson on the air
would quit using them.
But Vangie Hayes, who hires
actors and celebrities for advertisements
created by J. Walter
Thompson,  said such decisions
would depend of how Johnson
was used.
His infection with the Aids virus
probably means he would no
longer be effective in advertisements
emphasising his good
health and high energy, she said..
But she said advertisers could
probably find some other way to
use Johnson, such as by sponsoring
the public service campaign
 against Aids for which he has volunteered
to be the spokesman.
Lloyed Kolmer;" a new York based
talent negotiator, said
Johnson is so well-like that he
"won't lose a dime" on· current
endorsement affiliations.
"I don't think he'll get new endorsements
but I am positive
that the people who now employ
him will not pull away from him
now," Kolmer said.
Michael Hughes, vice-chairman
'had creative. director at the
Martin Agency, an advertising
agency in Richmond, Virginia
said Johnson is "one of the few.
heroes out there' and his candid
admission of infection didn't diminish
that.
"If you are an advertiser, there
should be a lot of rewards tying
into a guy who is 'still a hero but
is now fighting ·on a different
court" Hughes said. "He may be
the most believable endorser in
the world now"
But at the same time, he said
companies would have to be careful
in how' they used Johnson to
avoid looking like crass
opportunists.
