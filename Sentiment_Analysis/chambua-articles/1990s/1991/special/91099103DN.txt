‘Ndombolo’ linked to Aids spread

By NATION Reporter 
The popular Congolese dance, 
Ndombolo, should be banned because it is contributing to the spread of Aids, the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of 
Health, Prof Julius Meme, says. 
He also wants all sexually explicit magazines, currently on sale in the streets; banned, saying they are corrupting the morals of young Kenyans. 
Prof Meme said research had shown that the Ndombolo dance  was dangerous and is causing havoc to the young people”. 
He was speaking at Club Sun and Sands in Mombasa when he officially opened the sixth annual meeting of the African epidemiology Network. 
He said the dance was sexually suggestive and drove many 
Kenyans to casual sex, leading to the spread of Aids. 
He said there was no hope of ever winning the minds of grown Ups as far as sexual behaviour was concerned, adding that the only way out was to protect the youth by exposing them to the right information. 
Speaking on the same subject, an Aids researcher, Dr

Joel. P. Ralcawar said unless politicians confronted the Aids epidemic openly, Kenyans will be dying at the rate of I, 000 people a day in the next two to three years. 
He said the Head of State should lead the way by making debate on Aids a national issue at every forum. 
Dr Rakawar said there was no need to target the grownups in Kenya any more for they already know the consequences of 
HIV. 
“Mature Kenyans have chosen to ignore the fact that HIV is prevalent and our duty now is to protect those who have no idea about the disease. These are the very young ones,” said 
Dr Rakawar, a lecturer at the University of Nairobi. 
He concern over the resistance of the church to teaching of family life education in schools. 
Others who raised concern over the resistance of the church to family life education in schools included the deputy director of Medical Services, Dr 
Peter Katuruku.
