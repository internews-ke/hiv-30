I meant no harm, Magic tells women

BASKETBAll

NEW YORK; Wednesday
Magic Johnson was only joking
when he told sports illustrated
that he tried to "accommodate as
many women" as he could and
says "I respect women to the utmost"
in 'a broadcast interview to
air Wednesday.
Johnson also told CBS interviewer
Connie Chung he has suffered
no side effects from taking
the Aids drug AZT, and admitted
tennis star Martina Navratilova
was probably right in saying the
public would not have been supportive
of her if she had the aids
virus.
Johnson announced on
November 7 that he was retiring
from basketball with the Los Angeles Lakers because he had contracted
HIV, the virus that
causes Aids. Since then, the has
become a national spokesman for
the disease.
'Johnson authored a Sports Illustrated
article with Roy Johnson
for the issue that came out
after his announcement in which
he said he contracted the virus
through heterosexual, unprotected
sex.
In transcripts obtained by the
Associated Press, however, John-son told Chung: "We were just
talking and I said that in a jokingly
manner ... when you interpret that, you think 'ah, he's just
sleeping with everybody,' And
that's not like that. Not at all...
When you say I tried a accommodate
all these women, then
you get into a disrespect for
women, and I - I'm not like that.
I really respect women, and I just
should've been protecting myself,
as well as my partner, and I
didn't." Johnson said "I used a bad
choice of words," and admitted
again that he "lived a bachelor's
life at that particular time. And
I'm paying' the price for it."
Johnson said his AZT treatments
had produced no ill side
effects, which can include Anemia,
Nausea and muscle pain.
"I've run four miles a day, I lift
weights," he said. Shortly after
Johnson's ' announcement,
Navratilova, who is gay, complained
of a double standard in
American society. She said that
while Johnson was cast as a hero,
people would have said she deserved
it if she had made a similar
announcement - and society
would have castigated any heterosexual
woman found in such a
situation. (AP)
