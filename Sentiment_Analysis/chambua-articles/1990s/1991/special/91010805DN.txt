By NATION Correspondent 
More than 40 million people 
worldwide will be infected with 
the deadly Human immune Virus 
(HIV) and several million children left parentless by the year 
2000 a workshop In Mombasa 
has been told. 
Already, one in every 250 
adults in the world is infected 
and this will no doubt impoverish 
the economies, the trade and 
even the social stability of many 
countries, according to a paper 
presented at the workshop. 
The paper titled Development 
Dimensions of the HIV Epidemic, delivered during a three-week 
workshop which ends at the 
Mombasa Beach Hotel on 
November 1, the worldwide HIV 
epidemic was spreading at an 
ever increasing rate. 
The workshop funded by the 
United Nations Development 
Programme, (UNDP) has training consultants from various 
parts of the world. The are six 
Kenyans. 
According to a Canadian, 
Larry de Bolee, training constant, the workshop was design 
for senior United Nation and senior Government officials particularly from the Ministries of Economic Planning, Finance, 
Agriculture, Industries and 
Transport. 
He said Kenya was selected to 
be the venue of the international 
workshop due to the wide experience of officials concerned with 
Aids awareness in Kenya. 
Mr Boice said that after the 
workshop, a number of five-day 
residential workshops would be 
offered in countries where the 
UNDP resident representatives 
and governments requested and : 
actively supported such 
assistance. 
He said that pilot workshops 
would be offered in Africa, the 
Caribbean and the Pacific from 
the beginning of next year.
