The forum also said NGOs will be consulted and requested to give financial support.\u2028\nThe Aids problem will be part of the agenda of issues to be addressed during the national holidays, public meetings and barazas.\u2028\nThe leaders, who included Members of Parliament from the province, observed that the rate at which HIV/Aids was spreading was alarming. They all called for collective social responsibility in dealing with the pandemic.\n\nPeople infected with HIV and those who have the symptoms\u2028\nfor Aids should be treated at home as their numbers in hospitals had doubled and was causing a serious congestion in the institutions.\u2028\nThe community will be encouraged to take care of the patients and reduce the stigma associated with HIV/Aids infection.\u2028\nLeaders appealed to the government to put up in place the legal framework for the implementation of the Sessional Paper to hasten the establishment of a\u2028\nNational Aids Council.
