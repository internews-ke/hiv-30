I approached them and enquired about the direction to the\u2028\nclinic undertaking Aids tests on\u2028\nstudents travelling abroad. I was\u2028\nsome leaving for Poona University in India, I said.\u2028\n\u201cOne of the women pulled me\u2028\naside and whispered: \u2018You have\u2028\nbeen told about the amount of.\u2028\nmoney you should pay?\u2018.\u2028\n\u201cI told her I\u2019d been advised I\u2028\ncould easily get one for Sh200 but\u2028I didn\u2019t\u2019 know where to obtain one.\u2028\n\u201cShe told me it was not Sh200 but Sh350, adding:\u2019 \u2018But you can get the other one (genuine) at an even higher fee and never go to\u2028\nIndia. You know, sometimes they\u2028\ncan even indicate you have Aids\u2028\nbecause some people are jealous\u2028\nend do not want others to go out\u2028\nof the country\u2019.\u2028\n\u201cShe told me the process involved in the genuine one\u2028\nwas very long and if they detected\u2028\neven a minor disease I wouldn\u2019t\u2028\ngo to India.\u2028\n\u201cAfter the lecture, I finally\u2028\nyielded and agreed to part with\u2028\nSh3&) as she did not have loose\u2028\nchange.\u2028\u2018Where are the university\u2028\nforms.\u2019 the middle-aged woman\u2028\nasked me. \u00a1 pretended to Iive\u2028\nforgotten to carry them feigning\u2028\nIgnorance that I didn\u2019t think they\u2028\nwere required.\u2028\n\u201cThe woman handed me a yellow piece of paper, advised me to\n\nwrite my official names, wrap up\u2028\nthe money with it and give it to\u2028\nthem. All these took place at an isolated corner where I had been\u2028\ntaken to.\u2028\n\u201cThe woman then instructed\u2028\nme to wait for her on the verandah while she processed the\u2028\ncertificate.\u2028\n\u201cAfter about 15 minutes, she\u2028\nemerged from a room along the\u2028\nverandah, gave me a rectangular\u2028\npiece of paper and asked me to\u2028\nexamine it to see whether I was\u2028\nsatisfied. It was complete with\u2028\nthe hospital\u2019s address and stamp,\u2028\na reference number, date the title\u2028\nMedical Certificate HTLV, and\u2028\na signature, supposedly a\u2028\ndoctor\u2019s.\u2028\n\u201cIt seemed in order and I said\u2028\nas much. The woman then told\u2028\nme not to disclose to anybody\u2028\nhow 1 obtained the certificate.\u2028\n\u201c if anybody asks you where\u2028\nyou got it, just say it is from Kenyatta National Hospital because\u2028\nif the Government knows about\u2028\nthis, the man who helped me get\u2028\nit may Lose his job\u2019, she told me.\u2028\n\u201cShe had something else to\u2028\nsay. \u2018You know, I knew this man\u2028\nwhen my brother\u2019s son wanted to\u2028\ngo abroad and he helped me get\u2028\nhis certificate. I would not want\u2028\nhim to lose his job. I quickly left\u2028\nthe hospital and returned to the\u2028\noffice.\u2028\nThe letter HTLV on the certificate stand for Human T. Lymphocyte Virus, the old name for\u2028\nthe Aids virus. The current name\n\nis HIV for Human Immuno-Deficiency Virus. \u2018\u2028\n. The certificate reads: \u201cThis is\u2028\nto certify that ...has been examined and tested negative for\u2028\nHTLV. On ciLnical examination, no abnormalities detect\u2028\ned. HTLV (Eiisa)-Negative.\u2028\nUrinalysis-Nad. Stool -normal.\u2028\nContacted for a comment, the\u2028\ndirector of the hospital, Dr Nelson Agata, dismissed the certificate as a forgery and denied any\u2028\nknowledge of a scandal involving\u2028\nAids tests.\u2028\n\u201cWhat I know is that we officially charge these students going\u2028\nto India ShlOO per person for a\u2028\nfull medical examination, which\u2028\nincludes an AIDS test,\u201d the director said. \nPr Agata has a copy of the \u201cbogus\u2019 certificate which we gave\u2028\nhim.\u2028\nOn Mondy, a 23-year-old student (name withheld) told the\u2028\nNation it took him 10 minutes to\u2028\nget his certificate. He is scheduled to leave for India on July 15.\u2028\nHe told us he had arrived at\u2028\nthe hospital it 2 pm and enquired\u2028\nfrom a security guard where the\u2028\nAids testing office was. The\u2028\nguard took him inside a room and\u2028\ntold him to wait. He returned\u2028\nwith another man in a suit.\u2028\nThe man told the student to\u2028\nproduce the money to \u201ccatalyse\u2028\nthe process\u201d and enable him to\u2028\nget the certificate immediately\u2028\nand without much fuss.\u2028\nThe student told us: \u201cI went\u2028\nthere (KNH to get an HIV test\u2028\nas required by the Ministry of\u2028\nEducation, but I was shocked to\u2028\nbe issued with a certificate saying\u2028\nthat [am medically fit and HJV\u2028\nnegative, 10 minutes later even\u2028\nbefore 1 was examined and tested.\u201d"}
