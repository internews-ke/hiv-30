Train counsellors, says donâ€¨
By NATION Correspondent

Health workers should be given
training in counselling as a strategy
to lengthen the lives of people
who have tested HIV positive.
Dr Elizabeth Ngugi, a lecturer
in community health at the University
of Nairobi says efficient
counselling of people with HIV
enabled them live longer with the
virus before succumbing to full-blown
Aids. She said majority of
health workers lack sufficient
training on counselling.
The lecturer said the basic
training curriculum for health
workers was reviewed only last
September to include a course on
counselling targeting HlV /Aids.

She said none of the serving
health workers had sufficient
skills to counsel Aids patients
"unless they had sought additional
training" .
She was speaking on the second
day of a leaders' workshop on
home-based care for Aids patients
at Kisumu's Museum view Hotel
last weekend.
Home-based care, the workshop
heard, should be promoted
as a strategy for reducing the stigmatization
that is often associated
with Aids.
The workshop is jointly organized
by the UK-based Mid may
International and the Futures
Group International who are implementing a new initiative against the spread of AIDS in Nyanza Province.
