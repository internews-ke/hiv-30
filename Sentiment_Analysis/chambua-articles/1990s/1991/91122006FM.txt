{"text": "'Look out for HIV, watch out for STDs\nAlthough the human, immune deficiency virus (HIV) currently dominates public attention, other\nsecondary sexually transmitted\ndiseases (STDs) are a major and\ngrowing problem in their own\nmight ... '\nThe chances of being infected\nwith STDs are much greater for\nmost people than becoming infected\nwith HIV, according to an\narticle published in \"IPPF Medical\nBulletin\" Vol. 25 No.5 of\nOctober 1991 by Michael Rosenberg.\nThis is because other STDs\nare more common than HIV.\nThe writer explains that infection\nwith a viral STD, like herpes,\ncan cause recurrent discomfort\nand debility for life and some\nSTDs, such. as pelvic inflammatory\ndisease (PID), can be fatal.\n'He reports that one of the findings\nof HIV stimulated research\nis that the risk of acquiring\nSTDs, including HIV, can be reduced\nby using certain contraceptives.\nBehanioural research conducted\nduring the AIDs epidemic\nhas shown that since contraceptives\nare used by many sexually\nactive people, it may be more\npractical to seek change in the\ntype of contraceptives used than\nto try and induce long-term lifestyle\nchanges, like reducing the\nnumber of partners, which is\nprobably unrealistic.\nThe writer stresses the importance\nof contraception and STDs\nfor women because they bear a\ndisproportionate share of the\nhealthier burden imposed by\nSTDs in form of PID, ectopic\npregnancy, infertility and cervical\ncancer. Women also frequently\nassume responsibility for contraception partly because more, options are available for women\nthan men.\nSTDs are more readily transmitted\nfrom men to women, more\ndifficult to diagnose in women\nand require longer antibiotic\ntreatment to cure m women than\nin men.\nThe article, entitled Contraception and STDs, reviews various experiments carried out to\ndetermine the efficiency condoms, barrier methods, spermicides, oral contraceptives\n(OCs) and inter-uterine devices\n(IUDs) in protecting against\nSTDs.\nThe writer concludes that OCs\nand IUDs which are most effective\nin preventing pregnancy, are\nleast effective in protecting\nagainst STDs while condoms,\nspermicides and barriers provide\nthe greatest STD protection although they are least effective in\npreventing pregnancy.\nThe best protection against\npregnancy and disease would\ntherefore be 'a combination of two\nmethods which is difficult to.\nsustain in practice. The writer\ncautions those making recommendations to a balance between whether the method is being used\nto prevent pregnancy or disease\nand acceptability, availability and\ncost of using the method as well\nas providing different options to\nallow an individual to select the\nbest contraceptive."}
