It is an advertisement and not a report to disseminate information.\"\nHe said Kenya depended on tourism to earn foreign exchange but the Standard story could scare away tourists.\nMr Nassir said Kenya did not have the highest number of Aids patients and Mr Opar should have 'advised leaders on what to do to contain the menace. He even questioned the authenticity of the figures given saying all the figures quoted in the three newspapers were different. But on a point of order, the MP for Bahari, Mr Mtana Lewa; dismissed the point of order from Mr Nassir as incompetent.\" Mr Nassir is not qualified to talk about Aids. We should have expected an authoritative, statement from the Minister for Health and not a rejoinder from Mr Nassir.\"\nOn another point of order, Mr Joash wa Mang'oli (Webuye) accused Prof Oliech of promoting\nanti-Aids drugs from America at\nthe expense of Kemron and\nsought to be told what interest\nthe director had in the matter.\nYesterday, Prof Oliech said the\ncumulative number of people\nwhich Aids since 1984 when the\nfirst case was reported was just:.\nabove 19,000 and the projected\nnumber of carriers (those not yet\ntested) was 200,000.\n\"Even the cumulative global\nfigures officially reported to the\nWorld Health Organisation (are)\nfar below the reported 700,000\nwhich is even higher by all other\nprojections,\" he added.\nProf Oliech went on: \"There is need for the media, and even our\nlocal experts, to understand and\ncorrectly interpret data on Aids.\"\nAbout reports, of the Aids-infected\nKodiaga prison inmates,\nProf Oliech said the Ministry of\nHealth had not screened the\ncountry's prison population to\ndetermine the total number of\nthose infected with the Aids\nvirus.\n\"Prison inmates are screened\nwhen they are donating blood\nand when they are admitted to\nhospital,\" Prof Oliech said and\nadded that it was only the Provincial\nMedical Officer who could\ntell the actual number of inmates\ninfected with the Aids virus.\n\"And for such figures to be given,\nthey must be based on actual\ndata,\"'-Prof, Oliech said.\nPrisons sources told the\nNation that the number of inmates\ntesting HIV -positive \"were\non the rise and attributed this to\nhomosexuality among, some of\nthe inmates. '\nThe sources said the situation\nwas aggravated by a shortage of\nuniforms which saw some of the\nprisoners going nearly naked in\nthe congested prisons.\nMedical sources said inmates\ninfected with the Aids virus were\nbeing brought to the hospital\nwhen they were terminally ill.\nBut the Nyanza Provincial\nPrisons Commandant, Mr Abraham\nKhamali, denied the reports\nof Ai(ls-infected inmates. \"Any\ninmate who has the virus contracted\nit before he was imprisoned.\nWe do not know anything\nabout that here. The sources of\ninformation must be bitter\npeople,\" Mr Khamali said.\n'Efforts to contact the Provincial\nMedical Officer, Dr Michael\nAmolo\" were fruitless as he was\nreported to be out of the office.\nMeanwhile, the Kisumu Medical\nOfficer, Dr J. Sule, yesterday\nsaid a team of doctors had been\nsent to the Kodiaga and Kibor\nprisons to examine the inmates.\nDr Sule said he had been instructed\nby Dr Amolo to send the\nmedical team to the two prisons."}
