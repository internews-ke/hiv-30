{"text": "Soybean - might cure Aids\nPreliminary research encouraging\nBy NGUGI wa MBUGUA\nSoybean, that close relative of the\nbean, might have some Aids virus\ndestructive value.\nA Japanese microbiologist\nwalked into Nation House recently\nwith cuttings from the Nigerian\nPress indicating a preliminary\nbreakthrough in research to\nthat effect.\nDr Kiyoaki Katoh is a senior\ninformation and research officer\nwith the Tropical Agriculture Research\nCentre (TRAC) of the.Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry,\nThe news items were published\nin Nigeria last year. One of them,\ndated August I, quotes an official\nof the Nigerian Soybean Association\n(NSA) saying that soybeans\ncan destroy the HIV virus.\nDr p, O. Oyekan, the NSA's\nsecretary-general, told a workshop\nin Thadan last year that the\nsoybean contains properties capable\nof destroying the Aids causing\nvirus \"and as well prevent\ncancer and coronary\nailments.\"\nThe NSA man told participants\nat the workshop that the\nsoybean legume was the largest\nsingle source of vegetable oil in\nthe market worldwide. The soybean\nwas cholesterol-free and capable of preventing deadly\ndiseases.\nOil from the soybean contains\n40 per cent protein which is higher\nthan that in ordinary beans,\nmeat, poultry eggs, dairy milk\nand cowpeas.\nAnd on Tuesday last week, Dr\nKatoh told the Nation that the\nclaim about the soybean and Aids\nwas founded on. a preliminary discovery made by Prof T Okubo of the Tahokn University\nin Sondai Japan.\nDr Ka h says that the Japanese\nscientist discovered Aids suppressing ingredients in the\nsoybean. 'The report was first\nsubmitted at an international\nmeeting' Beijing, China, 'in\n1990.\"\nThe protein-rich soybean\n(commonly called soyabean)\nmight be possible cure and preventive\nmeasure for the Aids virus,\nhe said . \"But that is a matter\nto be ratified or dismissed by the\ninternational medical\ncommunity.\"\nDr Katoh's mission in Kenya is\nnot to pronounce the soybean's\nAids curative and preventive\nvalue. He is out to populariae the\noil-seed legume as an alternative\nand riche source of vegetable oil\nand proteins.\nHe was on his way from Tanzania\nwhere he represented his\ncountry a the three-day Africa's\nAgriculture Development in the\n1990s conference.\nThe meeting, which was held in\nArusha between May 15 and 17,\nwas organised by the Sasakawa\nAfrican association and former\nUS President Jimmy Carter's\nGlobal 2 .\nAt the conference, Dr Katoh\npresented a paper titled \"The\nRole of soybean in sustainable Agriculture in Africa\u201d  It dwelt on the history and future prospects\nof soybean cultivation and consumption\nin Africa.\nIn a brief interview with the\nNation on arrival from Arusha,\nDr Katoh acknowledged that the\nsoybean grain was still not popular\nin Kenya.\nHe was appointed by the UN\nFood and Agricultural\nOrganisation (FAO) in 1987 as\nthe first biotechnology officer in\nthe organisation's Food and Agricultural\nIndustries Services (Agriculture\nDepartment).\nDr Katoh's mission was to\nidentify pressing needs for biotechnology\napplications in the Third World with one of the priority issues being protein and calories\nin Africa.\nHe said that the FAO mission\nat the International Institute of\nTropical Agriculture (UTA) in\nIbadan, Nigeria, organised a\nmeeting in September 1987 to\ndiscuss strategi4!S and formulate\npolicies for legume utilisation, development\nand extension.\nThe 35 experts at the meeting\nwere drawn from the agriculture,\nresearch, government, universities\nand industrial sectors.\nAmong the conclusions made at the meeting was the need to\nincorporate the recipe for soybean\nwith the traditional and\nprevailing dietary habits of rural\nAfrica..\nIt was found that recipe development\nwas absolutely necessary\nif the soybean was to supplement\nand substitute traditional foods\nlike cowpea which have a lower\nprotein and calorie content.\nDr Katoh says that though\nKenya has a proven potential for\nsoybean which is a native of China,\nskills of cooking it are still\nlacking. Recently, Dr Katoh met the director\nof the Kenya Agricultural\nResearch Institute (Karl), Dr Cyrus\nNdiritu, who informed him\nthat the crop had been doing well\nalbeit at a small-scale in Kenya.\n\"The director will propose the\ndate for a Kenya-Japan meeting\non soybean where he will present\na project proposal\", Dr Katoh,\nsays.\nDuring the Arusha meeting,\nthe Nigerian delegation proposed\na $1 million soybean project to\nthe government of Japan.\nThe money, says Dr Katoh,\nwill go towards developing a soybean\nextension centre in Nigeria\nwhere the crop was first introduced in 1906.\nIn the paper he presented in\nArusha, Dr Katoh argues that\nwithout the soybean legume, \"it\nwould not be possible to sustain\nthe lives of five billion people\" in\nthe world.\nAt present, he says, the protein\nsupply of the world, including the\nprotein sources for animal feed,\ngreatly depends on the 130 million\ntones of soybean production\nin the US, Brazil, Argentina.\nand China.\nAnd in Africa, soybean could\nhelp stop the critical population nutrition gap in the coming\ncentury.\nQuoting figures published in\nthe FAO publication Oil World,\nDr Katoh shows that Africa and\nEurope are yet to take the production\nof soybean seriously.\nOut of the 126,560,000 tonnes\nproduced in the world in the\n1990/91 period, only a meagre\n476,000 tonnes came from Africa\nand 2,715,000 from European\ncountries.\nUSA had the highest production\nwith 52,303,000 tonnes during\nthat period followed by Brazil\nwith 20,100,000.\nDr Katoh foresees Kenya\nspearheading the introduction of\nlarge-scale soybean production in\nEast Africa for domestic consumption\nand export. Already, he\nhas been assured of technical\nsupport by the Kari director,\nNdiritu.\nThe price of traditional sources\nof proteins such as meat is\nunaffordable to the ordinary\nmwananchi while poultry eggs,\nwhose protein content is higher\nthan that of beef, are undesirable\ndue to their high cholestrol\ncontent.\nThus, it might be worthwhile\nto encourage the cultivation and\nconsumption of the soybean as\nan alternative and more nutritious\nsource of proteins and vegetable\noil. \n\nDr Katoh: \"Matter to be ratified\nor dismissed\"."}
