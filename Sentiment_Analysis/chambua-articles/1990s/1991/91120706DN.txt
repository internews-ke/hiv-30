{"text": "Friday, December 6 1991\n\nPopulous India looks set to be Asian Aids capital.\n\nMedical experts believe India is\ngoing the way of Africa in the\nspread of Aids and that the virus\ncould reach epidemic proportions\nbefore the end of the century.\nUntil recently Aids was seen as\na problem affecting only a microscopic\nminority of Indians but\nnow the country is estimated to\naccount for one-tenth of the\nworld's Aids carriers.\nIf statistical estimates are true,\nIndia could be the epicenter of\nthe Aids epidemic in Asia.\n\"There is no room for complacency as far as the Aids situation in the country is concerned,\" said India's Minister for Health R.L.\nMishra.\nA recent World Health\nOrganization (WHO) projection\nfound that Indians constitute an\nincreasingly larger share of Aids\npatients and soon will be a close\nsecond to the whole of Africa.\nWhile India's Health and Family\nWelfare Ministry computes\nthat the total HIV-positive population\nin India is 15,000 people,\nthe WHO puts it at 250,000.\nThe WHO warned that by 1995\nevery third mother-to-be in the\nwestern port city of Bombay is\nlikely to harbour the Aids virus.\nIf current trends continue, by\n1996 the city is expected to have\n2.25 million HIV-positive cases\namong its population of more\nthan 8 million.\nIt has an estimated 100,000\nprostitutes who entertain an average\n10 customers a day. A quarter\nof the men in the city visit prostitutes regularly.\nA study by the Indian Council\nof Medical Research (ICMR) and\nthe IRA (Indian Health Association)\nfound that 20 per cent of\nBombay,' prostitutes were HIV\npositive in 1990~\n\"The steep curve in Bombay of\nHIV positive cases is even steeper\nthan in Africa,\" said Dr N.R.\nShah, Director of Disease Prevention\nin the WHO regional office\nin India.\nPrakash Mahan, Health Secretary\nof Maharashtra state. whose\ncapital is Bombay, said: \"The\nAids problem exists in the smaller\ntowns as well.\"\nA.M. Mehta, Maharashtra Assistant\nDirector of Health Services,\nsaid: \"It is likely that the\nAids virus has spread into the remote\nhamlets and small towns of\nthe state as many outsiders visiting\nBombay frequent prostitutes.\n\"Similarly, truck drivers moving\ninto the state have sexual\ncontact with the villagers.\"\nThough strict states regulations\ngovern blood transfusions\nin Maharashtra, health officials\nadmit that about 30-40 per cent\nof the blood supply comes from\nsmall clinics not controlled by the\nhealth department.\nDr A.S. Paintal, who recently\nretired as Director-General of ICMR, points out that in a city\nlike Bombay where the mobility\nof people in the sexually active\nage groups is among the highest\nin India, the spread of the disease\nis likely to swamp conservative\nestimates.\nIndia has the largest number of\nSexually Transmitted Disease\n(STD) cases and accounts for one\nin four of all STD victims worldwide,\nand is a fertile ground for\nthe spread of Aids.\n\"One of the common factors\nbetween Africa and India is a\nvery high prevalence of STD\nwhich makes a woman more vulnerable\nto Aids,\" said a WHO\nofficial.\nThe organization says Aids\ncould assume epidemic form in\nIndia because of financial, manpower\nand logistics constraints,\nand could form a serial disaster\nwhen combined with poverty,\nmalnutrition and insanitary\nconditions.\nA majority of Indian sufferers\nget Aids through contaminated\nblood and drug abuse as well as\nsexually promiscuous behaviour.\nA random survey by the Director-\nGeneral of. Health Services\nshowed that of 1,795 women\nfound to have Aids, 1,631 contracted\nit through \"heterosexual encouraging If promiscuous\" behaviour. Of\nthe 3.188 Indian men tested\nseropositive, 1,150 were found to\ncontract the Aids virus through\ninfected needles and unchecked\ndrug abuse.\nDr Helga. Rubsamen\nWaigmann, a researcher at the\nWashington-based National Cancer\nResearch Institute, accidentally\ndiscovered a highly deadly\nHIV-2 virus previously thought\nto be found only in West Africa.\nData on the extent and spread\nof Aids in India are both scanty\nand superficial and there is little\npublic realization about how the\nvirus is spreading into the general\npopulation.\nAccording to sociologist Dr.Prakesh Kothari, Aids is rampant\nin India but is being hidden.\nHe believes that unless preventive\nmeasures are taken \"on a\nwar footing,\" the virus will have..\ndisastrous effect on the count~\nsocial, cultural and economic life.\nThe Government has approached\nthe World Bank for a\n$70 million project loan to accelerate\nan Aids control programme.\nIn the tribal-dominated northeastern\nregion bordering Burma,\nAids has made deep inroads,\nboosted by the intravenous use of\nthe huge quantity of illicit drugs\nfrom Burma that find their way\nto Manipur, Nagaland and\nMizoram.\nIn Manipur alone, one survey\nfound more than 3,000 cases of\nAids am among users.\n(Compass News Features)"}
