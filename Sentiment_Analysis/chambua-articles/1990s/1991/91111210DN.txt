{"text": "Africa's recovery hopes grow slim\nLeaders stay to long\nBy AIDAN HARTLEY, MONDAY\nAfrica is shedding the dictators\nand corrupt one-party systems of\nits \"lost decades' - but can democracy\nreally save the world's\npoorest continent from chaos and\ncollapse in the 1990s\n\"Africa hasn't that many\nchances left,\" said one Nairobi based\ndiplomat. \"After decades of\nrulers who made their countries\nvictim to crack-pot theories or,\nworse still, plundered them,\nthings have got to get better.\"\nThe plight of Africa's 650 million\npeople is underlined by the\nstark fact that they are poorer\ntoday than they were 30 years\nago.\nIn a desperate attempt to find\na system of politics that will stave\nof disintegration, most of sub-Saharan\nAfrica's 47 states are moving\ntowards pluralism or multiparty\ndemocracy.\nSome, ravaged by war and ethnic\nrivalries, may not make it.\n\"Africa may polarise into two\ngroups: Those. that can establish\nbetter economic management\nwith stable multi-party democracies\nor benigh despots and those\nthat fall apart,\" said Mr Michael\nHodd, an economist at London's\nSchool of Oriental and African\nStudies. He said some countries could\nfollow the path of Mauritius and\nBotswana, both multi-party\nstates, which were among the\nfastest growing economies m the\nworld during the 1980s.\nBut many economists fear it is\ntoo late to save a number of\ncountries damaged by elderly rulers\nwho stayed too long.\n\"When the tyrant goes, the repairing\nperiod is extremely long,\"\nsaid Mr Hodd, citing Uganda\nwhich has struggled to recover\nsince Idi Amin was overthrown in\n1979.\nDictatorship and war have\nruined Ethiopia, Liberia, Mozambique,\nSomalia, Sudan and\nZaire.\n\"Liberia and Somalia have effectively\nceased to exist as modem\nnation states,\" said Professor\nI. M. Lewis, a Somalia expert at\nBritain's London School of Economics.\n\"Others may go the same\nway.\"\nZambian President Kenneth\nKaunda was defeated in multiparty\nelections last month. His\nlegacy: A virtually bankrupt\neconomy ..\nSome 30 African countries\nhave embarked on foreign aid\nbacked economic reforms since\nthe 198Os Started by one-party governments\nto remedy decades of misrule,\nthe austerity measures will\n.prove a troublesome inheritance\nfor the new democracies, economists\nsay.\n\"Expectations are high after\nthings have gone so bad, and this\ngood governance may not be able\nto deliver overnight,' said Odume Teribe, planning director of the\nUN Economic Commission for\nAfrica.\nPluralism will not be enough to\nrevive economies if foreign donors\nthat jostled to give aid during\nthe cold war lose interest after\npressuring governments to\ndemocratise, he said.\n\"Even when they (African countries) have good governance\naid may still be token, he added.\nThe World Bank 1991 annual\nreport lists Africa's woes: 160 billion\ndollars of debt, 30 million\npeople facing starvation this year\ndue to drought and war, declining\nGDP growth in 1990 and a slump\nin prices for key' commodities\nsuch as coffee, tea and cocoa.\nUN Secretary-General Perez\nde Cuellar recently warned of a\ncrisis of \"tragic proportions\" if\nforeign aid of up to 30 billion dollars\na year was not obtained for\nall of Africa to double per capita\nincome to 700 dollars by 2015.\nAfrica's population is expected\nto climb three per cent a year to\n900 million by the year 2000 at\npresent rates, swallowing any\neconomic gains and raising the\npressures of urbanisation and\nunemployment.\nThe killer disease Aids will\ncause African life expectancy to\ndecline by the year 2000. The Hiv \nvirus already affects six million\nAfricans ,out of a World Health\nOrganisation estimated total of\n9-11 million.\nMany look to a future multiracial\nSouth Africa as an engine\nof growth for the region, but political\nunrest there may mean it\ncannot deliver. \n\f\ndespite the gloom, international economist note the emergence of a new realism among African planners that should lead to accountability\nand more of a self-help attitude.\nIt's not lack of money. that's problem. Management is really the key,\" said Jonathan\nFrimpong-Ansah, director of the\nUN-backed African capacity initiative in Harare ..\n'Until Africa begins to \nemphasise that and gets away\nfrom complaining about it\nthe world economy we will get\nnowhere.\nwithout promising any quick\nfixes democratic governments\nare more likely to improve the\nclimate for private investment. after\nthe corruption and instability\ntheir forebare.\"\nWe have embarked on highly\nunproductive projects and military\nbudgets far beyond our resources\n.... the net effect is our current\ndebt problem,\" said\nGeorge Mbowe, Director General\nKampala-based East Africa\nDevelopment Bank ..\nAfrica should learn to spend\nwithin its means and in that way\nwe should be able to release a lot\nof funds for investment.\"\n(Reuters)\nMr Kaunda: Left Zambia virtually\nBankrupt\nEx-dictator Amin: Repairs still in\nprogress"}
