{"text": "Aids: The picture stays frightening\nThe pathetic story carried elsewhere in this newspaper on the ravages that Aids has brought to Ugandan villages will very soon be told about Kenya if the current lax attitude most people have about the fatal virus is carried into the future. The devastation of Kyebe is a heart-stopping tragedy that screams at Kenyans to focus fresh attention on\nthe Aids scourge.\nDuring the recent World Aids Day - and periodically over the years - the message has been that local Aids cases were rising. Lately, figures have been going up geometrically. This year, we heard that more than 19,000 people have either developed Aids or died from it since 1985 and it is estimated that between 200,000 and 300,000 active and seemingly healthy Kenyans are carriers of the Aids-causing virus. It is this and the fact that the virus spreads quickly and quietly to kill victims three, four or even 10 years later, which is worrying.\nIt means that we shall wake up one morning to find that millions have \"quietly\" perished leaving behind a heritage of pain, poverty, large numbers of orphans, huge medical debts, and diseases such as tuberculosis and cancer.\nIt need not be gainsaid, therefore, that there is a strong and urgent need for Kenyans to introduce more vigorous strategies to curb the spread of this disease. Indeed, it, should be recognised that in Africa, especially most of sub.\nSaharan Africa, there is already a \"high risk environment\".\nWe agree with the message from the World Health\nOrganisation's regional office that Aids poses a special and\n'major problem for the continent where illiteracy runs high.\nPeople must be told repeatedly that there is still no cure\nfor Aids. There are a number of vaccines and drugs being\ntried, but there is still no proven cure and those infected\nwith the HIV virus will definitely die.\nIt is true that Kenyans may be having two interferon based\ndrugs, Kemron and Immunex, but they are not cures\ndespite having the quality of \"easing\" some opportunistic\ninfections in some Aids patients.\n- Prevention remains the only hope to check the spread of\nAids, a disease which can wipe out families and\ncommunities. Kenya has very effective radio programmes\nalso translated in various local languages to educate people\nand help them prevent the spread of the disease.\nHowever, there are still people who choose not be believe\nthat the new disease kills. Their blind drive or desire for sex\nhas 'not ebbed and they therefore still have sex with\nmultiple partners.\nKenyans just must stick to their faithful sex partners.\nThe penalty for engaging in sexual intercourse with a\nmultiplicity of partners is a death sentence. Indeed, Kenya\nis even lucky to have the Know Aids Society which is doing\nits best to enlighten people on the dangers posed by Aids.\nThe society, founded by people like Mr Joe Muriuki, who\nwas the first Kenyan to tell the world that he was an Aids\ncarrier, should be given more resources to help combat\nAids. Our National Aids Committee, religious organisations\nand all concerned should constantly remind Kenyans that\nthey should avoid this lethal infection by sticking to single\nsex partners.\nThe religious organisations can particularly crusade\nagainst customs and habits or traditions that may expose\npeople to the disease.\nFinally, the s4ccess of the Aids control programme will\ndepend on how we treat those infected with the HIV virus.\nTheir active participation in the control of Aids is crucial\nand the experiences they have undergone, especially being\ndiscriminated against, should be part and parcel of the\nlessons to be imparted to Kenyans in the campaign against\nAids.\n, This craven and escapist way of looking at Aids as a\n' problem affecting \"others\" must 'be fought on all fronts, any\ntime and all the time. \"The truth is that Aids is already\nthreatening everybody and that it KILLS\nINDISCRIMINATELY.\nSome nations which assumed a few years that Aids was a\ndisease for the immoral society in the West and Africa are\nnow faced with a serious Aids problem. Attempts at\nconcealing our Aids problem in order to attract tourists and\ninvestors are immoral in the extreme; they are ugly and\nobviously myopic because, in most cases, Aids' reached\nAfrica via international tourism.\nKenya, like other African nations, has to import the\ntechnology needed to screen blood transfusion for the\npresence of the Aids-causing virus. The country should also\nimport more drugs to treat opportunistic infections and\nother complications.\nOur message is this: Aids is ,100 per cent fatal. In the\nabsence of a cure, the only way to prevent its spread is for'\nevery Kenyan to religiously guard against indiscriminate\nsex. It is a question of behavioural change."}
