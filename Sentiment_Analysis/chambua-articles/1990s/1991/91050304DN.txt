{"text": "Kemron tablets on the way from Japan\nBy JOSEPH OLWENY\nThe Director of Medical Services,\nProfessor Oliech, said yesterday\nthat the country would\nsoon receive 700,000 Kemron\ntablets from Japan and that the Ministry of Health will erect a concrete fence around the New\nNyanza District Hospital to curb\ntheft of drugs.\nTalking to the Press in his\nAfya House office, Prof Oliech said the new Kemron consignment was intended for the second phase of research into the drug's efficacy.\nHe said the Ministry was also contemplating the use of Kemron in powder form because it powder\ndisolves faster in the mouth than tablets.\nThe drug's efficacy was encouraging,\nhe said, and the expected consignment would further the continuing research. Up to\n200,000 people are feared to have\ncontracted the disease in Kenya\nalthough only about 9,000 had\nbeen diagnosed HIV -positive.\nDr Oliech said that barbers\nshould sterilise their equipment\nso they do not transmit the Aids\nvirus to their clients. Kemron, he\nsaid, had been unable to act positively\nin some patients.\nHe said the Ministry of Health\nwould soon start admitting young\ntradional circumcisers and tooth\nextractors for a six-month training\ncourse on how to sterilise\ntheir equipment.\nRegarding the Nyanza Hospital\nfence, Prof Oliech said drugs\nand other equipment were disappearing\nbecause the hospital had\nno perimeter fence to check the\nflow of people in and out of its premises.\n\"The New Nyanza General\nHospital used to have a fence but\nit was brought down. Now there\nis no fence and the theft of drugs\nand equipment has increased,\" he\nsaid.\nThe hopital's administration,\nhe said, had been advised by the\nMinistry to look into ways\nthrough which the institution\ncould erect a concrete wall so that\nthe flow of people could be\nchecked.\nThe Ministry of Health deplored\ndrug thefts, Dr Oliech said\nand warned that any officer in\nthe Ministry found stealing drugs\nwould be prosecuted .\nThe administration and the\npolice had been asked by the\nMinistry to assist by investigating\nincidents of thefts of drugs\nand other hospital equipment."}
