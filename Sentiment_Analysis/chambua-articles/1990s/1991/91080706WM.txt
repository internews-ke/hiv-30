{"text": "Care at\nbirth' can\ncurb Aids\nBy OTULA OWUOR\nMedical researchers estimate\nthat between 30 to 50 per cent of\nchildren born to mother's with\nthe Human Immune Deficiency\nvirus HIV) causing AIDS end up\nwith the lethal infection.\nHowever, the trend may 'be\ncurbed if methods of delivery are\nimproved. The July 27 issue of\nLancet, a weekly British medical\njournal, says that biomedical researchers\nhave evidence that\n\"there is no consistent spread of\nHIV across the placenta. during\nmaternal viraemia - virus in the\nblood - and in most case:., transmission\noccurs close to or at delivery\".\nThus, doctors need to\ntake extra precautions when delivering\nbabies whose mothers are\nHIV-positive.\nHowever, this finding by Swedish\nresearchers tends to differ\nfrom a study done in Zaire, which\nhad indicated that the virus was\nbeing transmitted across the placenta\nbecause the virus were\nisolated from the umbilical cord.\nThe reseachers allege that this\nmay have been a different strain\nof HIV.\n\\ Obviously, there is still a major.\nneed to clearly identify the factors\nassociated with HW transmission\nfrom the mother to the\nchild."}
