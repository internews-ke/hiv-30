{"text": "US girl dies of Aids\nMIAMI, Sunday\nKimberly Bergalis, who contracted Aids from a dentist in the first known incident of doctor-to-patient infection, died today.\nA statement released early today by Miss Bergalis' attorney, Mr Robert Montgomery, did not\nsay where she died. She was 23. \"Today, a gallant young women lost her life needlessly,\" Mr Montgomery said in his statement.\n\"The death of Kimberly Bergalis is a testimony to the disgraceful practice of health care professionals who put their patients lives in jeopardy by continuing to perform invasive procedures even though they are infected with life-threatening contagious diseases such as Aids and Hepatitis B,\" the statement said.\nMiss Bergalis shocked the world in September 1990 when\nshe came forward and said she was \"Patient A,\" the first known case of a patient who contracted Aids during a medical procedure.\nDoctors rejected the idea at first. But her claims that she had avoided risky behaviour checked out. In January 1991, the US Centres for Disease Control determined that her particular strain of HIV almost identically matched her dentist's.\n\"This girl went through a tremendous amount of public indignity. She could have sat home and just quietly died,\" her father, George Berltalis, said in an earlier\ninterview. (AP)"}
