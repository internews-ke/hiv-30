{"text": "SUNDAY NATION, DECEMBER I, 1991 13\n\nWorld Bank Warns of\n'threat to progress\nBy EBO QUANSAH, SUNDAY\nNATION Correspondent, London\nThe World Bank has warned in a\nmessage to mark today's world\nAids Day that the disease threatens\nto reverse development in\nAfrica and the Third World.\nAccording to World Bank\nNews, most of the 10 million\npeople world-wide. currently infected\nby the HIV virus live in\nAfrica, Latin America and the\nCaribbean. By the year\u00b7\u00b7 2000,\nmore than 30 million people\nworld-wide would have been\nstruck down, with 90 per cent in\nAfrica and the rest of ,the developing\nworld.\nEconomist Jill Armstrong, of\nthe Bank's Eastern African Department\nin Nairobi, said the\nhigh incidence of Aids and HIV\ninfection could have a profound\nimpact on the development of\ncountries that are already facing\ncrises, such as famine, civil war\nand debt.\n\"To date, most of the discussion\nsurrounding the Aids epidemic\nhas focused on the devastating\nhuman toll and the serious\nconstraints that will be placed on\nnational health care systems,\"\nsays Ms Armstrong.\nBut today, the epidemic\n\"threatens to alter dramatically the economic and social fabric of\nmany societies, raising serious\nquestions about the development\nprocess itself,\" she warned.\nShe said in some African countries,\nwhere one in 10 adults may\nbe infected with HIV, Aids related\ndeaths among both adults and\nchildren are already wiping out\nprogress in reducing mortality\nrates.\nNo part of a country's economy\nis safe from Aids, the World\nBank official said. In the agricultural\nsector, for instance, productivity\nmay drop off due to Aids\nincreases.\n\"For countries where the bulk\nof agricultural production is very\nlabour-intensive, shortages of\nable-bodied adults, may lower\noverall agricultural output\".\nShe said by the year 2000, as\nmany as 10 million children may.\nbe orphaned in Africa because\nAids would have killed both or\none parent .\nMs Armstrong warns that African\ncountries would not be able\nto cope with the problem.\n\"Orphanage holds little hope as\na solution because of the sheer\nnumbers involved. The extended\nfamilies in parts of Africa are already\nbeginning to feel the\nstrain. \""}
