NGOs to administer
Standard Two test to
gauge learners’ level
of understanding

By JOY WANJA
Can you pass a basic Standard
Two test? You may be schooled
but you are not educated!
Picture this. A woman’s baby is
dying of a disease and a nearby poster on
the wall gives details on how to prevent or
cure it, yet she cannot interpret it despite
having attended primaty schooL
This is part of a dilemma that a group of
education researchers are out to establish;
whether Kenya’s citizens can read but can
not process information correctly
Education researchers have designed a
unique test aimed at reviewing Kenyans’
ability to read and write cornpetentlv despite
going through a rigorous school system.
Be shocked
“You would be shocked to learn a Standard
Seven pupil cannot do simple calculations
or read a paragraph.” Uwezo-Kenya’s coun
try director, Dr Sarah Ruto, told the Daily
!Vation yesterday during the training of
volunteers to spearhead the exercise.
The study seeks to establish whether
learners merely attend school as a ritual
or to acquire skills in reading, writing, lis
tening and speaking.
So do car accidents occur because mo
torists cannot interpret road signs, and

one’s level of illiteracy or ignorance?
Uwezo-Kenya has noted that though
nìost learners attend school, their in
ability to recognise basic language skills
is alarming.
Dr Ruto said the education census will
give a basic test that will require learners
to read out letters of the alphabet, words,
sentences and paragraphs and later an

According to sample questions seen by
the Nation, the learners will be gauged
according to levels of difficulty of the sen
tences they can read.
Simple arithmetic and sentences like
‘Our class went to the zoo: and ‘Uwanja
urnejaa watu’ are examples of sentences
in the questionnaires.
The 100-day study will involve school
visits and household counts to evaluate
the level of reading and writing of learn-

Dr Ruto said the exercise aims at pro
viding information on the importance of
learners acquiring basic reading and writ
ing skills in order to succeed.
‘We will administer a basic Standard Two
test to everyone at the letter, word, sentence
and paragraph level to evaluate how much
they can understand,” said Dr Ruto.
flasic tests in English, Mathematies and
Kiswahili will be administered to pupils
in over 72 districts and the results an
nounced in January next year.
Prof Daniel Sifuna, a lecturer at Kenyat
ta Universit,; is worried that the quality of
education in the country does not match
current development trends.
We focus on the colonial curriculum
instead of upgrading to the present soci
etal needs.” he said.
According to the education expert, the
quality education has been pegged to
passing national examinations which he
described as a ‘worrying trend:
Prof Sifuna warned that the focus on ex
amination results in developing countries
that encourages rote learning can be risky
to a pupil’s quality of learning.
“Kenyans have neglected books, we
need to foster a reading culture,” he said.
The thorough school system is currently
under keen study to ascertain whether pu
pils can relate what is learnt in school to
what happens in the society
In Kenya, learners’ abilities are deter
mined through grades in their respective
classes and by terminal national exami
nations.

km. Jeffries Charles cites an example of
an illiterate farmer who cannot interpret
simple instructions which could save his
crops from a disaster.
Numerical skills
The national exercise targeting 72 dis
tricts hopes to establish the learners’ nu
merical skills and the ability to interpret
information.
Though literacy is a fundamental
human right, the education experts were
concerned about its lack of impact in the
learners’ decision making.

The Kenya National Examination coun

provide an opportunity to review the cur

The assessment would help in formulat
ing policies that would improve learning
in schools countrywide, Knec boss Paul

Utnth and Tanzania will carry out
a similar three-month study to evaluate
whether the problem is in the education
system or with the learners themselves
