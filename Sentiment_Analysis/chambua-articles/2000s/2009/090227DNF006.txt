{"text": "\ufeffFriday February 27, 2009\r\n\r\nSaliva-based HIV test\r\nset to be introduced\r\n\r\nBy GATONYE GATHURA\r\nA new HIV/Aids testing kit\r\nusing saliva instead of blood\r\nwill soon be introduced in\r\npublic health centres.\r\nIt will involve collecting saliva\r\nsamples instead of blood\r\nsamples and it will take 20\r\nminutes for the results to be\r\nknown.\r\n\u201cWe are sorting out some technical\r\ndetails and hope to roll\r\nout a national campaign within\r\nsix months from now,\u201d said\r\nDr Nicholas Muraguri, a director\r\nwith the National Aids/STD\r\nControl Programme.\r\nThe new development, he\r\nsaid, is one of several strategies\r\nNascop is using to reach\r\nUN targets for universal HIV\r\nknowledge status.\r\nNew technology\r\n\u201cCurrently only about 35 per\r\ncent of adult Kenyans know\r\ntheir HIV status. We plan to\r\nraise this to 80 per cent by\r\nnext year.\u201d\r\nSaliva-based test is a relatively\r\nnew technology, but one\r\nwhich is already in use in most\r\ndeveloped countries. In the\r\ncontinent, it is being applied\r\nin South Africa, Ghana, and\r\nMauritius.\r\n\u201cInitially we plan to use the\r\ntechnology alongside existing\r\nones, a factor that could\r\nfurther improve on accuracy,\r\nspeed and safety,\u201d said Dr Muraguri.\r\nThe test, made by Calypte\r\nBiomedical Corporation of the\r\nUS, provides results within 20\r\nminutes with 99 per cent accuracy.\r\nPrevious rapid HIV tests\r\nrequire blood samples.\r\nWhere used, research indicates\r\nit has proved cheaper and\r\nreduces the risk of accidental\r\nHIV transmission to health\r\npersonnel.\r\nThe new test involves wiping\r\na swab along the gums\r\nand placing it into a liquid in\r\nthe testing device. When antibodies\r\nto the HIV virus are\r\ndetected, there will be a colour\r\nchange on the device.\r\nAlthough it is only available\r\nat approved hospitals\r\nand major clinics, as happens\r\nelsewhere, it will eventually be\r\navailable in commercial pharmacies.\r\n\u201cBut we have to consider\r\nhow patients might react to\r\nthe results at home, without\r\nhealth-care workers on hand\r\nto counsel them, and what to\r\ndo for confirmation in case\r\nthey get false results,\u201d said the\r\ndirector. The low viral concentration\r\nin saliva explains why it\r\ncan be used to detect HIV, but\r\nis not an agent for transmitting\r\nthe virus.\r\nThe test provides\r\nresults within 20\r\nminutes with 99\r\nper cent accuracy"}
