He\r\nis sickly and always out of\r\nschool due to this or that\r\nillness. His parents are HIV\r\npositive. But my worry\r\nis that I shared a spoon\r\nwith him. My friends later\r\nstarted telling me that I\r\ngot infected with the virus.\r\nIt\u2019s really got into my head\r\nand now I am very worried\r\nand stressed. Please help.\r\nDick,\r\nNairobi\r\nDear Dick,\r\nYour have raised a\r\nsensitive and important\r\nissue. First, it\u2019s got to do\r\nwith an understanding,\r\nor lack of it, regarding\r\nhow the AIDS virus\r\nis transmitted. This is\r\nwhat fuels your fear of\r\ncontracting Aids because\r\nyou shared a spoon with\r\nsomeone who is suspected\r\nto have the virus. Second,\r\nis the stigmatisation that\r\nface people believed to\r\nbe living with AIDS. It is\r\nbad enough for an adult\r\nto face stigma but worse\r\nfor a child. This is why\r\nyou need to show your\r\nschoolmate love and not\r\nrun away from him, if\r\nindeed he is HIV positive.\r\nBut remember these are\r\njust rumours. Unless he has\r\nbeen tested and found to\r\nbe HIV positive, it is wrong\r\nto spread such a rumour.\r\nIt is wrong to assume he is\r\nHIV positive, just because\r\nhis parents are.\r\nTo address your\r\nproblem, you need to\r\nknow the facts about\r\ntransmission of HIV, which\r\nmany young people of\r\nyour age may be unaware\r\nof. It\u2019s highly unlikely that\r\nyou can contract Aids by\r\nsharing a spoon. HIV is\r\nalso not transmitted by\r\nsharing a classroom desk,\r\nthrough insect bite, casual\r\ncontact or by sharing food.\r\nThere is no risk of catching\r\nthe HIV virus by talking,\r\neating, drinking, sharing\r\ntoilets and towel with\r\npeople living with AIDS.\r\nHIV is transmitted in three\r\nways:\r\nThrough unprotected\r\nsex with an infected man\r\nor woman.\r\nBy infected blood\r\nentering the blood stream\r\nthrough sharing injection\r\nneedles, transfusion of\r\ninfected blood or blood\r\nproducts and through\r\nneedle injuries, etc.\r\nFrom a woman with HIV\r\nto her baby either during\r\npregnancy, or during\r\ndelivery.\r\nThere is no evidence\r\nto show that one can\r\ncontract HIV through\r\nsocial contact. Hugging\r\nand touching as well as\r\nbeing close to infected\r\npeople pose no risk of\r\ninfection. So you should\r\nsocialise freely with your\r\nschoolmate whether he is\r\nHIV positive or not. You\r\nand your colleagues need\r\nto discard the myths about\r\nHIV/Aids and help break\r\nthe stigma immediately.\r\nIs it right\r\nto have a\r\ngirlfriend?\r\nDear Auntie Liz,\r\nI am 15 years old and I live\r\nin Nairobi. Many of my\r\nfriends have boyfriends\r\nand girlfriends. Most of\r\nthem spend all their free\r\ntime just hanging out\r\nwith their partners. A few\r\nweeks ago, a girl asked\r\nme out for a date but I did\r\nnot accept because I am\r\nnot sure if it is right for\r\nme to have a girlfriend at\r\nthis age. Please advise if I\r\nshould ask the girl out for\r\na date or not.\r\nJohn,\r\nNairobi\r\nDear John,\r\nThank you for sharing your\r\nconcerns with me. Some\r\nboys and girls may start\r\ndating early, while others\r\npostpone till much later,\r\neven in their 20s. While it\r\nis good to delay dating, a\r\nmajority of young people\r\nare simply unable to do it.\r\nWhen you delay dating, it\r\nhelps you to focus entirely\r\non appropriate activities\r\nthat will build skills you will\r\nneed as a teen and young\r\nadult. You will instead\r\nspend more time playing\r\nand having fun with samesex\r\nfriends.\r\nThese friendships help\r\nyouth learn many skills\r\nabout getting along with\r\nothers. So it gets easier\r\nwhen eventually you start\r\ndating. Boys and girls who\r\nstart dating early probably\r\nwon\u2019t learn some of the\r\nskills that they will need to\r\nhave healthy relationships\r\nlater on. When you delay\r\ndating, it also means you\r\nreduce chances of being\r\ninvolved in early sexual\r\nactivity which may lead\r\nto pregnancy and expose\r\nyou to sexually transmitted\r\ndiseases like HIV/AIDS.\r\nI understand why you\r\nare hesitant to take on a\r\ngirlfriend. Do not let her\r\npush this idea into you if you are not\r\nready. One reason that may push you\r\ninto early dating is peer pressure.\r\nSpecialists say young people need\r\na sense of personal identity before\r\nthey can be really close to another\r\nperson. In other words, if a young\r\nperson does not know who he or\r\nshe really is, what he or she likes and\r\ndislikes, and what his or her values\r\nare, that boy or girl cannot have a\r\nhealthy relationship with a person of\r\nthe opposite sex. So there is nothing\r\nwrong with having a girlfriend so\r\nlong as you know your limits.\r\nEmail your questions\r\nto yn@nation.co.ke or\r\negitonga@nation.co.ke\r\nOr send to Auntie Liz, Young\r\nNation, Box 49010, 00100,\r\nNairobi"}
