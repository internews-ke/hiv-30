The coalition\r\nbrings together five homosexual groups\r\nMr Kuria is also concerned that if pro-\r\ngrammes to fight Aids are not extended to\r\ngays, then, \u201cthe war against Aids in Kenya\r\nmay be difficult to win\u2019\r\nIn some places the virus is circulating\r\nkst among married men in gay relation\r\nships. \u2018They either bring the virus with\r\nthem into their network and circulate\r\nit, or carry it from their network to their\r\nspouses and gMfriends\u201d Mr Kuria said.\r\nUnlike Europe\r\nUnlike Europe and America where there\r\nis a difference in the type of 11W virus\r\namong homosexuals and heterosexual, in\r\nKenya, the same type is spreading among\r\nboth. This means that there is a lot of\r\ninter-phase between the two, he added.\r\nHe cites a number of factors respon\r\nsible, among them, lack of Aids pro\r\ngrammes in Kenya that target sexual\r\nminorities. \u201cWithout information, our\r\npeople imagine they are not vulnerable\r\nto HW They have not seen anything that\r\ntefis them they are at risk,\u201d he explained.\r\nThis ignorance among most gays and\r\nlesbians leads to unprotected sex\r\nMr Kurta says stigma and discrimina\r\ntion of homosexuals hinders them from\r\ngetting medical treatment. \u201cWhenever\r\ngays are infected, many delay going to\r\nhospital They resort to self-treatment,\r\nand only seek proper medical care when\r\nthe illness is at an advanced stage,\u201d he\r\nsaid. This he added, posed a big challenge\r\nin prevention and control of 11W virus.\r\nAlso, the chances of acquiring the virus\r\nare higher among individuals who are not\r\non ARVs. Discrimination, which prevents\r\nHW positive homosexuals from seeking\r\nhealthcare fuels the spread of the virus.\r\n\u201cIn Nairobi the infection rate among mar\r\nried men is high as they actively interact\r\namong their network,\u201d Mr Ku na tid.\r\nGALK, he said, was not interested in ad\r\nvancing the gay agenda or gay marriages\r\nas most people would think, \u201cbut to offer\r\nservices to the homosexual community,\r\n\u2018(;\u00c0LK not interested\r\nin advancing the\r\ngay agenda or gay\r\nmarriages as most\r\npeople would think\u2019\r\nsomething that cannot happen if it con\r\ntinues being criminalised.\r\n\u201cThe definition that marriage should be\r\nbetween a man and a woman is clear and\r\npositive, but the government shouldadd a\r\nclause that decriminalises homosexuality\r\nin Kenya:\u2019 Mr Kuria said and wants sec\r\ntions 162, 163 and 165 of the \u00a1nal Code\r\nrepealed. \u201cThese sections hinder us from\r\nproviding Aids healthcare and prevention\r\nservices and items \u2014 condoms and lubri\r\ncants \u2014 to the homosexual communit\u201d\r\nSafe networks\r\nFlashing a brochure, titled \u201cSafe sex for\r\nmen having sex with men\u201d, Mr Kuria says\r\nif he distributed it openly, he would be ar\r\nrested and charged with aiding another\r\nperson to commit a felon3 \u2018We only dis\r\ntribute suth information among \u201csafe net\r\nworks\u201d (homosexual groups).\r\nIf we can offer services unique to mem\r\nbers, then their Aids healthcare needs will\r\nbe met. But as long as the law stands, the\r\ncommunity will continue to die of Aids.\r\nHowever:\u2019 he added, \u201csome colleagues\r\nhave promised to influen\u0153 legislation\u201d\r\nAnother story on back page."}
