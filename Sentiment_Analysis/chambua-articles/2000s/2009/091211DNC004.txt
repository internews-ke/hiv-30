{"text": "\ufeffFriday December 11, 2009 DAILY NATION\r\n\r\nNew report unearths\r\nhigh levels of physical\r\nviolence against them\r\nby their partners\r\n\r\nBy KEN OPALA\r\nH aif of Kenyan women liv\r\ning with HIV/Aids have\r\nbeen physically abused in\r\nthe past year, accoMing to\r\na new study that highlights the wor\r\nrisome link between the scourge and\r\nviolence against women.\r\nAt least one in two of the victims\r\ninterviewed said they had been\r\nslapped or shoved, 40 per cent had\r\nbeen kicked or beaten, 36 per cent\r\nhad been hit with an object while 31\r\nper cent had been threatened by use\r\nof a knife or a weapon.\r\n\u201cThese results are indicative of\r\nhigh levels of physical violence\r\nagainst women by their partners ...\r\nthe consequence ranges from pain\r\nto death,\u201d says Linkages between\r\nViolence against Women and HW/\r\nAIDS among WOFAK Beneficiar\r\nies, a report prepared by Dr Mumbi\r\nMachem for Women Fighting Aids\r\nin Kenya (WOFAK) and ActionAid\r\nInternational Kenya, and which was\r\npublished this week.\r\nThe study was carried out in Nyan\r\nza, Coast, Western and Nairobi prov\r\ninoes.\r\n\u201cRape and sexual exploitation are\r\nprevalent in all the study areas. It\r\nis also evident that violence is com\r\nmon among adolescent girls. Aids or\r\nphans, especially young girls are at a\r\nhigher risk of forced marriage.\u201d\r\nGuardians force girls into mar\r\nnage to shove responsibility to the\r\nhusband. These girls risk mistreat\r\nment and other forms of violence,\r\nincluding rape. This increases their\r\nvulnerability to 111V infection, the\r\nreport indicates.\r\nPhysical abuse apart, the inci\r\ndence of psychological, economic\r\nand cultural trauma is much more\r\nworrying.\r\nSocial Isolation\r\nNearly nine in ten of women with\r\n111V face social isolation or have been\r\ndenied basic tights, such as food and\r\nmedical care. They also risk being\r\nevicted out of their homes or denied\r\nemployment.\r\n\u201cWe found that women who dis\r\nclose their 1-1W status face mistreat\r\nment by their husband\u2019s relatives.\r\nMost widows face the risk of being\r\ndisinherited by relatives. For women\r\nin rural areas like Bumala, cases of\r\nproperty tights abuse are common.\r\nWomen are often chased out of their\r\nmatrimonial homes as soon as the\r\nhusband dies\u2019\r\nHowever, the study further estab\r\nlished that the victims of violence\r\nare reluctant to talk about their ex\r\nperiences or even negotiate for better\r\nmedical attention."}
