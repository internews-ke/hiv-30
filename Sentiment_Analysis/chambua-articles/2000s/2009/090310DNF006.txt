{"text": "\ufeffTuesday March 10, 2009\r\n\r\nBefore sex Aids\r\npill trials to start\r\n\r\nBy GEOFFREY KAMADI\r\nA new study to determine whether\r\na single daily pill taken before\r\nsexual intercourse can prevent\r\nHIV infection will be launched\r\namong 700 virus-free women in Bondo\r\nDistrict, Nyanza within the next few\r\nmonths.\r\nThe clinical trial, which coincides with\r\nstudies in four other African countries as\r\nwell as the US, Thailand, Peru and Ecuador,\r\ncould strengthen a growing body of\r\nresearch aimed at stopping the transmission\r\nof HIV in so-called \u201cdiscordant couples\u201d\r\nwhere one partner does not have the\r\nvirus and the other one is infected.\r\nThe drug involved in the trial, Truvada,\r\nis already registered in Kenya and being\r\nused as an antiretroviral for people with\r\nHIV. Truvada prevents the virus from reproducing\r\nitself inside the cells of people\r\nalready infected. Researchers want to\r\ndiscover if it can prevent infection in an\r\nHIV-negative person who is at high risk\r\nof exposure to the virus, as is the case in\r\ndiscordant couples.\r\nThe Bondo study follows a similar initiative\r\nbeing conducted among 2,000 discordant\r\ncouples in Kisumu, Thika, Eldoret\r\nand Nairobi by the Universities of Nairobi\r\nand Washington in the US. According to\r\nthe Kenya Aids Indicator Survey 2007\r\nabout half of infected couples are discordant.\r\nAnimal studies\r\nAccording to Family Health International\r\n(FHI), a lead organisation in the proposed\r\ntrials, animal studies have demonstrated\r\nthat using Truvada before exposure to\r\nHIV provides significant protection to\r\nprimates that have been repeatedly exposed\r\nto an HIV-like virus.\r\nDr Ogot has been involved in several\r\nHIV studies including the relationship between\r\nthe virus and male circumcision.\r\nAccording to FHI, all study participants\r\nwill be provided with standard HIV-prevention\r\nservices such as free condoms,\r\ncounselling, screening and treatment for\r\nsexually transmitted infections.\r\nThe clinical trials will compare one\r\ngroup of participants who receive the\r\nstandard prevention services plus the pill\r\nTruvada to a second group that receives\r\nstandard prevention services plus a placebo.\r\nA placebo is a dummy medicine containing\r\nno active ingredients.\r\nParticipants who become infected during\r\nthe trial will receive counselling and\r\nreferrals to medical and social services.\r\n\u201cIf they are willing, the HIV-positive\r\nwomen will be monitored for disease progression\r\nand resistance to Truvada for at\r\nleast 12 more months,\u201d a statement from\r\nthe study researchers said.\r\nMr Paul Omullo, the project\u2019s community\r\nliaison officer, said recruiting participants\r\nhas been challenging.\r\n\u201cMany people think HIV/Aids is linked\r\nto promiscuity, so participants may be\r\nseen to be promiscuous women,\u201d said Mr\r\nOmullo.\r\n\u201cOne of the key questions is whether\r\nindividuals who get infected while on\r\nTruvada will acquire an HIV strain that is\r\nresistant to this medicine,\u201d says Dr Nelly\r\nMugo of the University of Nairobi Institute\r\nof Tropical and Infectious Diseases.\r\nIn the study, if a person becomes infected\r\neven after safety measures have been\r\nobserved, they will stop receiving Truvada\r\nand researchers will closely monitor them\r\nfor possible drug resistance.\r\nAnother challenge facing the study is\r\nthat researchers still don\u2019t know Truvada\u2019s\r\neffects on unborn children.\r\nDr Ogot says all participants will receive\r\ncontraceptives prior to and during\r\nthe study period, and pregnancy tests will\r\nbe conducted every 28 days.\r\n\u201cAnd just in case some women fall pregnant,\r\nthe study product will be discontinued\r\nimmediately. The pregnancy, as well\r\nas the infant after being born will be monitored\r\nclosely all through,\u201d says Dr Ogot."}
