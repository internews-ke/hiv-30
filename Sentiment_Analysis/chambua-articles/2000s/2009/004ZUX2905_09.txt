What projects are you handling at
the moment?
I’m running the ‘Punguza Ubao’
campaign, responding to the hunger
situation in the country. I’m also doing
peace projects in the slums and particularly
some parts of the Rift Valley, as well as HIV and
Aids awareness campaign in the police force
through music.
