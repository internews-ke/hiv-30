In a complex proc the vins will\r\nbe washed off the cells. The genetically\r\nmodified cens will then be injected back\r\ninto the patient,\r\nResearchers estimate that the pitients\r\nwould still have many (1)4 cens infected\r\nwith MIV in their body, but because the\r\nengineered cells will be resistant to the\r\nvirus, they could replicate 6ster and live\r\nlonger than the others, eventually becom\r\ning the dominam CD4 cells Rarchers\r\nsay they have seen that result when the\r\ntreatment was administered to mice.\r\nAnother study by the University of\r\nCalifornia, Los Angeles. and appearing\r\nlast week in the journal Nature Medi\r\ncine. showed similar promising results\r\nin treating 111V patIents through gene\r\ntherapy.\r\nThe treatment involved giving patients\r\nmodified blood stem oeils designed to\r\nstop 11W reproducing by targeting two\r\nkey proteins Seventy-four patients in\r\nthe trial either received the therapy, or\r\na placebo.\r\nAfter 48 weel, the researchers found\r\nthat there was no statistically significant\r\ndirence in the amoum oflllVcistulat\r\n12\r\nNuniberof 111V .ifected people to be\r\nused in a trial for new thery\r\nIng in the blood of the two groupt of pa\r\ntients.\r\nHowever, after ioo weeks, the patients\r\nwho received the therapy had higher lev\r\nels of CD4. cells \u2014 the key oeils of the\r\nimmune system that are specifically de\r\nstroyed by 111V.\r\nLead researcher, Professor Ronald Mit\r\nsuyasu, said the study lends a\u2019edence to\r\nthe concept that inserting and adminis\r\nteringa single anti-HI Vgene ina patlent\r\nown bloodstemceLlsandgivingit backto\r\nthem could reduce viral replication well\r\nenough to replace the need for a llfttiine\r\nofantiretroviral thera\r\nThe therapy comes at a time when glo\r\nbal research on 11W vaccines and micro\r\nbicide studies have shown poor results\r\nincluding an undertaking between the\r\nuniversities ofNairobi and Oxford, which\r\nwas shelved in 2006.\r\nHowever since last year. researchers\r\nfrom the universities of Nairobi and Manitoba\r\nin Canada have opened up new centres\r\nin Korogocho and Kangemi to study\r\nmore prostitutes.\r\nThe research will go on until 2010 and\r\nis expected to shed more light on why they\r\nare resistant to HIV infection.\r\nThe women being recruited now are\r\nHIV negative prostitutes, who will then\r\nbe studied for a period of three years to\r\nmonitor their responses to HIV."}
