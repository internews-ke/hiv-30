People with Aids become very ill and die of an illness that people can avoid.	
I know a lady who had a big shop. When people	found out that she and her husband were
HIV positive, they stopped going to her shop a	nd started gossiping about her. They even	
refused to greet her. She felt bad but her hus	band told her to be strong even without friends
God would take care of her and she changed and	turned to God for friendship.
