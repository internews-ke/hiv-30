{"text": "\ufeffDAILY NATION 02 SEP 2009\r\n\r\nLIVING POSITIVELY\r\nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother of two who\r\ntested positive 20 years ago. She is the executive director of\r\nthe Kenya Network of Women with Aids (KENWA).\r\nAlways on the\r\nreceiving end\r\n\r\nAs a single HIV-positive woman,\r\neverything about you provokes\r\ninstant suspicion\r\n\r\nOn the outside, she looked like she had it all. I\u2019m talking\r\nabout Magdalene, a career woman in her early 40\u2019s,\r\nalthough she looks younger than that. To say she\u2019s in good\r\nshape would be an understatement. She has what I would have\r\nto hit the gym for at least three years to attain!\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve reached the end, please respond urgently,\u201d she had\r\nwritten in her e-mail message to me. Her words raised a red flag\r\nand out of either fear or curiosity, I told her to come straight\r\nover so I could hear her story.\r\nI didn\u2019t really need any rehearsing. Dealing with people and\r\nlife issues has become such a big part of my life that I can handle\r\njust about anything without referring to any research. But I\r\nmust confess I was totally unprepared for whatever Magdalene\r\ndropped as her source of concern: \u201cAsunta I\u2019m ugly and people\r\ndon\u2019t like me!\u201d\r\nNow I\u2019ve dealt with some ugly experiences as far as HIV is\r\nconcerned, but I have never had to deal with someone who\r\nbelieves she\u2019s ugly. And not because she has HIV\u2026\r\n\u201cI\u2019m 42 and have no baby,\u201d Magdalene moaned. \u201cWomen\r\ntreat me suspiciously, as if I\u2019ll snatch their husbands. I live alone.\r\nI dress expensively, yet no one notices me. I even gave myself\r\ntime to get noticed by the right man, even the ugliest one \u2013 I\u2019m\r\nno longer particular \u2013 but a recent experience calls for me to act\r\nreal fast.\u201d\r\nMagdalene narrated how tired she felt as she left work\r\none evening. Once she got home, she called a little girl \u2013 the\r\ndaughter of a neighbour \u2013 wanting to send her to buy a packet\r\nof milk and some painkillers for a headache But before the child\r\ncould come, her mother was on Magdalene\u2019s doorstep, wagging\r\na warning finger.\r\n\u201cGive birth to your own child and experience the pain of\r\nlabour. You can\u2019t keep sending other women\u2019s children to\r\nthe shops. Am I clear?\u201d the enraged mother had screamed.\r\nThe woman went on to shout to whoever cared to listen that\r\nMagdalene had avoided giving birth so she could maintain her\r\nfigure and continue earning millions for herself.\r\nIt was a painful incident for Magdalene considering she had\r\njust lost her fianc\u00e9 to Aids-related complications. They had had a\r\ndisagreement shortly after discovering their HIV-positive status\r\nand it was during the brief communication breakdown that she\r\nlearnt her fianc\u00e9 had committed suicide without so much as\r\nleaving her a note.\r\nShe couldn\u2019t face her family and friends, who had been\r\nexpecting a wedding. After the funeral, she had sold some of her\r\nbelongings, packed her clothes and moved to Nairobi where no\r\none knew her history. She rented a one-roomed house and was\r\ntrying to heal when her angry neighbour re-opened the wound.\r\nI knew where Magdalene was coming from. Living as a single\r\nmother a decade ago, I realised that single women are closely\r\nmonitored by their married neighbours. For instance, if you\u2019re\r\nsingle, no married woman will take your genuine greeting to\r\nher husband at face value. Most will think you\u2019re interested in a\r\nrelationship with their man. I learnt to keep off lest I was accused\r\n\u2013 or even beaten \u2013 for allegedly stealing another woman\u2019s man.\r\nI once got off a matatu accompanied by a man who was\r\nattending the same IT course as me. We were excitedly\r\ndiscussing the exam we had just sat when, straight out of the\r\nblue, a woman started raining blows, kicks and insults on me. I\r\ndon\u2019t fight \u2013 not because I never have reasons to, but any time I\r\nhave tried I end up being beaten to a pulp. So I resolved at a very\r\nearly age never to get involved in a fight no matter how bad the\r\nprovocation.\r\nThe woman accused me of being a prostitute who couldn\u2019t\r\nlook for her own man; rather, I was an expert at hooking those\r\nalready attached. She used an illustration of me fishing in the\r\nbasket instead of the lake. I remember my son, Peter, witnessing\r\nthe scene miserably, as other women joined in, baying for my\r\nblood. But one thing this woman didn\u2019t know was that I was HIVinfected\r\nand had more than enough on my plate to consider sex\r\na priority in my life.\r\nFolks don\u2019t know the half of it, but there are many types\r\nof stigma that go unnoticed. In the African society, a woman\r\nwho has no child of her own is treated differently with no one\r\nbothering to find out whether it is out of decision or fate. Even\r\nwhen it is the man with the problem, the buck usually stops\r\nwith her. But with HIV, if a woman chooses not to give birth, her\r\ndecision should be respected.\r\nasuntawagura@hotmail.com"}
