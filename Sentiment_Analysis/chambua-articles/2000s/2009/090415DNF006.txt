{"text": "\ufeffWednesday April 15, 2009\r\n\r\nBy COSMAS BUTUNYI\r\nand GATONYE GATHURA\r\nKenya\u2019s foremost medical research\r\ninstitute is facing severe cutbacks\r\nas donors hold back funding following\r\nallegations of corruption.\r\nDonors are said to have lost confi dence\r\nin the Kenya Medical Research Institute\r\n(Kemri), with some withholding funds or\r\ndemanding control of cash management.\r\nA senior officer at head office said a\r\nmajor donor wants to have more say in vetting\r\npersonnel and handling procurement.\r\nOne of the premier medical research centres\r\nin Africa, Kemri has been embroiled in\r\ncorruption claims for more than a decade.\r\nFounding director Davy Koech was suspended\r\ntwo years ago to allow inspection\r\ninto alleged loss of millions of shillings.\r\nInvestigations into the alleged loss of\r\nfunds amounting to more than Sh476 million,\r\nsome of it belonging to a major international\r\npartner, the US Centers for Disease\r\nControl, are about to be completed by Kenya\r\nAnti-Corruption Commission, according to\r\nPublic Health minister Beth Mugo.\r\nWhen contacted, the CDC offi ce in Kisumu\r\nsaid they had no issues with Kemri\r\nD O N O R R E L AT I O N S\r\nKemri faces funding crisis\r\nand their programmes were on course.\r\nWithholding of funds could aff ect research\r\non malaria vaccines, child diarrhoea,\r\ndrug-resistant TB, HIV and Aids and a host\r\nof other studies being carried out in its 10\r\ncentres of \u201cexcellence\u201d. Several studies at\r\nKemri have been served with withdrawal\r\nnotices by supporting organisations.\r\nAt Kisian station in Kisumu, several\r\nstudies, whose funding runs into millions\r\nof shillings, risk stalling. In and around Kisumu,\r\nthe institute runs several studies in\r\nHIV, malaria, bilharzia and tuberculosis all\r\nfunded by various organisations.\r\nOther partners include the US Walter\r\nReed Military University and UK\u2019s Welcome\r\nTrust which partners in several major programmes\r\nat the Coast Province.\r\nJapan International Cooperation Agency,\r\na former major partner, has since pulled out\r\nafter ending programmes that have been\r\ntaken over by other Japanese interests.\r\nThe recent expose on Kemri\u2019s staff pension\r\nfund has caused donors discomfort. A\r\nsource at one of the outreach centres says\r\nof immediate concern are grants worth\r\n$200,000 (Sh16 million) covering HIV, bilharzia\r\nand malaria work. \u201cOur fears are that\r\nif one donor gives out wrong signals others\r\ncould tag along with a possible snowballing\r\neff ect,\u201d the source said.\r\nLoss of over half a billion shillings from\r\nthe personnel pension fund and some more\r\nfrom an account belonging to the CDC has\r\ncaused a \u2018go-slow among some donors.\u2019\r\n\u201cDonors argue, if the workers\u2019 pension\r\nfund could be misappropriated, how about\r\nthe research grants?\u201d the source posed.\r\nApart from the major institutional donors,\r\nthere are small partners who come\r\nin for short-term studies in collaboration\r\nwith Kemri. A source at Kemri, who spoke\r\non condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals,\r\nsaid scientists have had to write\r\n\u2018comfort notes\u2019 assuring the donors that\r\nthe issue is being addressed.\r\n\u201cThe donors have written to us expressing\r\ntheir discomfort in releasing research\r\ngrants, which are normally channelled\r\nthrough Kemri accounts,\u201d he explained.\r\nEff orts to get a comment from the management\r\nwas futile as the director was\r\nsaid to be out of the country. Her deputy\r\nfor fi nancial and administrative issues, Dr\r\nPatrick Orege, was also out of the country.\r\nPossible freeze on grants is giving scientists\r\naffi liated to Kemri sleepless nights. A\r\nweek ago, Mrs Mugo formed a new board to\r\nlook into the issues aff ecting Kemri.\r\nKemri head\r\noffice in Nairobi.\r\nThe prospect of\r\nfreezing research\r\ngrants is giving\r\nmany scientists\r\nsleepless nights.\r\nPhoto/FILE"}
