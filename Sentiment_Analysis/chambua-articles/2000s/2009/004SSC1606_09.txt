MAJOR KILLERS OF CHILDREN

The major killers
of children are
common childhood
illnesses:
• 24 per cent of
children die as a
result of newborn
conditions, such
as infections,
asphyxia or
breathing difficulty
and complications
arising from a
preterm birth
• 20 per cent die
from pneumonia
• 17 per cent from
diarrhoea
• 15 per cent from
HIV and AIDS; and
• 14 per cent from
malaria.
• More than a half
of the children
succumb to
these conditions
because they are
malnourished, and
their bodies cannot
therefore fight back
