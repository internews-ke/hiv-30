{"text": "\ufeffTuesday November 17, 2009\r\n\r\nBy GATONYE GATHURA\r\nCoastal women threatening\r\nto strip over\r\nteenage use of narcotics\r\nmay not just\r\nbe crying wolf; new evidence\r\nindicates that abusers share\r\nnot only needles but possibly\r\ntheir blood.\r\nCalled flash blood, it is a\r\ncash-saving technique where\r\na user injects himself with heroin\r\nor other illicit substances\r\nand then draws a syringe full\r\nof blood which he passes to a\r\nsecond user to inject himself.\r\nFlashing blood\r\nThe practice was fi rst detected\r\nin Dar es Salaam two years ago\r\nand it is suspected that youths\r\nalong the Kenyan coast were\r\nnow using it.\r\n\u201cAn abnormally high rate of\r\nHIV and hepatitis infection\r\namong injecting drug users\r\nat the Kenyan coast points to\r\n\u2018fl ashing of blood\u2019 among local\r\nusers,\u201d says Dr Timothy Mugusia,\r\nwho has just completed a\r\nnew study on drug abuse in\r\nMombasa and Kilindini districts.\r\nThe study, sponsored by the National\r\nAids Control Council and\r\ncarried out by DARAT, a Mombasa-\r\nbased non-governmental\r\norganisation in February, says a\r\nsample of 120 narcotic users including\r\ninjectors in Mombasa\r\nand Kilindini districts indicated\r\nan exceptionally high prevalence\r\nof hepatitis C and HIV infections.\r\n\u201cOver 70 per cent of them were\r\nfound to be infected with hepatitis\r\nC while half of them were\r\nHIV positive,\u201d Dr Mugusia told\r\nthe Nation.\r\nHigh prevalence\r\nSeveral women in Mombasa\r\nhave threatened to strip publicly\r\nunless the government\r\nmoved fast to arrest the escalating\r\nnarcotics use among the\r\nyouth in the region.\r\nThe women argue that\r\nthe drugs compromised the\r\nyouth\u2019s capacity to engage in\r\neither productive or reproduction\r\nactivities. And, Dr Mugusia\r\nsays the increased use of\r\ninjecting drugs and sharing\r\nof needles will further complicate\r\nthe problem of drug abuse\r\nat the Coast.\r\nThe study, A Rapid Assessment\r\nof Injecting Drug use\r\nin Mombasa and Kilindini\r\nDistricts, identifi ed 40 sites,\r\ncalled maskani in the users\u2019\r\nlanguage, where the teenagers\r\nmeet to share drugs.\r\nAccording to the study,\r\nwhile bhang is still a popular\r\ndrug it is quickly being overtaken\r\nby injected heroin with\r\n70 per cent of the respondents\r\nsaying they use it.\r\nThe fi rst incidents of \u201cfl ash\r\nblood\u201d were reported by researchers\r\nSheryl McUrdy of\r\nthe University of Texas in the\r\nUS and Paul Kilonzo of the\r\nUniversity of Dar es Salaam in\r\nTanzania in a study published\r\nin the African Journal of Drug\r\n& Alcohol Studies in 2006.\r\nThose who get the secondary\r\ninjection, explains Dr Mugusia,\r\nbelieve they will get a\r\n\u201chigh\u201d because the originator\r\nhad injected heroin into their\r\nblood. But this he says can\r\nonly give a very low satisfaction\r\nbecause of the possible\r\nlow concentration of the drug\r\ncomponent.\r\nThe study found that most\r\nof the users and those addicted\r\nto be in their early 20s. \u201cIn\r\nour study area of Mombasa\r\nand Kilindini,\u201d says Dr Mugusia,\r\n\u201cwe estimate there are\r\nover 6,000 drug injectors.\u201d"}
