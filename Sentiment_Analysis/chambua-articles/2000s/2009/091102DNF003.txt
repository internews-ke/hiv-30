{"text": "\ufeffDAILY NATION Monday November 2, 2009\r\nProf Were suggests\r\nsimple disinfection\r\nmethod that will\r\nkeep diarrhoea it bay\r\n\r\nBy JOHN NGIRACHU\r\nbottle of water placed on a piece\r\nof shiny roofing iron sheet may\r\nnot look like something that\r\nvould prevent disease, but ac\r\ncording to a leading Kenyan scientist, it\r\nis a simple, vet effective, way to keep diar\r\nrhoea at bay.\r\nWhat of a book with a record of one\u2019s\r\nhealth from birth, and the tests carried\r\nout on one and the myriad pricks and in\r\njections one has had up to the age of five\r\nor even 20 years?\r\nAccording to Prof Miriam Were, an\r\naward-winning scientist and National\r\nAids Control Council chairperson, the\r\nadoption of these apparently simple but\r\ntested methods could be crucial in the\r\nfight ainst child deaths\r\nExpensive ways\r\nProf Were bubbles with enthusiasm when\r\nshe speaks about the methods she says\r\ncould be used before sophisticated and\r\nexpensive ways are available to the mil\r\nlions of poor people in black Africa.\r\nShe says that, for instance, the bottle\r\nin-the-sun method is easy to adopt and\r\ncheap to implement, meaning that the\r\nmillions of Nairobi slum dwellers with\r\nout access to clean water, or rural people\r\nwho do not have piped water, could ben\r\nefit greatly.\r\nThe solar water disinfection uses the\r\nsun\u2019s ultra-violet ra to kill germs in\r\ndrinking water. The water is put in a plas\r\ntic bottle and then in the sun for at least\r\nsix hours.\r\nThe method has been proved to kill E.\r\ncoil, a bacterium that causes food poison\r\ning. and one of the main causes of diar\r\nrhoea. It kills the bacterium when the\r\nwater is exposed to the sun for a day when\r\nit is bright, or two days when it is cloudy\r\n\u201cIt requires a raised surfa\u0153 and a piece\r\nof shiny mabati to work:\u2019 says Prof Were.\r\n\u201cIn the rural areas, the rack that is used\r\nfor airing utensils may be used. We know\r\npiped water is ideal, but before it becomes\r\navailable for all, this could work.\u201d\r\nThe method has been proved to work\r\nin parts that lie between 35 degrees north\r\nand south of the Equator; and Africa lies\r\nsmack in the middle of the two latitudes.\r\nShe made her presentation on the\r\nfourth day of the global health confer\r\nenoe at Kenyatta International Confer\r\nence Centre, Nairobi, last Thursday.\r\nThe conference that closed on Friday\r\nwith the development of the Nairobi Call\r\nfor Action, was attended by health profes\r\nsionals from all parts of the world. This\r\nwas the first time it was being held in Af\r\nrica, and Thursday was the \u2018frica thy\u201d\r\non which focus was on health promotion\r\nfor the continent.\r\nThe Thursday morning session was\r\ndominated by calls for policy-makers to\r\nfocus on the \u00e1\u00c4frican experienoe\u201d to get\r\nsolutions to the myriad problems facing\r\nthe continent.\r\nProf Were\u2019s second suggestion was the\r\nmaternal and child health handbook,\r\nwhich is the result of studies in Nigeria\r\nthat show that mothers could be bet\r\nter than hospitals in keeping the card\r\ncontaining the record of their children\r\nprogress from the pre-natal phase to five\r\nyears.\r\nIn Japan, the method has been proved\r\nto work especially where a record of the\r\nmother\u2019s pregnancy and the child\u2019s medi\r\ncal history were placed in one book up to\r\n\u201811w solar water\r\ndisinfection uses the sun\u2019s\r\nultra-violet rays to kill\r\ngerms in drinking water\r\nage five. It has been practised there forGO\r\nyears, and in some provinces, records are\r\nkept for up to 20 years. The book is then\r\nhanded over to the bridegroom to prove\r\nthat his bride is healthy.\r\nProf Were argued that the adoption of\r\nthe process could help in strengthening\r\nmedical eare and push efforts to attain\r\nMillennium Development Goals four and\r\nfive. Goal four involves reducing child\r\nmortality, while five is intended to im\r\nprove maternal health.\r\nFrom World Health Organisation\r\nrecords, black Africa currently lags be\r\nhind other regions in attaining the goals\r\nset at the UN Millennium Summit in Sep\r\ntember 2000. \u201cKenya is unlikely to meet\r\nthe MDG targets by 2015 at the current\r\nrates. A lot needs to be done:\u2019 said Public\r\nHealth assistant minister James Gesami\r\nat the meeting.\r\nProf Were\u2019s ideas received support\r\nfrom Zimbabwe\u2019s Health minister, Dr\r\nHenry Madzorera. \u201cWe can\u2019t have break\r\nthroughs in solving Africa\u2019s health issues\r\nby depending on the experiences of the\r\nWest\u2019 he said.\r\n\u201cThe African experien\u0153 in getting rid\r\nof poverty and disease is like the life of a\r\nbutterfly, and we need our own efforts to\r\n2015\r\nThe year Millennium Development\r\nGoals should have been achieved\r\nbreak out of our cocoons\u2019\r\nProf Were\u2019s ideas also resonated with a\r\nproposal by Dr Florence Muli-Musiime,\r\nthe African Medical Research Foundation\r\n(Amref) deputy director.\r\nDr Muli-Musiime said the adoption of\r\nsimpLe and tested strategies should be ex\r\nplored before governments and NGOs in\r\ndulge in endless research and the so-called\r\nnew strategies. \u201cThere have been too many\r\ngood pilot projects and success stories.\r\nMuch is spent on funding new approaches\r\nrather than upscaling simple, established\r\nand successful projects,\u201d she noted.\r\nShe cited projects in South Africa in\r\nwhich traditional healers refer poible\r\n11W patients to modern doctors and the\r\ntraining of clinical officers in Southern\r\nSudan to carry out simple operations that\r\nare usually the preserve of doctors."}
