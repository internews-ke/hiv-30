{"text": "\ufeffDAILY NATION Wednesday December 2, 2009\r\n\r\nWORLD AIDS DAY\r\nWHEN VIRUS WAS AS GOOD AS SUICIDE\r\n\r\nBy JOY WANJA\r\nShe bubbles with enthusiasm and\r\nwears a broad smile everyday,\r\nthanks to her daughter, who was 12\r\nat a time she contemplated suicide.\r\nMs Jane Aida, 40, tested positive to HIV\r\nin 2001 and harboured suicidal thoughts,\r\nbut her daughter encouraged her to be positive\r\nto see her three children grow up.\r\nToday, she is grateful for her daughter,\r\nVivianne. And she draws her strength\r\nfrom the red ribbon that symbolises the\r\nfight against Aids.\r\nSingle mother\r\nThe single mother of three contemplated\r\nsuicide to escape from stigma and discrimination\r\nthat was then associated with\r\npeople living with HIV.\r\n\u201cA death sentence had been handed\r\ndown, and I felt I did not deserve to live\r\na minute longer,\u201d Ms Aida remembers\r\nthinking as she wrote her will.\r\nTwo years shy of a decade today, Ms\r\nAida is full of optimism for life, and is a\r\nmentor and crusader in the HIV and Aids\r\nwar. In her funeral plans, she thought\r\nabout having a special coffin to mark the\r\nend of her four-decades of life.\r\nMs Aida, a support staff at the Kenyatta\r\nNational Hospital, owes her life today\r\nto her daughter, now aspiring to join the\r\nuniversity and study psychology. Vivianne\r\nMomanyi, 20, sat the KCSE exams this\r\nyear at Le Pic Secondary School.\r\n\u201cI looked at her innocent eyes and humble\r\nplea, then swore I was going to live for\r\nher,\u201d Ms Aida says.\r\nTrouble, she says, began when her partner\r\npassed away in 2000. She had no idea\r\nabout the illness he had succumbed to, as\r\ndoctors never disclosed.\r\nA year after his death, she sought medical\r\nattention and was diagnosed as HIVShe\r\ncould have\r\ncommitted suicide\r\n11 years ago,\r\nwere it not for her\r\ndaughter. Ms Jane\r\nAida has lived\r\nwith HIV since\r\nthen, and talked\r\nto the Nation\r\nyesterday about\r\nher life. Photo/\r\nJAMES NJUGUNA\r\nA death sentence had\r\nbeen handed down, and\r\nI didn\u2019t deserve to live\r\na minute longer. (But) I\r\nlooked at her eyes and\r\nhumble plea and swore I\r\nwas going to live for her\r\npositive, a status she says was both unexpected\r\nand scary.\r\nThe initial results revealed that her CD4\r\ncount was low, which prompted medics to\r\nimmediately place her on anti-retroviral\r\ntherapy. A normal CD4 count in a man\r\nwithout HIV infection is between 400 to\r\n1200 cells per cubic millimetre of blood,\r\nand 500 to 1600 in women.\r\nCD4 count is a marker of likely disease\r\nprogression. Initially in HIV infection\r\nthere is a sharp drop in the CD4 count,\r\nas the immune system is being damaged\r\nby HIV.\r\nDoctors counsel that if one\u2019s count falls\r\nbelow 250, then treatment of ARVs is initiated\r\nto boost the body\u2019s immunity and\r\nprevent it form further infections.\r\n\u201cBut after I talked to a friend, she encouraged\r\nme to deal with denial and\r\nall else would be bearable,\u201d she told the\r\nNation yesterday during celebrations to\r\nmark the World Aids Day at KNH.\r\nThe mother of two girls and a boy aged\r\nbetween 16 and 22 asks parents to be open\r\nnot only on issues pertaining to Aids but\r\nalso sex and relationships to block, especially\r\nteens, from wrong information.\r\nTwelve months after she tested positive,\r\nMs Aida went public about her status to\r\ncreate awareness amongst her colleagues\r\non the importance of knowing their status\r\nand adopting a healthy attitude.\r\nAt one time during her medication, she\r\nabandoned the ARVs and opted for traditional\r\nmedicine, which she says led to a\r\nfast deterioration of her health before she\r\nwas put on the second line of ARVs.\r\nToday she is part of a team of 40 health\r\nstaff at KNH that have united to discuss\r\nand empower colleagues in the hospital\r\nand the public.\r\nKenstaff, she says, comprises doctors,\r\nnurses, technicians, and support staff\r\namongst other health workers also affected\r\nby the disease.\r\nShe has discussed her status with all\r\nher children.\r\nAs Kenya marked a decade today of\r\nmanaging HIV as a national disaster,\r\npersons living with HIV like Ms Aida are\r\ngrateful that the fight has intensified and\r\nthe rate of infections has declined.\r\nBased on this year\u2019s theme, Universal\r\nAccess and Human Rights, global leaders\r\npledged to work towards universal HIV\r\nand Aids prevention, treatment and care.\r\nThey made a call to recognise this right as\r\na fundamental human right."}
