It is also a country with the highest in\ufb02ation\r\n rate in the world at 231 million per cent, and where\r\n vast tracts of fertile land lie fallow after Mr Mugabe\r\n appropriated by force land from white farmers.\r\n    At the same time, millions of Zimbabweans have\r\n \ufb02ed to neighbouring South Africa and Botswana to\r\n escape the economic crisis spawned by Mr Mugabe\u2019s\r\n dictatorial rule.\r\n    It is obvious that a solution to the Zimbabwean cri-                                                         WHAT OTHERS SAY\r\n sis would remove a major burden from the backs of\r\n its neighbours.
