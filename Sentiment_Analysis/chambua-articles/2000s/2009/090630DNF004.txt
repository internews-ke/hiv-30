{"text": "\ufeffTuesday June 30, 2009 DAILY NATION\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY\r\nDONT PANIC, THE FLU IS NOT AS DEADLY AS WE FIRST THOUGHT\r\n\r\nKenyans should not panic following\r\nconfirmation of the country\u2019s first\r\ncase of swine flu as available information\r\nsuggests the disease is not\r\nas deadly as first thought.\r\nAlthough World Health Organisation\r\ndeclared the flu, caused by the\r\nH1N1 virus, a global pandemic on\r\nJune 11, this did not imply that it\r\nwas a killer disease on the scale of\r\nAids or Ebola.\r\nThe latter kills up to 90 per cent of\r\nthose who contract it within days.\r\nContrary to public perception, the\r\nterm used by WHO \u2014 pandemic\r\n\u2014 to describe H1N1 is used when a\r\ndisease covers a wide geographical\r\narea and does not necessarily apply\r\nto mortality (death) rate.\r\nIn fact, all evidence points to the\r\nconclusion that H1N1 is not as devastating\r\nas initially thought, with\r\nits death rate probably being in the\r\nlower single digit percentage (probably\r\nmuch lower than 5 per cent).\r\nSo far, for example, out of the estimated\r\none million cases in America\r\n(of which about 30,000 have been\r\nconfirmed), only 127 people have\r\nbeen confirmed to have died of the\r\nflu.\r\nThe outbreak in Kenya is also not\r\nentirely unexpected. H1N1 has been\r\nreported in more than 70 countries,\r\nwith the most recent cases in\r\ncountries as far apart as Myanmar,\r\nLithuania and Guatemala.\r\nGIVEN KENYA\u2019S POSITION AS\r\nthe regional travel hub as well as the\r\nfact that there are more than one\r\nmillion Kenyans living abroad, it was\r\ninevitable that the disease would\r\neventually reach here.\r\nElsewhere, the availability of effective\r\nanti-virals means that H1N1\r\nis unlikely, in its current form, to\r\nsnowball into a major public health\r\ncrisis on the scope of HIV and Aids.\r\nAlthough Kenya has fairly limited\r\nstocks of these medicines, which\r\ninclude Tamiflu, supplies can easily\r\nbe boosted if the need arises.\r\nWorld Health Organisation has\r\nenough drugs around the world to\r\ntreat up to 5 million people.\r\nThese stockpiles are a testament\r\nto another fact that is not often\r\nacknowledged \u2014 that the world is\r\ntoday more prepared to deal with\r\npandemics like H1N1 than ever\r\nbefore, many of the lessons learnt in\r\ncurbing new outbreaks coming from\r\nHIV and Aids.\r\nAs a result, health experts across\r\nthe world have recognised the need\r\nfor continued disease surveillance\r\nand quick response mechanisms, as\r\nwell as the establishment of global\r\nnetworks to collaborate in research,\r\ndiagnosis and treatment.\r\nIt is instructive, in the case of H1N1,\r\nthat the Kenya Medical Research\r\nInstitute, which confirmed the index\r\ncase is part of the network of WHOaccredited\r\nlaboratories that act as\r\nreference institutions.\r\nIn the last five years, these medical\r\nnetworks have helped the world\r\ndeal with two other major scares,\r\nSars and bird-flu, both from Asia.\r\nGIVEN THE KNOWN FACTS ABOUT\r\nH1N1, as well as the global infrastructure\r\nestablished to deal with\r\noutbreaks, it is clear why experts\r\nsay that there is cause for optimism\r\nwith the latest outbreak.\r\nBarring any unforeseen mutations\r\nor interactions with other viruses,\r\nH1N1 is likely to go the way of its\r\ntwo precursors, Sars and bird flu.\r\nKenyans or anybody else, however,\r\nshould not drop their guard."}
