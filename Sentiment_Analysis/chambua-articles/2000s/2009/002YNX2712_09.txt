HIV QUOTES:
	
Even though one does not have the virus, he/she	is aﬀected in some way or other,
chill and seal.

At the beginning people thought HIV/Aids was wi	tchcraft. Before two people get
married, medical test should be carried out to	ﬁnd out their status.

HIV has aﬀected life expectancy rates in Kenya.	Spirituality is important. I must
		
relate to my God at all times and be honest and	joyful. I will join support groups that
will keep me focused and I will ﬁnd out how I c	an help children who are affected.

I know a young boy who was infected when he was	circumcised. One knife was	
used on several boys. When he got sick we were	all shocked. Sadly people isolated
him and his family. Aids patients need love and	care.

I thank the media for highlighting the dangers	of HIV/Aids continually. It is has
		
affected Kenya’s labour force and created orphans, widows and widowers.

Live your life as if all around you are positiv	e and avoid irresponsible behavior.
Irresponsible sexually behavior can be avoided if one critically looks at it and
realizes that it has no advantages. Also never judge a book by its cover. I know a
prostitute from Kibera who died with her young child but the gentleman who used to 
go out with her is alive and looks healthy ﬁve years on but I know this does not
mean he is not an HIV carrier.
