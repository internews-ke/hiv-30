{"text": "\ufeffDAILY NATION Wednesday December 9, 2009\r\n\r\nRosalid\u2019s* e-mail was brief and ominous: \u201cAsunta, please call\r\nme urgently, or else \u2026\u201d She had given her phone number. I\r\ndidn\u2019t want to take chances so I called her immediately.\r\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m going through \u2026 unless you help me, I\u2019m going to\r\nkill myself and the baby I\u2019m carrying,\u201d she said.\r\n\u201cPlease come to our office and I\u2019ll personally see you.\u201d\r\n\u201cSo when did you know you were infected \u2026?\u201d I blurted out\r\nwhen she arrived.\r\n\u201cNo, it has nothing to do with HIV,\u201d she didn\u2019t even let me\r\nfinish the question. \u201cBut I\u2019d rather deal with HIV than what I\u2019m\r\ngoing through.\u201d\r\nYou see, owing to my own situation and my life\u2019s work, I tend\r\nto think that all the most serious, life-threatening issues have\r\neverything to do with HIV.\r\n\u201cMy husband and I separated after a domestic spat. I moved\r\nout with our kid. Of course, I knew we\u2019d return to him, but I\r\nwanted to teach him a lesson.\u201d\r\nApparently, Rosalid was prepared to make her marriage\r\nwork, so after work, she would go to her local priest, who was\r\nextremely supportive, for marital counselling. One evening after\r\nthe session, the priest asked her to accompany him to see a\r\nfriend. \u201cSince I was doing nothing, I decided to accompany him\r\nand before long, we arrived at a party,\u201d she said.\r\n\u201cAnd?\u201d\r\n\u201cOne thing led to the other. We drank wine and I don\u2019t\r\nremember how I ended in my bed with a priest.\u201d\r\nMy jaw dropped. A priest, of all people? Then, remembering\r\nthat I should never judge a client, I straightened my face.\r\nSpeaking of judging, I\u2019ve also been caught up in compromising\r\nsituations and almost succumbed to sex-related temptations.\r\nI\u2019m no angel. At one time a platonic relationship with a member\r\nof the opposite sex almost went too far, and I could feel myself\r\nlosing control. But I was saved in the nick of time by the small,\r\ninsistent voice that warned me of the possible consequences: reinfection\r\nwith HIV, an unplanned pregnancy, a broken heart.\r\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s that one-night stand that resulted in this pregnancy.\r\nI informed the priest about it, but he advised me to get rid of it\r\nbefore his church got to know about it,\u201d Rosalid continued.\r\nCall it fate but while all this was happening, she happened to\r\nread my pro-life article, in which I said that nobody should take\r\nan unborn baby\u2019s life.\r\n\u201cAsunta, I knew I had to see you because I think you\u2019re a\r\ngodsend.\u201d\r\nShe wanted me to tell her what to do because she had\r\nreconciled with her husband and intended to return home. Now,\r\nI don\u2019t know whether the advice I gave her was professional\r\nor motivated by plain emotion because I told her that the first\r\npriority was the life forming inside her.\r\n\u201cThis life isn\u2019t responsible for the circumstances that led to its\r\nconception, but God has put you in a position to decide its fate.\u201d\r\n\u201cAre you advising me to carry this pregnancy to term? What\r\nabout my marriage?\u201d she asked\r\n\u201cWho knows what you\u2019re carrying? You and your husband\r\nare going to be reunited through mutual consent, but the baby\r\nyou\u2019re carrying is your flesh and blood. Live with it.\u201d\r\nAt this point I could see that Rosalid had changed her mind.\r\nShe didn\u2019t even let me finish my counselling-cum-sermon.\r\n\u201cNo matter what, I\u2019ll keep the baby. It\u2019s mine,\u201d she said with\r\nconviction, although I knew that the road ahead would be rough\r\nfor her.\r\nI\u2019ve talked to women who have had abortions and one thing\r\nthey all tell me is that they\u2019ve never been able to forget. And\r\nit\u2019s even worse for those who find they cannot have children\r\nlater \u2013 when they want them \u2013 because of abortion-related\r\ncomplications.\r\nHowever, this isn\u2019t just about one unfortunate woman\u2019s\r\nmarriage on the rocks, unplanned pregnancy and abortion. It\u2019s\r\nabout the foreseen and unforeseen consequences of our sexual\r\nbehaviour. Rosalid was so anxious about being pregnant that I\r\ndoubt she had stopped to think that she might have got infected\r\nwith HIV. HIV is no respecter of persons, and I have friends\r\namong the clergy who are living with HIV and who, if \u201cone thing\r\nled to another\u201d, could end up infecting their partners.\r\nAnd then there\u2019s the issue of protection. Rosalid isn\u2019t alone. A\r\ngood number of sisters nowadays use emergency contraceptive\r\npills \u2013 forgoing safer sex options \u2013 yet the former cannot protect\r\nthem against sexually transmitted infections. Is it just me, or is\r\nHIV slowly being relegated to the back burner?"}
