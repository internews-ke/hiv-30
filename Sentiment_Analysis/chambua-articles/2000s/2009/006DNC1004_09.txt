Kenya back in Aids
donor’s good books
By NATION Reporter

Kenya is back in the good
books of a global agency that
funds the fi ght against Aids
and will now receive Sh13 billion
to buy anti-retrovirals.
The Global Fund had halted
assistance to Kenya two years
ago because of concerns of
misuse of funds.
Kenya’s failure to win the
fund’s support was linked
to rampant corruption in
the health sector, including
doubts about the country’s
programmes for HIV and malaria.
At least 2.5 million people
are infected with HIV in
Kenya, and about 36,000 children
under age fi ve die of malaria
each year.
All conditions
Medical Services PS James
ole Kiyiapi said yesterday the
funds will now be disbursed
after the government fulfi lled
all the conditions stipulated by
the fund.
Kenya submitted proposals
to the fund’s board at the end
of September last year for the
second round of grants.
He said that the fi rst phase
of the disbursement will be
around Sh3.7 billion out of
which Sh1.3 billion will be distributed
to non-governmental
organisations through Care International.
The PS gave assurance that
the funds would not be misused
again.
Dismissing claims that there
was fi erce infi ghting between
the two ministries, Dr Kiyiapi
said the Public Health ministry
runs the major HIV and
Aids programme, while his
ministry deals with treatment
and care.
“There is no infi ghting between
the two ministries as
roles were clearly defined
when the Grand Coalition was
formed,” he said.
He said that procurement is
done by joint committees, and
no single outfi t can claim to
have a dominating authority.
Prof Kiyiapi said all prevention
and mobilisation
campaigns, including services
rendered in dispensaries,
clinics and community-based
facilities, are not done by his
ministry.
The Global Fund is one of
the largest supporters of Kenya’s
Aids programmes together
with the US President’s Emergency
Plan for Aids Relief,
which provides about Sh16
billion annually.
