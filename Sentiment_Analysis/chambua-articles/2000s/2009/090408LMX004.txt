{"text": "\ufeffWEDNESDAY APRIL 8, 2009\r\n\r\nLIVING POSITIVELY\r\nThere are several\r\nopportunities to meet\r\nwith the Creator\r\nLast week I attended Prayer Day at my\r\nson\u2019s school. Many times I don\u2019t really\r\npay attention as preachers repeat what\r\nI\u2019ve heard countless times before. Indeed,\r\nsometimes I switch them off and switch on to\r\nother matters as they drone on. But this time,\r\nfor some inexplicable reason, I listened to the\r\nsermon like my life depended on it.\r\nThe theme was something that makes most\r\nof us shift uncomfortably in our seats: giving.\r\nNot just perfunctory giving, but the one that\u2019s\r\ndone unconditionally. To say the sermon\r\nopened my eyes would be an understatement.\r\nWhen it comes to giving, I think I score nine\r\nout of 10. For instance, following a call last\r\nyear to help those affected by the post-election\r\nviolence, I went through every wardrobe in\r\nmy house and selected what we hadn\u2019t worn\r\nor used in a long time. And I can\u2019t count the\r\nnumber of HIV people who have lived with me\r\nwhile they recuperated.\r\nBut that, according to the sermon, was not\r\nenough. \u201cIt\u2019s not about giving what we don\u2019t\r\nrequire,\u201d the preacher said. \u201cIt\u2019s about giving\r\nwhat we love, what we need most.\u201d\r\nThe preacher gave the first example: \u201cGod\r\ngave His only begotten son Jesus Christ\u2026\u201d\r\n\u201cOh, my! You mean giving means I should\r\nsurrender one of my sons?\u201d I asked myself.\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s too much. Only God can do that.\u201d\r\n\u201cThe other example is Abraham, who was\r\nwilling to sacrifice his only son\u2026\u201d Fast and\r\nfurious, he gave more Biblical examples of\r\nunconditional givers \u2013 ordinary mortals who\r\ngave extraordinarily.\r\nHow many times have I turned God away\r\nbecause I didn\u2019t have a surplus or, more\r\nprecisely, I didn\u2019t have what I don\u2019t require?\r\nAnd how come in all the years I\u2019ve read the\r\nScriptures and been in community service it\r\nhasn\u2019t once dawned on me that it\u2019s only in true\r\ngiving that I can meet God?\r\n\u201cChurch, whenever you\u2019re giving\r\nunconditionally you\u2019re having a face-to-face\r\nmeeting with God.\u201d\r\nThe sermon caused me to reflect on my\r\nwork. Am I in the HIV sub-sector because\r\nit\u2019s a calling or a business? I know there are\r\nthose of us who have formed non-government\r\norganisations not because of what we hope to\r\nsow but because of what we\u2019ll reap. I\u2019ve been\r\nat it long enough to know how easy it is for one\r\nto get priorities mixed up. But if I know what\r\nI stand for \u2013 that mine is a calling and not a\r\nbusiness venture \u2013 I won\u2019t fall for anything.\r\nThis reminds me of a Good Samaritan who\r\ncalled our office a month ago and insisted she\r\nwanted me to be present when she dropped\r\nher donation. To our surprise, she gave us\r\nbrand new clothes she had bought abroad.\r\n\u201cYou mean one can donate new clothes?\u201d\r\nwe wondered, feeling challenged after she had\r\nleft, and recalling the way we usually donate\r\nonly the rags we don\u2019t want!\r\nThrough these experiences, God taught me\r\nsomething: giving is about sharing my best and\r\nblessing someone else. In addition, in giving\r\nwhat I don\u2019t need or require, I miss out on the\r\nopportunity to meet God.\r\nDivine encounters occur in all manner of\r\nplaces. God is in the face of the emaciated\r\nwoman eating wild berries, and the\r\nmalnourished baby suckling her mother\u2019s\r\nempty breast. This Easter, I pray that God\r\nwould open your inner eyes like He did mine.\r\nThis Easter, give cheerfully.\r\nasuntawagura@hotmail.com\r\nMeeting God\r\nwhen we give\r\nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother\r\nof two who tested positive 20 years ago.\r\nShe is the executive director of the Kenya\r\nNetwork of Women with Aids (KENWA)."}
