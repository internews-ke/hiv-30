TELL AUNTIE LIZ

Did I contract
Aids?
Dear Auntie Liz,
I am in Class Eight and a
week ago while on tuition
we started suspecting
that a fellow schoolmate
could be HIV positive. He
is sickly and always out of
school due to this or that
illness. His parents are HIV
positive. But my worry
is that I shared a spoon
with him. My friends later
started telling me that I
got infected with the virus.
It’s really got into my head
and now I am very worried
and stressed. Please help.
Dick,
Nairobi
Dear Dick,
Your have raised a
sensitive and important
issue. First, it’s got to do
with an understanding,
or lack of it, regarding
how the AIDS virus
is transmitted. This is
what fuels your fear of
contracting Aids because
you shared a spoon with
someone who is suspected
to have the virus. Second,
is the stigmatisation that
face people believed to
be living with AIDS. It is
bad enough for an adult
to face stigma but worse
for a child. This is why
you need to show your
schoolmate love and not
run away from him, if
indeed he is HIV positive.
But remember these are
just rumours. Unless he has
been tested and found to
be HIV positive, it is wrong
to spread such a rumour.
It is wrong to assume he is
HIV positive, just because
his parents are.
To address your
problem, you need to
know the facts about
transmission of HIV, which
many young people of
your age may be unaware
of. It’s highly unlikely that
you can contract Aids by
sharing a spoon. HIV is
also not transmitted by
sharing a classroom desk,
through insect bite, casual
contact or by sharing food.
There is no risk of catching
the HIV virus by talking,
eating, drinking, sharing
toilets and towel with
people living with AIDS.
HIV is transmitted in three
ways:
Through unprotected
sex with an infected man
or woman.
By infected blood
entering the blood stream
through sharing injection
needles, transfusion of
infected blood or blood
products and through
needle injuries, etc.
From a woman with HIV
to her baby either during
pregnancy, or during
delivery.
There is no evidence
to show that one can
contract HIV through
social contact. Hugging
and touching as well as
being close to infected
people pose no risk of
infection. So you should
socialise freely with your
schoolmate whether he is
HIV positive or not. You
and your colleagues need
to discard the myths about
HIV/Aids and help break
the stigma immediately.
Is it right
to have a
girlfriend?
Dear Auntie Liz,
I am 15 years old and I live
in Nairobi. Many of my
friends have boyfriends
and girlfriends. Most of
them spend all their free
time just hanging out
with their partners. A few
weeks ago, a girl asked
me out for a date but I did
not accept because I am
not sure if it is right for
me to have a girlfriend at
this age. Please advise if I
should ask the girl out for
a date or not.
John,

Dear John,
Thank you for sharing your
concerns with me. Some
boys and girls may start
dating early, while others
postpone till much later,
even in their 20s. While it
is good to delay dating, a
majority of young people
are simply unable to do it.
When you delay dating, it
helps you to focus entirely
on appropriate activities
that will build skills you will
need as a teen and young
adult. You will instead
spend more time playing
and having fun with samesex
friends.
These friendships help
youth learn many skills
about getting along with
others. So it gets easier
when eventually you start
dating. Boys and girls who
start dating early probably
won’t learn some of the
skills that they will need to
have healthy relationships
later on. When you delay
dating, it also means you
reduce chances of being
involved in early sexual
activity which may lead
to pregnancy and expose
you to sexually transmitted
diseases like HIV/AIDS.
I understand why you
are hesitant to take on a
girlfriend. Do not let her
push this idea into you if you are not
ready. One reason that may push you
into early dating is peer pressure.
Specialists say young people need
a sense of personal identity before
they can be really close to another
person. In other words, if a young
person does not know who he or
she really is, what he or she likes and
dislikes, and what his or her values
are, that boy or girl cannot have a
healthy relationship with a person of
the opposite sex. So there is nothing
wrong with having a girlfriend so
long as you know your limits.
