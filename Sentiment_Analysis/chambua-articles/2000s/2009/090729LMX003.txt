{"text": "\ufeff\ufeffDAILY NATION WEDNESDAY JULY 29, 2009\r\nTHE NIGHT THAT CHANGED MY LIFE\r\n\r\nAs debate rages on about the Waki envelope, many like 42-year-old Faith\r\nAkinyi can\u2019t understand the delayed justice. \r\n\r\nAs told to MILLICENT MWOLOLO\r\n\r\nThere was a time when my family lacked for nothing. We lived in our own house in Nairobi and my kids were driven to and from school. I had a thriving \t \r\nbusiness and travelled all over the major \t \r\nEast African markets \u2013 Kampala, Malaba, \t \r\nDar es Salaam, Kigali \u2013 delivering curios \t \r\nand purchasing garments for sale. I had \t \r\nabout 10 employees and business was \t \r\nbooming\u2026 I could easily afford to pay \t \r\nfor my children\u2019s holiday trips as well as \t \r\nprovide a wide variety of foods for their \t \r\nenjoyment. Although I had been widowed \t \r\nfor about 10 years, I had managed to raise \t \r\nall four of them on my own. Everything \t \r\nwas going well for us until that fateful \t \r\nMonday evening of December 31, 2007. \t \r\nThere was tension everywhere following \t \r\nclaims that the general election results \t \r\nhad been \u2018stolen\u2019. We expected anything \t \r\nto happen and the fear was intense. Sure \t \r\nenough, a group of men broke into the \t \r\ncompound of my house in Kariobangi. \t \r\nBefore I could collect my thoughts, they \t \r\nhad forced my door open. One of them hit \t \r\nme on the head before the rest subjected \t \r\nme to the kind of treatment we see on TV \t \r\nwhen a person is caught stealing. They \t \r\ncall it mob justice, except that I had done \t \r\nnothing wrong. \t \r\nAfter a few minutes of beating me \t \r\nalmost senseless, they dragged me several \t \r\nmetres from my house and did the worst \t \r\nthing that can happen to any woman \t \r\n\u2013 rape. I was gang-raped while my house \t \r\nwas cleaned of all my household goods. \t \r\nWhen they were through, they poured \t \r\nsomething on me. It was a cold liquid \t \r\nthat trickled down my body and caused \t \r\na tingling sensation. Then I heard one of \t \r\nthe men saying, \u201cKwa nini mumempiga \t \r\nna tulisema hatutawapiga wamama? \t \r\n(why have you beaten her when we all \t \r\nagreed not to beat the women?)\u201d Then \t \r\nthey all left. \t \r\nGreat pain \t \r\nI lay there in great pain and when I stood \t \r\nup several hours later, it was to discover a \t \r\nbig wound on my head and some bleeding \t \r\nfrom my private parts. I vowed not to \t \r\ntell anyone I had been raped lest I was \t \r\nsubjected to humiliation and ridicule. I \t \r\ncertainly didn\u2019t need that at this low point \t \r\nof my life. I was a very committed Christian \t \r\nwho led women in worship during church \t \r\nservices. I did not want those who knew \t \r\nme to start laughing at me for serving a \t \r\nGod who could not protect me from being \t \r\nraped and beaten almost to death. \t \r\nI could see my house burning but I did \t \r\nnot dare venture near it because I didn\u2019t \t \r\nknow what they had poured on me. I ran \t \r\noutside the gate and saw several fires lit \t \r\non the sides of the main road. I ran in the \t \r\nopposite direction towards the church, \t \r\nwhich was closed. I knew there was a tap \t \r\nbehind the church building so I jumped \t \r\nover the fence and made for the tap where \t \r\nI washed off as much of the liquid as I \t \r\ncould. I still remember how I felt at that \t \r\nmoment. God had betrayed me. \t \r\nI headed for a market stall nearby to \t \r\nhide in my fear and shame. When morning \t \r\ncame I was very weak. I had not eaten \t \r\nanything the previous night. The stall \t \r\nowner came and found me hiding and \t \r\nwhen I narrated my ordeal, she offered \t \r\nme some food and advised me to go to \t \r\na nearby hospital where a nurse dressed \t \r\nthe wound on my head. By this time, my \t \r\nhair had started falling off and I was bald \t \r\nin some places. My children were not at \t \r\nhome when the attackers struck \u2013 they had \t \r\ngone up-country to Bondo a week earlier.\r\nNow here I was all alone and with nowhere\r\nto call home. The stalls became my hideout\r\nand I stayed there a whole week, begging\r\nfrom the owners for survival. Some people\r\nthought I was a mad woman.\r\nOne morning I woke up feeling very\r\nsick. I was bald and my body had sores\r\nwherever the mysterious liquid had\r\nlanded. I did not know what else to do so\r\nI walked slowly to the Kariobangi police\r\npost. I found that many people had sought\r\nrefuge there. I found doctors there who\r\ntook me to Kenyatta National Hospital\r\nwhere I received treatment for the sores.\r\nI learnt they were as a result of acid \u2013 the\r\nliquid that was poured on me the night of\r\nthe attack.\r\nLife at the makeshift camp at the police\r\npost was far from rosy. I felt alone and\r\nrejected as people ran away from me\r\nbecause of the state I was in \u2013 pus oozed\r\nfrom my sores and no one would share a\r\ntent with me. If anyone gave me water to\r\ndrink, they threw away the cup.\r\nI lost all track of time as my life had\r\ncome to a standstill. I remember my 15-\r\nyear-old son arriving from up-country to\r\nsee me and saying it was February. I still\r\nremember him fainting at the sight of his\r\ndisheveled mother and the realisation\r\nthat we had lost everything we owned as\r\na family. My eldest daughter, aged 17, was\r\nin Form Three at the time and managed\r\nonly two terms before she was forced out\r\nof school for lack of fees.\r\nI was no longer running my business and\r\nhad eaten into my savings to buy medicine,\r\nso I couldn\u2019t help her. This aff ected me\r\npsychologically because I had determined\r\nto see that all my children went through\r\nschool. Instead, with me living at the camp\r\nand my daughter staying upcountry with\r\nmy two other daughters \u2013 aged 13 and 11\r\n\u2013 she got pregnant. She had a baby early\r\nthis year.\r\nAlthough I received treatment until the\r\nsores healed, I never confi ded in any of\r\nthe doctors about being raped until a few\r\nweeks ago when I started experiencing\r\na lot of discomfort when passing urine\r\nand a lot of pain in my lower abdomen.\r\nFortunately, tests revealed that I had not\r\ncontracted the HIV virus. My head is\r\nswollen from the blow I received but I have\r\nbeen unable to raise the money needed for\r\na head scan.\r\nMy relatives disowned me a long time\r\nago saying I had Aids and so there was\r\nno point in helping me get treatment\r\nbecause the disease has no cure. A brother\r\nof mine even said I should be taken home\r\n(upcountry) to die hence reduce funeral\r\nexpenses.\r\nI left the camp and found a small room\r\nI now call home in Kariobangi. It costs\r\nSh2,000 to rent; this is paid for by wellwishers\r\nfrom the church. I have not been\r\nable to visit the compound where my house\r\nonce stood, but I have heard that people\r\nhave erected stalls on it. A few months I\r\nwas diagnosed with hypertension; I wasn\u2019t\r\nreally surprised in view of what I\u2019ve been\r\nthrough. Needless to say I cannot aff ord\r\nthe medication.\r\nThere have been many times when I\u2019ve\r\nlost the will to live. But thoughts of my\r\nchildren keep me hanging on. I\u2019ve come\r\nto believe God wants me alive to tell what\r\nhappened even though it is very hard\r\nfor me to accept how much my life has\r\nchanged. It has been even more diffi cult\r\nfor my children to adjust, especially the\r\nyounger ones. Memories of our old life are\r\nmaking them ill. They can\u2019t understand\r\nthat we can\u2019t celebrate their birthdays the\r\nway we used to.\r\nAsthma attack\r\nThis thought alone has caused the lastborn\r\nto suff er asthma attacks. I thank God\r\nfor the support from their teachers and\r\nothers around them to help them come\r\nto terms with our loss. One well-wisher\r\neven helped my son enroll in Form One\r\nthis year. I\u2019ll take the help for as long as\r\nit comes and worry about what happens\r\nnext later.\r\nI have heard a lot of talk about where\r\nthe perpetrators of the violence should\r\nbe tried. Justice for me means having\r\nthe people whose names are in the Waki\r\nEnvelope face trial at The Hague. It pains\r\nme deeply whenever I hear politicians on\r\nTV saying our local courts are as good as\r\nThe Hague. They don\u2019t know what they\u2019re\r\ntalking about. The Hague means a lot to\r\npeople like me.\r\nA local tribunal would not only be subject\r\nto manipulation by selfish individuals\r\ngiven the widening rifts between our\r\npoliticians owing to suspicion, but it could\r\nalso trigger anxiety among Kenyans given\r\nthat we identify our political leaders by\r\ntribe, which could draw us right back to\r\nwhere we were at the time of the elections.\r\nHelpless Kenyans like me feel justice can\r\nonly be served if these people are tried at\r\nThe Hague.\r\n\r\nmmwololo@nation.co.ke"}
