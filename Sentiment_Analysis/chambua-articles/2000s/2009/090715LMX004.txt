{"text": "\ufeffWEDNESDAY JULY 15, 2009\r\n\r\nHEALTH\r\n\r\nHOW MEDICATION AFFECTS YOUR TEETH\r\n\r\nAdverse reactions to medication\r\nhave been known to spread to\r\nother parts of the body, including\r\nthe teeth. These side effects include\r\ndiscolouration, sensitivity and damaged\r\ntooth structures.\r\nFluoride from sources such as water,\r\ntoothpaste and prescribed tablets has\r\nlong been recognised for its potential to\r\ncause tooth discolouration or damage,\r\nmore so when the hard outer tooth\r\ncovering is undergoing formation and\r\nmaturation. This is especially true when\r\nthe intake of fluoride is high. At a lower\r\nintake, the magnitude and severity of\r\ndecay is significantly reduced.\r\nSome antibiotics, such as\r\ntetracycline can cause discolouration of\r\ntooth enamel when prescribed during\r\ntooth development. Women exposed to\r\nsuch drugs during the second or third\r\ntrimester of pregnancy may deliver\r\nbabies who will have discoloured teeth.\r\nSince mineralisation of the permanent\r\nteeth is not complete until a child is\r\neight years old, such drugs should not\r\nbe used by anyone under that age.\r\nSome types of mouthwash\r\nliquids, oral iron salts in liquid form\r\nand essential oils may also cause\r\ndiscolouration. Any sugar-containing\r\n(liquid) medication has the potential\r\nto cause an increased incidence of\r\ndental cavities, especially in children.\r\nWherever possible, get sugar-free\r\nmedications.\r\nSome drugs can cause regurgitation\r\nof food from the stomach, resulting\r\nin gastric acid in the mouth and a\r\nsubsequent increased risk for tooth\r\nerosion. Drugs such as aspirin and\r\nsome mouth wash preparations also\r\nhave the potential to cause erosion.\r\nPowdered forms of anti-asthma\r\ndrugs are acidic, thus posing a risk for\r\nerosion.\r\nThere are medications that cause\r\na dry mouth, which can result in\r\ndamaged teeth. Decongestants and\r\ncold cures, stomach ulcer solutions,\r\nHIV and Aids treatments and\r\nantidepressants can cause dryness\r\nof the mouth. And some medications\r\nused to treat childhood cancers such as\r\nleaukemia may lead to abnormal dental\r\ndevelopment. The severity of this is\r\nrelated to the age of the child, the\r\ndosage and the duration of treatment.\r\nDental abnormalities associated with\r\ncancer medications include missing\r\nteeth, arrested tooth development and\r\nteeth appearing smaller than normal.\r\nSome drugs may have adverse effects\r\non other areas of the mouth, including\r\naltered taste, ulceration and swelling of\r\nthe gums.\r\nDr Kamau Kinyenje\r\npointofcare@africaonline"}
