{"text": "\ufeffSunday Nation August 30, 2009\r\n\r\nPeople with Aids become very ill and die of an illness that people can avoid.\t\r\nI know a lady who had a big shop. When people\tfound out that she and her husband were\r\nHIV positive, they stopped going to her shop a\tnd started gossiping about her. They even\t\r\nrefused to greet her. She felt bad but her hus\tband told her to be strong even without friends\r\nGod would take care of her and she changed and\tturned to God for friendship.\r\n\r\nCarol Karimi, 12, Moi Academy, Thika\t"}
