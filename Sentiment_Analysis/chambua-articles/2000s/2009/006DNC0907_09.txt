People with HIV take
drugs fi ght to court

Group says new
law denies them
right to cheap
medication

BY JIJO KANINO
group of people living
with Aids took the
fi ght for their lives to
court challenging a
law they say denies them access
to life-saving drugs.
They say the Anti-Counterfeit
Act will interfere with
the importation and sale of
generic drugs in so far as the
medication may be considered
counterfeit.
This, they said, would deny
them the highest attainable
right to life as the cost of drugs
might be beyond their reach.
Most of the country’s more
than 1.4 million people living
with HIV and Aids rely on fi rst
line generic anti-retroviral
drugs, namely 3TC (lamivudine),
AZT (Zidovudine) and
NVP (Nevirapine).
In suit papers fi led through
lawyer David Majanja, the
group raised concern at particular
sections of the Act
which they believe will endanger
their well-being.
They say sections 2, 32 and 34
will deny them access to drugs
necessary for the fulfi lment of
the quality of life they are guaranteed
under the Constitution.
The Act was passed in December
2008 but has not been
enacted.
Critics say the government is
under pressure from big business
to quickly enact it.
According to the group, the
Act fails to acknowledge and
specifically exempt generic
drugs from the definition of
counterfeit goods.
Its failure to provide a clear
defi nition of counterfeit goods
eff ectively prohibits importation
and manufacture of generic
drugs in the country.
They are apprehensive that
once the law is enacted, generic
drugs will be deemed counterfeit,
putting thousands of HIV
patients at risk.
Regular supply
One of them said that she had
lived with the virus for 19 years
and told the court how expensive
the drugs were when she
started buying them.
The unemployed woman said
she only started getting a regular
supply six years ago when she
joined the government-run Anti-
Retroviral Therapy Programme
which supplies generic drugs.
“I believe it is in my interest
and that of all living with HIV/
Aids to be protected from counterfeit
drugs but not all generic
drugs are counterfeit.”
Another woman said she had
lived with the virus for eight
years and that her fi ve-year-old
son is also infected.
