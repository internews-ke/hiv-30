{"text": "\ufeffDAILY NATION\r\nNOT WITCHCRAFT BUT HIV\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, some prefer to\r\nbelieve a positive test result has\r\nto do with the supernatural\r\n\r\nLIVING POSITIVELY\r\nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother of two who\r\ntested positive 20 years ago. She is the executive director of\r\nthe Kenya Network of Women with Aids (KENWA).\r\nWhen I tested HIV positive, I would have preferred to\r\nhear anything else but that I had been infected with a\r\nvirus associated with an immoral lifestyle. Had I been\r\ntold I was bewitched, I would have more readily accepted the\r\nverdict. It was the lesser of two evils.\r\nIn the early days of HIV, some people believed people living\r\nwith HIV were bewitched. That\u2019s because they didn\u2019t know how\r\nelse to explain this ogre except to fall back on what was more\r\nfamiliar to them. Such cases are now isolated thanks to the\r\nincreased level of awareness concerning this virus. As a result,\r\nmany people have come out of their ignorance cocoons.\r\nEven though I knew what was \u2018eating\u2019 me up back then,\r\nthere were times when my mind played tricks on me. I couldn\u2019t\r\nunderstand why, of all people, it had to be me infected with\r\nHIV. I thought there must be a human hand behind my\r\npredicament and I nearly lost my mind. Something like this had\r\nnever happened in our family. In fact, I was the first person to\r\nbe HIV infected where we lived and people came from far and\r\nwide to see me, although they kept a safe distance.\r\nNo support groups\r\nThe fact that there were no support groups then didn\u2019t make\r\nthings any easier. The churches treated people living with\r\nHIV like modern day lepers. Feeling they had no other option,\r\nsome of my friends ran to witchdoctors, who took advantage\r\nof them. These were desperate folks, and because of the ill\r\ntreatment they had received from society, they preferred to\r\nswallow whatever a witchdoctor told them. But it turned out\r\nthat what they thought was light at the end of the tunnel was\r\nactually the headlights of a fast-approaching train.\r\nI thank God that in the nick of time I met people who were\r\nliving positively, otherwise I would be a statistic by now.\r\nBecause when one starts saying they\u2019re bewitched \u2013 yet there\u2019s\r\nan HIV test to prove otherwise \u2013 they are standing on the edge\r\nof a cliff and a small gust of wind is enough to push them to\r\ntheir deaths.\r\nA reader recently wrote to me detailing her predicament\r\nand asking me for help. She\u2019s the eldest of three children and\r\ntheir mother tested HIV-positive in early 2007. She said their\r\nworld turned upside down, first as her mother refused to take\r\nlife-prolonging antiretroviral drugs once she learnt her CD4\r\ncount was low. Fortunately, later in the year she started taking\r\nthe drugs. Although she was born and baptised a Catholic, she\r\nbecame a member of another church after testing positive.\r\nThen her new church convinced her that she had been\r\nbewitched.\r\n\u201cNow our mother doesn\u2019t get along with anyone, not even\r\nher own mother,\u201d the girl said. \u201cShe reads Bible verses and\r\ntries to convince anyone willing to listen that she has been\r\nbewitched by me, my aunts, my grandma, anybody. I look at\r\nher and wonder what happened to the mother who was always\r\nhappy and outgoing. I wish God would change things for us.\u201d\r\nRight information\r\nWhen someone living with HIV starts saying they\u2019re bewitched\r\n\u2013 and they keep saying it no matter what \u2013 it means they need\r\nhelp. It means they\u2019ve been misinformed and need to get the\r\nright information. If we are to win this war, we have to tell\r\npeople the truth. We must tell them that HIV infection doesn\u2019t\r\nmean death.\r\nWe have to tell them that there\u2019s life after sero-conversion;\r\nthat this condition can be managed and allow one to go on\r\nwith one\u2019s life. I am a witness, after all. I too, once stood on\r\nthe precipice and had a choice to believe what my friends\r\nwho were living positively told me, or that my situation had\r\nsomething to do with witchcraft.\r\nIt\u2019s very easy to go with whatever is convenient, whatever\r\nhas less stress and stigma attached to it. The tag of HIV\r\npositive _______ (put your name in the space) does that to\r\nsome, especially if there is no firm foundation based on sound\r\nknowledge. The label makes one want to run and hide from the\r\ntruth, because this particular truth is \u2018dirty\u2019 and it hurts.\r\nI don\u2019t know whether witchcraft exists or not, but I do\r\nknow HIV exists, although I can\u2019t get into the whole science\r\nbehind it. I believe what the researchers and doctors tell me\r\nbecause their methodologies are concrete and follow laid\r\ndown international guidelines. Knowing and accepting the\r\ntruth has set me free: free to live and experience the wondrous\r\nopportunities life has in store for me.\r\nasuntawagura@hotmail.com\r\nNot witchcraft but HIV"}
