Police probe theft
at Vigilance House

CONTINUED FROM PAGE 1
gations beyond the theft, to
include the purchase and
installation of the CCTV system
and other tenders that
altogether total to Sh800
million. Offi cers close to the
investigation led by the CID
told the Nation that Vigilance
House may have been fi tted
with “dummy surveillance
equipment,” and the millions
of shillings meant for the genuine
one embezzled.
At least six senior offi cers,
from the personnel, logistics
and procurement departments
have been questioned.
The investigations team is
led by senior assistant commissioner
of police Gideon
Kimilu.
The detectives have dusted
the store for finger prints,
and those being investigated
had their prints taken.
While the drugs were stolen,
the doors and locks remained
intact, suggesting
the thieves used keys to gain
entry.
Offi cers privy to the investigation,
but who requested
not to be named, said Maj
Gen Ali was shocked to hear
that the anti-retroviral drugs
had been stolen from the
store on the ground fl oor of
Vigilance House on Nairobi’s
Harambee Avenue.
The police chief was further
angered when informed that
the CCTV system had failed
shortly after installation, and
yet no one had bothered to
fi le a report or take up the
issue with the suppliers.
The investigations so far
reveal that what was thought
to be a state-of-the-art system
was actually a fake, and also
procured at a price way above
the real value for a functioning
system.
Aids scourge
Junior offi cers stationed at
the monitoring room have
also been questioned to establish
why the breakdown
was not reported.
The drugs stolen were for
the treatment of police offi cers
who are HIV positive.
Procurement and distribution
of the drugs is part
of a programme initiated to
reduce casualties of the HIV/
Aids scourge among the police
staff .
A fully-fledged department
on the programme has
been established at Vigilance
House to co-ordinate the
anti-Aids campaign, and is
headed by a senior assistant
commissioner of police.
