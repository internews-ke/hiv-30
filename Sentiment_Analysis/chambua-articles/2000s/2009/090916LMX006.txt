{"text": "\ufeffDAILY NATION\r\nWEDNESDAY SEPTEMBER 16, 2009\r\n\r\nLIVING POSITIVELY\r\nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother of two\r\nwho tested positive 20 years ago. She is the executive\r\ndirector of the Kenya Network of Women with Aids\r\n(KENWA).\r\nRecalling how Peter\r\ncame into my life\r\nToday is my son Peter\u2019s 19th birthday. Before that\r\nfateful Sunday when Peter came into my life, I had\r\na series of terrible heartbreaks. Six months after I\r\nhadn\u2019t died within the \u201cgrace period\u201d, I went to confront\r\nJimmy, my boyfriend (and first love) who infected me\r\nwith HIV. It wasn\u2019t hard to find him. He sensed that I had\r\na burning issue, so, after lukewarm greetings, we silently\r\nheaded for the caf\u00e9 where we used to meet as lovers.\r\n\u201cWhy did you give me Aids?\u201d I snapped. \u201cWhy did you\r\nsentence me to death? Why did you do this to me?\u201d He\r\nlooked at me in manner to suggest that I had only myself\r\nto blame.\r\n\u201cWhat exactly do you mean?\u201d\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re killing me with Aids, and I\u2019m not going\r\nanywhere. I\u2019ll follow you and die in your hands so you can\r\nbear the burden of burying me. Nobody wants me.\u201d With\r\nthat, we left for his two-bedroom house.\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand women,\u201d he told me that night as\r\nhe cuddled me. \u201cYou come out of the blue and accuse me\r\nof having given you Aids? If I had given you Aids, wouldn\u2019t\r\nI have died within six months? And, surely, do I look like\r\nsomeone who has Aids?\u201d\r\nI swallowed his bait line, hook and sinker. Before I\r\nanswered, he showered me with hot kisses all over and we\r\ngot intimate. I forgot all about Aids and dying. One thing\r\nled to another and by midnight, he was swearing how\r\nbadly he\u2019d missed me. \u201cForget about the matron and her\r\nAids,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019ll consider giving me a child, I\u2019ll take\r\nyou to college.\u201d\r\nWith that promiseabout college, my heart melted. But\r\nour happiness was short-lived. A couple of months after\r\nI conceived and went to the ante-natal clinic, my HIVpositive\r\nstatus was reconfirmed. \u201cHe\u2019ll \u2018see\u2019 me,\u201d I swore.\r\nBut this time he was well-prepared. \u201cYou were told you\u2019re\r\nHIV-infected. What did you expect? You thought by staying\r\nand sleeping with me the virus would be wiped out? If you\r\nwant to abort, here\u2019s 10,000 shillings. And if you don\u2019t\r\nwant to live with me, you can quit.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to \u2018quit\u2019,\r\nbecause, where would I go? Sad, but I still needed the devil.\r\nThe next morning, I tried to mend fences because, in my\r\nview, the buck stopped with me. So I agreed that we\u2019d go\r\nto Eastleigh and get rid of the baby. At the clinic, which\r\nsmelt of death, we found three other depressed clients\r\nwaiting to procure abortions.\r\n\u201cIs this the same Jimmy who promised to take me to\r\ncollege if I carried his child?\u201d I kept wondering, but I didn\u2019t\r\ndare ask lest I \u2018messed up\u2019 again. \u201cMeet me in town after\r\nyou\u2019ve \u2018finished with the small procedure\u2019,\u201d he told me\r\nimpatiently.\r\nAs I awaited my turn, I chewed the cud. \u201cSuppose I\r\nsurvive HIV, and because of what I\u2019m about to do I fail\r\nto conceive another baby, how will I face the world?\u201d I\r\nthought. I signalled the client behind me to go in and I\r\nchanged my mind.\r\nI left the clinic and headed straight to River Road, where\r\nI bought baby clothes with the money he\u2019d given me. \u201cHe\u2019ll\r\nunderstand that I made a wise decision,\u201d I reasoned.\r\n\u201cI know women are strange, but you\u2019re the strangest,\u201d\r\nJimmy remarked when I told him what I\u2019d done. \u201cI can see\r\nthis relationship isn\u2019t going to work.\u201d\r\n\u201cHe\u2019ll cool off by morning,\u201d I thought. But in the\r\nmorning, Jimmy left for work earlier than usual and left me\r\nin bed. When I got up, I realised that he had carried most\r\nof his belongings.\r\nCome delivery day, I went to the nearest public hospital.\r\nI had carried the ante-natal clinic card, which proved\r\nto be my undoing. The nurses at the labour ward read\r\nmy positive serostatusand abandoned me. None of them\r\nwould come near me, so I screamed and cursed until\r\n3 a.m. when my son was born. He arrived with what I\r\nneeded most; a season of renewal. I would bear pain and\r\nridicule because of him. As I wrapped him with my khanga,\r\nI felt some inner peace and healing. I even forgot that I\r\nhad Aids.\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll forgive them and move on as long as nothing can\r\ntake my Peter away. I just don\u2019t care \u2026 I must live,\u201d I swore.\r\nIt\u2019s 19 years since that day. Peter changed my attitude\r\ntowards life and my view of HIV. And I decided I\u2019d live, even\r\nif only for him.\r\nHappy birthday, Peter.\r\nMy son changed my attitude\r\ntowards life and my view of HIV"}
