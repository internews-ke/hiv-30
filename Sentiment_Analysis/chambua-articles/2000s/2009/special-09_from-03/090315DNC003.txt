Her reason? A conversation\r\nshe was able to overhear because of\r\nthe thin iron-sheet walls of her home has\r\nrenewed her hope in breaking free of the\r\nshackles of poverty.\r\nAfter her father died from Aids and with\r\nher mother in poor health, Ms Kweyu had\r\ngiven up on ever receiving a post-primary\r\neducation. But one evening while preparing\r\nsupper, she overheard her neighbours\r\ndiscussing St Aloysius Gonzaga School \u2013 a\r\nfee-free Catholic secondary school in Kibera,\r\nwhich fi rst opened its doors for education\r\nin 2004.\r\nIn the morning, she looked for the\r\nschool, sought to speak to the school\r\nprincipal, Mr Dionisio Kiambi, and got\r\nenrolled. \u201cIf it were not for St Aloysius\r\nSchool, I would be working as a day labourer,\r\nhouse-cleaning and doing laundry.\r\nI would not have this bright future ahead\r\nof me,\u201d she said.\r\nWork of mercy\r\nThe school is named after a young 17th\r\ncentury Jesuit saint who put his theological\r\nstudies on hold to care for plague victims\r\nin Rome; a work of mercy that led\r\nto his death. In recognition of his care for\r\npeople who suff er from a dreaded disease,\r\nSt Aloysius was declared the patron saint\r\nof Aids victims and their carers.\r\nThe school arose from the work of members\r\nof Christian Life Community (CLC),\r\na Catholic lay movement that visits people\r\nsuff ering from Aids in Kibera. They\r\nobserved that people living with HIV expressed\r\ngrave concern for their children\u2019s\r\nfuture and especially their education.\r\nIn 2003, in response to this concern,\r\nCLC sponsored the fi rst 12 Aids-aff ected\r\nchildren to attend secondary school. Before\r\nthe year ended, the leaders of CLC\r\nalong with their Jesuit chaplain, Father\r\nTerry Charlton, decided to start their own\r\nfee-free secondary school for Aids-aff ected\r\nyouth. It would propagate an education\r\nthat would produce \u201cmen and women for\r\nothers\u201d.\r\nToday, this school of 265 students has\r\nambitious plans to build a permanent\r\nschool in May 2009, which would eventually\r\nserve 420 students.\r\nAs well as providing students with daily\r\nbreakfast and lunch, the school also pays\r\ntheir school fees, and buys their books\r\nand writing materials. It also has a special\r\nbudget to assist students to buy school\r\nuniform.\r\nDespite the myriad problems Aids-affected\r\nstudents living in Kibera face,\r\nenthusiasm\r\nand humour abound among\r\nthem. It is remarkable to meet young people\r\nwho have every reason to be hopeless\r\nyet instead focus on their plans and hopes\r\nfor a brighter future.\r\nLife skills\r\nMs Jill Juma, a biology and chemistry\r\nteacher at St Aloysius, says, \u201cI go beyond\r\njust being a science teacher. I want to\r\nteach life skills and empower young lives.\r\nProviding a free education is lifting the\r\nburden of poverty for families.\u201d\r\n\u201cThis is the school of hope,\u201d enthused\r\nAtieno Perez Okomo, a grateful Form 4\r\nstudent. \u201cThe teachers at St Al\u2019s really\r\ncare for us and they give us hope for a better\r\nfuture.\u201d"}
