{"text": "\ufeffWEDNESDAY MAY 27, 2009\r\n\r\nMAKING A CASE FOR BREASTFEEDING\r\nWhat every new mother needs to know about it. \r\n\r\nBy DOROTHY KWEYU\r\n\r\nThree of my children breastfed\r\nexclusively for four months and\r\ntwo of them continued even\r\nafter weaning for up to threeand-\r\na-half years. However, I am\r\nnot accusing any mother of failing to take\r\nadvantage of the natural resource that\r\nis breast milk. I was only able to achieve\r\nthis after Unicef and the World Health\r\nOrganisation launched the 1983 Code of\r\nMarketing of Breast Milk Substitutes. The\r\ncode sought to lock out infant formula\r\nmanufacturers from maternity wards and\r\nother health facilities.\r\nBefore that, many mothers, myself\r\nincluded, were caught up in the infant\r\nformula manufacturers\u2019 aggressive\r\nmarketing campaigns that saw breast milk\r\nsubstitute gift packs given to them as they\r\nleft maternity wards. The strategy killed\r\nmany mothers\u2019 urge to breastfeed.\r\nThe decade after WHO/Unicef\u2019s launch\r\nof the code saw an unprecedented surge\r\nin breastfeeding. No wonder my last three\r\nchildren benefi tted from a prolonged\r\nbreast milk diet.\r\nThen scientifi c evidence began to show\r\nthat breastfed babies could contract\r\nAids from their HIV-positive mothers. It\r\nstruck a body blow to mothers who were\r\nfrightened by the possibility of infecting\r\ntheir babies.\r\nMany mothers wish to breastfeed their\r\nbabies but are hampered by a host of\r\nreasons, including fear that they do not\r\nhave enough milk or that breastfeeding\r\nis agony. The truth is any mother who\r\nhas given birth successfully can initiate\r\nbreastfeeding if she is helped to latch the\r\nbaby onto the breast immediately.\r\nBabies are born with an instinct for\r\nsurvival and will latch onto the breast with\r\nabandon. It is the process of suckling that\r\ntriggers \u2018let down\u2019 \u2013 the mechanism that\r\ncauses milk to fl ow into the milk ducts\r\nthat are located just above the nipple.\r\nFor fi rst-time mums, the fi rst attempt\r\nat breastfeeding can be an excruciating\r\nexperience. Support from a nurse, an\r\nexperienced relative or friend becomes a\r\nblessing.\r\nSheri Bayles, a registered nurse\r\nwith more than 20 years\u2019 experience\r\ndismisses the notion in some books that\r\nif breastfeeding hurts, you\u2019re doing it\r\nwrong. \u201cThat is actually incorrect. Most\r\nwomen experience some discomfort, if not\r\noutright pain when they fi rst latch a baby\r\non\u2026 However, within a couple of minutes,\r\nit should become tolerable. If it is tolerable,\r\nit is correct. If it is still excruciating, relatch\r\nthe baby,\u201d she says, adding that most\r\nsoreness dissipates within two weeks.\r\nSuccessful breastfeeding is based on the\r\nprinciple that emptying causes refi lling; so\r\nthe more the baby breastfeeds, the more\r\nthe milk fl ows. To minimise the pain on\r\nthe breast, ensure that the baby\u2019s mouth\r\ncovers both the nipple and the areola\r\n(the small circular dark area around the\r\nnipple) since you are likely to suff er more\r\npain if the baby suckles at the nipple.\r\nWhen this happens, the baby will not get\r\nany milk, causing both you and your baby\r\nfrustration.\r\nMedical research has shown that breast\r\nmilk has all the nutrients a baby needs.\r\nIndeed, the baby can survive on exclusive\r\nbreastfeeding for four-to-six months.\r\nDuring this time, he is also building\r\nimmunity because the mother passes on\r\nher immunity to him.\r\nAn exclusively breastfed baby is unlikely\r\nto suff er from constipation. If your baby\r\nis calm after breastfeeding and is gaining\r\nweight at each well-baby clinic, there\r\nshould be no pressure to go for breast milk\r\nsubstitutes.\r\nFeeding bottles have been linked to\r\ndiarrhoea and vomiting, which can kill a\r\nbaby within 24 hours. The good old cup\r\nis usually the best way to wean the baby\r\nfrom the breast. It is easier to ensure the\r\ncleanliness of a cup than a bottle. While\r\nmost babies will initially resist anything\r\nother than Mum\u2019s warm breast, they\r\nquickly learn to drink milk from a cup\r\n(some mothers use a cup and spoon).\r\nIdeally, nursing mothers should be given\r\nat least six months to breastfeed. Since\r\nit is diffi cult for working mothers to get\r\nsuch extended periods away from their\r\nemployers, the best strategy is to express\r\nbreast milk and leave it at home with the\r\nperson caring for the baby. Breast milk can\r\nremain fresh at room temperature for at\r\nleast 24 hours; it can also be refrigerated.\r\nHowever, there are situations when\r\nbreastfeeding may be diffi cult. A mother\r\nwho is heavily medicated, or who has had\r\na Caesarean section delivery needs special\r\nsupport to breastfeed. And a good doctor\r\nwill normally ask if you are nursing before\r\nprescribing certain drugs.\r\nA premature baby of less than 36 weeks\r\ngestation is incapable of latching onto the\r\nbreast and mothers should be taught to\r\nexpress so that the baby can be tube-fed.\r\nIt is important to avoid mastitis when\r\nyou are breastfeeding. This is likely to\r\noccur if the baby is not emptying the\r\nbreast. Mastitis is a bacterial infection that\r\noccurs when milk remains in the ducts,\r\nclogging them and causing infl ammation.\r\nIf you feel feverish with painful swelling\r\nof the breast that is hot to touch, seek\r\nmedical attention at once. Unattended\r\nmastitis can lead to an abscess, which is\r\nthe build-up of pus.\r\nIf you have baby who is a lazy feeder\r\n\u2013 one who falls asleep before emptying the\r\nbreast \u2013 it is wise to express the milk and\r\nstore it for cup feeding.\r\ndkweyu@nation.co.ke"}
