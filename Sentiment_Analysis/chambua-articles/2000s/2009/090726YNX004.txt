I lost my parent when I was in Class\r\nTwo to a monster called Aids. We were wealthy\r\nbut now I often sleep on an empty stomach. When\r\nI was in Class Six, I became sickly, always in and\r\nout of hospital. I fi nally got tested for HIV and to\r\nmy shock I was positive. I tried committing suicide\r\nbut it did not work. This has aff ected my grades.\r\nAlthough my aim is get an A- in KCSE, I doubt I will\r\nmake it because currently my average is D-. But I\r\nhave many friends including nuns, priests, doctors\r\nand nurses but I always lie to them I do very well\r\nin school. I don\u2019t want to continue lying and my\r\ndream is to be a lawyer in future. I am confused\r\nand stressed. I feel like taking a stronger poison so\r\nthat I can end all my problems.\r\nOchieng\u2019\r\nKisumu\r\nDear Ochieng\u2019,\r\nYou must remember that God is the Giver of life\r\nand He is the only one who can take it. Besides,\r\nthere are better ways of fi nding solutions to\r\nproblems than attempting to commit suicide. I\r\nmust admit I like your determination to change\r\nyour life for better. You must hang on to this\r\nbecause things will certainly be better.\r\nWhat you lack probably is someone to guide you.\r\nThe advantage you have is that you mentioned\r\npeople in your circle of friends who are actually\r\ngood role models to you and who can help you\r\nfocus better. You probably haven\u2019t told them the\r\nwhole truth about what you are going through. You\r\nshould, for instance, stop lying about your grades\r\nbecause then all looks ok to them. You should also\r\ntell them about your HIV status in case they are not\r\naware. This you should do immediately and they\r\nare likely to help you.\r\nOf course it\u2019s too much to lose your parent at an\r\nearly age and later to discover you are HIV positive.\r\nThis could be the reason you are stressed and this\r\nis aff ecting your performance in class. What you\r\nshould remember is that being HIV positive is not\r\na death sentence. Today there are life-prolonging\r\ndrugs and you can live a healthy life for long. I\r\nbelieve your friends will be kind enough to help\r\nyou access the medication and to pass your exams\r\nto achieve your dream of becoming a lawyer. All\r\nthe best Ochieng\u2019.\r\nMy mother favours my\r\nyounger brother\r\nDear Auntie Liz,\r\nI got a problem with my mother. When my\r\nyounger brother asks for something, my mother\r\ngets him. When I ask for anything, she keeps\r\nquiet and doesn\u2019t even bother to explain why\r\nshe can\u2019t give what I ask for. I feel she favours\r\nmy brother. I want to run away from home and\r\nleave the two of them. Please help.\r\nGachiri,\r\nThika\r\nDear Gachiri,\r\nYou are likely to be feeling unloved and\r\nunappreciated by your mother because she doesn\u2019t\r\ngive you what you ask for. You may want her to\r\ntreat you fairly or at least the same way she treats\r\nyour younger brother. The best way to handle this\r\nsituation is through communication. Unless you\r\nsit down with your mother and explain to her how\r\nyou feel, you are unlikely to change things. And\r\nrunning away from home won\u2019t help matters. You\r\nwill always feel that she treats your brother better\r\nand loves him more.\r\nYou need to talk to her calmly and in a mature\r\nway. Explain to her that you do not necessarily\r\nwant to be favoured but rather to be treated well.\r\nShow her that you appreciate the things she has\r\ndone for you already like caring for you. Explain\r\nto her politely that you feel she is giving your\r\nyounger brother more attention and you feel lonely\r\nand unloved. Most likely, she is not aware of your\r\nfeelings but if she has a reason for paying more\r\nattention to your brother, she will explain it to you.\r\nYou will surely get to understand her actions when\r\nyou communicate. Also, remember that parents\r\ntend to give more attention to younger children.\r\nThey tend to spoil them and they get away with\r\nthings that they would punish you for simply\r\nbecause being older, they expect you to set a good\r\nexample to the others.\r\nEmail your questions to yn@nation.co.ke\r\nor egitonga@nation.co.ke\r\nOr send to Auntie Liz, Young Nation,\r\nBox 49010, 00100, Nairobi"}
