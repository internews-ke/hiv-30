Although the mobile money
phenomenon is still young,
the World Bank in Africa has
labeled it a “cornerstone for
development” because of its
potential to mobilise remote
rural economies. Already
mobile phones have transformed
the lives of people in
developing countries hence
the mobile money service
could have an even bigger
impact on these people and
their small businesses.
By using mobile money
services, millions are breaking
a technology barrier that
remains in Europe and the
United States, and paving
way to what could be the
cash of the future.
Mobile phones have
evolved in a few years to
become tools of economic
em powerment.These phones
compensate for inadequate
in frastructure, such as bad
roads and slow postal services,
allowing information to
move more freely, making
markets more efficient and
unleashing entrepreneurship.
According to Mr Elly Kamugisha,
a trade and development
expert, with mobile
phones now so common
placed, a new opportunity
has been created for
entrepreneurs especially in
the SME sector to thrive via
mobile money, which allows
cash to travel as quickly as a
text message.
Entrepreneurs and development
organisations are
eagerly seizing the opportunity
presented by such
growth. They are creating
mobile phone applications
for profitable and nonprofit
ventures across the board.
Since mobile money transfer
was launched in Uganda
months ago, millions of
people have embraced the
innovation to better their businesses.
Among the many businesspeople
who have taken advantage
of the rapid telecom technological
advancements to
improve the efficiency in business
running, is Mr Charles
Mubiru a businessman dealing
in fruits and groundnuts at
Nakasero market. He buys
all his fresh supplies upcountry
and sometimes as far as
Kenya.
His business is five years old
and Mr Mubiru says it (his
business) is set for a revolution
given the boost the business
community has received
from telecommunication companies,
after the introduction
of Money Transfer services.
“I no longer need to carry
money in the pocket or line
up in banking halls to make
transactions,” he says.
“A phone dial is enough for
me to transfer money to my
upcountry agents who buy the
fruits. I also pay my transporters
through the phone.”
To make his business more
efficient Mr Mubiru operates
both MTN and Safaricom mobile
money transfer services.
“I use the two services because
my suppliers in Kenya
might need money urgently,
which I have to send on time
or my goods especially apples
which are on high demand
will be sold to my competitor
who has ready cash,” he
explains.
Mr Mubiru reloads his Safaricom
Mpesa account every
one week within Kampala
or whenever he travels to
Nairobi for his goods. He says
that he cannot use the MTN
account to pay his Kenyan
suppliers because it is yet
to start working across the
border.
The service has proven to be
important and people particularly
from the busi
Mobile phones have evolved in
a few years to become tools of
economic em powerment.These
phones compensate for inadequate
in frastructure, such as bad
roads and slow postal services,
allowing information to move
more freely, making markets
more efficient and unleashing
entrepreneurship.
A businessman dealing in matooke
in Kampala for example,
will have no need of travelling to
the countryside to buy matooke.
The only thing he needs is to
use a phone to send money to an
agent who can do that (buying)
for him. This makes the product
safe in this era when accidents
and theft are rampant making
travelling with loads of money
risky.
MTN Publicist,
Ms Sheila Kangwagye
says the
Mobile Money
system is efficient
in its self,
and that is why
it can manage to
make transactions “in real time.”
“It has a self audit system to
track every single transaction,”
“Carrying out a transaction
should take you under three minutes
assuming you have money
on your account, however, the
Mobile Money platform is dependent
on SMS and the network
in general, so any interference in
that area may affect its performance.”
Not only is the service fast,
cheap and efficient, there is no
limit in the number of transactions
that need to be executed in
a day.
Mr Moses Kalungi, an MTN
service agent along Kampala
Road says that the service that is
hardly half a yearold
and it has
registered success. He however
says instances of network
breakdown at times compel
clients to wait for a little longer
before making their transactions.
To make business even
simpler and more effective,
plans are underway to turn
mobile money into a global
venture.
As MTN’s Marketing
Manager, Mr Isaac Nsereko
revealed this development will
only serve to widen the mobile
money transfer market and also
boost MTN’s presence in the
market.
It is a faster, cheaper and safer
way to transfer money than
the alternatives, such as slow,
costly transfers via banks and
post offices, or handing an envelope
of cash to a bus driver. Rather
than spend a day travelling by bus
to the nearest bank, recipients in
rural areas can spend their time
doing other things that add to their
productivity. Mobile money also
provides a stepping stone to formal
fi nancial services for people who
lack access to savings accounts,
credit and insurance. Although for
regula tory reasons mobile money
accounts do not pay interest, the
service is used by some people as a
savings account.
Having even a small cushion
of savings to fall back on allows
people to deal with unexpected expenses,
such as medical treatment,
with out having to sell a cow or
take a child out of school. Mobile
banking is safer than storing wealth
in the form of cattle (which can
become diseased and die), in neighbourhoods
savings schemes (which
may be fraud ulent) or by stuffing
banknotes into a mattress.
Mobile money presents a shining
opportunity to start a sec ond wave
of mobileled
development across
the developing world. Operators,
banks and regulators should
seize it.
According to Ms Winfrey
Katto, a Zain agent in Wandegeya,
carrying out a transaction
comes with a cost depending on
the amount one intends to send or
withdraw.
“Though we charge a fee for all
transaction, many clients don’t
mind because it is cheaper than
using banking services,” Ms
Katto explainsd
“Mobile handsets are in an
excellent position to become
the primary digital channel for
providers of banking and related
financial services in emerging
markets,” Mr Kamugisha says.
The scope of the mobile money
systems has grown quickly from
simple cash transfers by text message
to payments for everything
from a salon visit to a utility bill,
and it is possible to spend a day
without carrying cash around.
Beyond simple profit, Mr Yesse
Oenga, the Zain Uganda Managing
Director says the real value of
mobile cash to phone firms lies in
securing a longterm
connection
with customers as cutthroat
competition in the mobile
market eats into revenues.
“We see it as a tool to create
stickiness,” Mr Oenga says.
“Yes, it’s a revenue service
but at the cost of an SMS,
you’re not going to get rich
quickly.”
The service has also allowed
money to penetrate more easily
into rural areas where it’s
really needed.
Ms Gemima Namubiru is
someone whose life has become
much more manageable
because of mobile money.
She is 70years
old and
somehow manages to maintain
her small family farm in
Mbarara.
Like other people living off
the land and a small number
of livestock, she is dependent
on money earned by a close
relative, far away in an urban
centre.
A weekly SMS message
from her daughter in Kampala
negates what she used
to experience long
delays
and sometimes the non arrival
of cash brought by relatives,
friends or informal couriers.
Ms Namubiru is not in top
form health but she can use
her mobile phone walk to
the nearest trading centre to
cash in her SMS transfers at
the local shop which acts as
an agent for the service. Back
in Kampala, her daughter,
Irene, works as a lowly paid
voluntary assistant for a HIVAids
clinic and is relieved not
to face the trouble and cost
of the threehour
weekly bus
journey to her mother’s home.
“I used to send money with
friends or relatives or sometimes
anyone who I thought
would be reliable,” she said.
“But so often, money used to
get stolen or lost.”
