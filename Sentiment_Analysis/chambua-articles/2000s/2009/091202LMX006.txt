{"text": "\ufeffDAILY NATION Wednesday December 2, 2009\r\n\r\nWaiting for the results for Peter\u2019s\r\nHIV test was a real nightmare\r\n\r\nLIVING POSITIVELY\r\nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother of two who\r\ntested positive 20 years ago. She is the executive director\r\nof the Kenya Network of Women with Aids (KENWA).\r\nThe longest emotional\r\njourney of my life\r\nAfter being rejected by several schools, Peter finally\r\nfound one with a more accommodating headmistress.\r\nI was at peace; at least nobody in the school was\r\nbothered about our HIV status. But I still hated the nosy\r\nneighbours who kept making insinuations about Peter\u2019s HIV\r\nstatus. And for some years I buried my head in the sand like\r\nan ostrich, hoping my son was HIV-negative.\r\nI hadn\u2019t had Peter tested, and I didn\u2019t have the courage\r\nto do it. I simply hoped that God had spared him the HIV\r\ninfection. But my faith and hope were stretched to the limit\r\nafter he did his Standard Eight exams and was due for\r\ncircumcision, as is the custom in my community.\r\n\u201cWhen are you going to organise Peter\u2019s tea?\u201d women\r\nfrom my village started asking, which is a polite way of\r\nasking when a boy will \u201cface the knife\u201d.\r\nUnknown to them, the subject freaked me out. Peter\r\nwasn\u2019t mine alone anymore. I wished I had the sole right\r\nto Peter because I would have said a straight \u201cno\u201d but the\r\npressure was piling, and I needed the courage to face up to\r\nmy worst fear.\r\n\u201cI\u2019m caught between a rock and a hard place,\u201d I confided\r\nin a good friend. \u201cAnd this is driving me nuts.\u201d\r\n\u201cBut your knowing or not knowing Peter\u2019s HIV status\r\ndoesn\u2019t change it,\u201d my friend gave me the cold, harsh facts.\r\n\u201cIn fact, if you make an effort to know it, you\u2019ll make an\r\ninformed decision as to whether to proceed with the cut.\u201d\r\nThe next step was, of course, tackling Peter. Earlier\r\non, telling him about HIV, Aids and death was easier\r\nthan what I was now facing. When it came to whether\r\nor not he was infected, I found that I wasn\u2019t really strong\r\nenough to handle the matter. Each time he asked another\r\nquestion, I panicked. I had started by re-telling him how\r\nHIV is transmitted, with emphasis on mother-to-child\r\ntransmission and why I now wanted him tested for the virus.\r\n\u201cSo is it true that I have Aids like the neighbours are\r\nsaying?\u201d\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s why this test is important, Peter.\u201d\r\n\u201cWill I take the same drugs you\u2019re taking?\u201d\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll know that only after you have been tested. We\u2019ll\r\ncross that bridge when we come to it. I\u2019m sure everything\r\nwill be okay.\u201d\r\n\u201cAnd will I complete school now that I have Aids?\u201d\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll complete school. And, Peter, you don\u2019t have Aids.\r\nWhat I mean is, we need to establish whether you have the\r\nvirus that causes Aids. There\u2019s a big difference between HIV\r\nand Aids.\u201d\r\n\u201cSo, Mum, you don\u2019t have Aids?\u201d\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019m living with HIV.\u201d\r\nSince I tested HIV-positive, I\u2019ve had many of what I refer\r\nto as \u201cwhat if?\u201d moments. And as I drove along Ngong Road\r\ntaking Peter for an HIV test that morning, I had a trillion\r\nof \u201cwhat ifs?\u201d zooming through my mind. Several times I\r\nalmost made a U-turn and drove back home.\r\nWith Peter in the passenger\u2019s seat, I tried to play it cool,\r\nlike it was just another ordinary test. But my emotions\r\nwere all over the place. Although it was approximately a\r\n20-minute journey, emotionally, it is one of the longest road\r\ntrips I\u2019ve ever taken.\r\nPeter was tested and we got the results in three hours,\r\nduring which I went through hell.\r\n\u201cFinally, I can heave a sigh of relief,\u201d I told myself when the\r\ntest came back negative.\r\n\u201cFor now, we\u2019ve only confirmed that you didn\u2019t get HIV\r\nfrom me, which is the best news I\u2019ve heard in a long while,\u201d I\r\ngave Peter an impromptu post-test counselling.\r\n\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re immune to HIV infection.\r\nTake care. Your future is in your hands now.\u201d\r\nI was relieved that he wasn\u2019t infected, but I\u2019ve been\r\nin this business long enough to know that one fling, one\r\nmomentary lapse in judgement, is all it takes to make one\r\nsero-positive. The biggest relief would be to know that Mr\r\nand Mrs Peter Kanyi, and the generations after that, won\u2019t\r\ngo through the stuff I went through. It\u2019s my prayer that\r\ntoday, as we concentrate on fighting this virus, my children\r\nwill live in an HIV-free society. This is one of the best gifts we\r\ncan bequeath future generations.\r\nasuntawagura@hotmail.com"}
