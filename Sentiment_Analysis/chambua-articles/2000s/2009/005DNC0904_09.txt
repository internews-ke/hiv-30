Health experts have warned that unless
more people volunteer to be tested for
Aids, the war against the disease might
not be won.
Liverpool VCT, care and treatment director,
Dr Nduku Kilonzo said more than
15 million Kenyans were unaware of their
HIV status.
“The low number of people who have
been tested for HIV calls for innovative
approaches in a bid to realise the country’s
target of testing 80 per cent of the population
by 2010,” Dr Nduku said.
Experts say people who know their HIV
status early tend to become sexually responsible.
Latest Aids study
According to the latest Aids study, 84 per
cent of HIV infected people do not know
their status while 61 per cent regard themselves
to be low risk to HIV infection.
Kenya Medical Research Institute (CDC)
technical advisor, Ms Patricia Oluoch said
a majority of couples living in Kibera
slums had embraced home-based counselling
and testing.
Ms Oluoch said home-based care was
one of the key strategy identifi ed in accelerating
HIV testing among people living
in high population density with a high
Aids prevalence rate.
Through the President’s Emergency
Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar) support, at
least 5 million Kenyans will be counselled
and tested for HIV in 2009.
