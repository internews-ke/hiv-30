DONT PANIC, THE FLU IS NOT AS DEADLY AS WE FIRST THOUGHT

Kenyans should not panic following
confirmation of the country’s first
case of swine flu as available information
suggests the disease is not
as deadly as first thought.
Although World Health Organisation
declared the flu, caused by the
H1N1 virus, a global pandemic on
June 11, this did not imply that it
was a killer disease on the scale of
Aids or Ebola.
The latter kills up to 90 per cent of
those who contract it within days.
Contrary to public perception, the
term used by WHO — pandemic
— to describe H1N1 is used when a
disease covers a wide geographical
area and does not necessarily apply
to mortality (death) rate.
In fact, all evidence points to the
conclusion that H1N1 is not as devastating
as initially thought, with
its death rate probably being in the
lower single digit percentage (probably
much lower than 5 per cent).
So far, for example, out of the estimated
one million cases in America
(of which about 30,000 have been
confirmed), only 127 people have
been confirmed to have died of the
flu.
The outbreak in Kenya is also not
entirely unexpected. H1N1 has been
reported in more than 70 countries,
with the most recent cases in
countries as far apart as Myanmar,
Lithuania and Guatemala.
GIVEN KENYA’S POSITION AS
the regional travel hub as well as the
fact that there are more than one
million Kenyans living abroad, it was
inevitable that the disease would
eventually reach here.
Elsewhere, the availability of effective
anti-virals means that H1N1
is unlikely, in its current form, to
snowball into a major public health
crisis on the scope of HIV and Aids.
Although Kenya has fairly limited
stocks of these medicines, which
include Tamiflu, supplies can easily
be boosted if the need arises.
World Health Organisation has
enough drugs around the world to
treat up to 5 million people.
These stockpiles are a testament
to another fact that is not often
acknowledged — that the world is
today more prepared to deal with
pandemics like H1N1 than ever
before, many of the lessons learnt in
curbing new outbreaks coming from
HIV and Aids.
As a result, health experts across
the world have recognised the need
for continued disease surveillance
and quick response mechanisms, as
well as the establishment of global
networks to collaborate in research,
diagnosis and treatment.
It is instructive, in the case of H1N1,
that the Kenya Medical Research
Institute, which confirmed the index
case is part of the network of WHOaccredited
laboratories that act as
reference institutions.
In the last five years, these medical
networks have helped the world
deal with two other major scares,
Sars and bird-flu, both from Asia.
GIVEN THE KNOWN FACTS ABOUT
H1N1, as well as the global infrastructure
established to deal with
outbreaks, it is clear why experts
say that there is cause for optimism
with the latest outbreak.
Barring any unforeseen mutations
or interactions with other viruses,
H1N1 is likely to go the way of its
two precursors, Sars and bird flu.
Kenyans or anybody else, however,
should not drop their guard.
