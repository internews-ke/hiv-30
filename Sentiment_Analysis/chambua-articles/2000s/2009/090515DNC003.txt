She\r\ndecided to seek medical attention immediately.\r\nAfter days of agony as she waited for\r\nthe results, her mother, Regina Nzeki, encouraged\r\nher and promised to stand by\r\nher whatever the outcome.\r\nResults from her biopsy revealed the\r\ntumour was cancerous and the doctors\r\nhad to remove her breast, which was\r\ndone last May.\r\nThe bespectacled woman is celebrating\r\none year since her operation and is happy\r\nthat she was able to catch the \u2018quiet\u2019 disease\r\nbefore it was too late.\r\nShe encourages young women to take\r\nself breast examinations seriously to catch\r\nany symptoms of breast cancer.\r\n\u201cDo not ignore any lumps. The earlier\r\nthe better,\u201d she says wearing a broad\r\nsmile.\r\nCurrently she is on a 5-year medication\r\nand sees her doctor bi-annually for\r\ncheck-ups.\r\nNdanu is vibrant and besides wearing\r\nan artifi cial breast everyday she confesses\r\nthat her social life is normal. She still enjoys\r\nher favourite meals and is grateful to\r\na strong network of family and friends.\r\nAs an administrative assistant in Hurlingham,\r\nshe reports to work at 8am and\r\nleaves at 5pm everyday.\r\nShe shares her experiences with young\r\nwomen in churches and schools countrywide.\r\nLucky is a sign of a worrying trend\r\namong the medical experts who are seeing\r\nbreast cancer aff ecting younger people.\r\nChanged dramatically\r\n\u201cTraditionally the disease has been associated\r\nwith old age, but this has changed\r\ndramatically in the past few years,\u201d says\r\nDr Jotham Micheni, the chief executive offi\r\ncer at Kenyatta National Hospital.\r\nOf the 900 new breast cancer cases diagnosed\r\nat KNH last year, 360 of them\r\nwere young women aged between 20 and\r\n35 years.\r\nEven more worrying, Dr Micheni said\r\nyesterday, is the fact that out of 350 cases\r\npresented for admission in the same period,\r\nmore than half of them were at late\r\nstages.\r\n\u201cMost of the late stage cases are expensive\r\nto treat and hardly do they produce\r\nthe desired results,\u201d said Dr Micheni while\r\nreceiving a mammography unit \u2013 a system\r\nfor diagnosing breast cancer, donated by a\r\nUS based organisation, Radiology Mammography\r\nInternational.\r\nThe emerging trend where breast cancer\r\nis increasingly aff ecting young women\r\nand men has been largely attributed to\r\nchanging lifestyles \u2014 consuming over\r\nprocessed foods, too much alcohol and\r\nsmoking coupled with heredity traits and\r\nnow HIV/Aids.\r\n\u201cAids generally lowers the body immunity\r\nmaking it susceptible to disease\r\nchallenges including cancers,\u201d explained\r\nDr Henry Wanga, an interventional radiologist.\r\nWhile the cancer burden grows in\r\nthe country, KNH remains the only public\r\nhospital that manages the disease. But according\r\nto the director, it is over-stretched,\r\nold and requires a total overhaul.\r\n\u201cThe unit is due for overhaul, having\r\nserved the hospital for 20 years,\u201d says Dr\r\nMicheni.\r\nHis observations are in agreement\r\nwith fi ndings within the larger ministry\r\nof health. Recently the Director of Medical\r\nServices Dr Francis Kimani, said the\r\ngovernment was concerned about the\r\nincreasing cases of cancer deaths in the\r\ncountry.\r\nDr Kimani said an upsurge of cancer\r\nwas being reported in Kenya now more\r\nthan 10 years ago and there has been a\r\nsignifi cant increase of the disease among\r\nyounger people.\r\nDr Kimani said the disease killed about\r\n18,000 people in the country in 2005.\r\nCancer ranks third as the cause of death\r\nafter infections (including HIV) and heart\r\ndiseases. The disease contributes to 6.5\r\nper cent of all deaths annually.\r\nThe World Health Organisation\u2019s International\r\nAgency for Research on Cancer\r\n(IARC) estimates that about 82,000 new\r\ncases of cancer occurred annually in the\r\ncountry.\r\nAmong men, the three most common\r\ncancers are those of the oesophagus\r\n(throat), prostate and Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma\r\nwhile in women, breast cancer is the leading\r\ncause of death followed by cervical\r\nand throat cancer respectively.\r\nMedical experts have attributed the\r\ndrastic change in disease patterns in the\r\ncountry to social and economic changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW STUDY URGES MALE CUT TO FIGHT HERPES AND AIDS\r\n\r\nBy NATION Reporter\r\nMale circumcision reduces\r\nchances of contracting the\r\nherpes virus that accelerates\r\nAids-related deaths, according\r\nto experts.\r\nMedical researchers from\r\nthe University of Nairobi, Moi\r\nReferral Hospital, University\r\nof Washington and the Kenya\r\nGovernment said the virus,\r\nknown as HSV-2, subjects\r\nAids patients to a double blow\r\nin their immunity.\r\nIn view of this, they added,\r\nmale circumcision is vital in\r\nprotecting couples from the\r\ntwo deadly killer viruses.\r\nThe team of experts, led by\r\nthe National Aids/STI Programme\r\ndirector, Dr Nicholas\r\nMuraguri, said many people\r\nwith HIV/Aids also have herpes.\r\nSpeaking during a twoday\r\nworkshop in Nairobi, they\r\nsaid frequent recurrence of\r\ngenital herpes increases the\r\namount of HIV in the blood\r\nand genital tract.\r\nTheir remarks are based on\r\na study by Partners in Prevention\r\nof HSV/HIV, which was\r\nconducted among 3,408 discordant\r\ncouples.\r\nIn all the couples, the partner\r\nwho had HIV also had\r\nHSV-2 infection. The research\r\nwas conducted at 14 sites in\r\nseven countries in Eastern and\r\nSouthern Africa. They include\r\nBotswana, Kenya, Rwanda,\r\nSouth Africa, Tanzania, Uganda\r\nand Zambia.\r\nMinimal signs\r\nThe report encourages male\r\ncircumcision as a means of\r\nprotecting people from contracting\r\nherpes and HIV/Aids.\r\nGenital herpes is a sexually\r\ntransmitted disease caused by\r\nthe Herpes Simplex Virus Type\r\n2. Most herpes patients are not\r\naware of their condition because\r\nthe initial stages of the\r\ndisease show minimal signs.\r\nResearch shows that people\r\nwith genital herpes are more\r\nlikely to acquire HIV. It is in\r\nthis light that the Partners in\r\nPrevention study was conducted.\r\nThe objective was to\r\nfi nd out the eff ect of reducing\r\nherpes infection as a prevention\r\nmeasure for HIV."}
