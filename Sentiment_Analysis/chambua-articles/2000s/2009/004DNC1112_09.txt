New report unearths
high levels of physical
violence against them
by their partners

By KEN OPALA
H aif of Kenyan women liv
ing with HIV/Aids have
been physically abused in
the past year, accoMing to
a new study that highlights the wor
risome link between the scourge and
violence against women.
At least one in two of the victims
interviewed said they had been
slapped or shoved, 40 per cent had
been kicked or beaten, 36 per cent
had been hit with an object while 31
per cent had been threatened by use
of a knife or a weapon.
“These results are indicative of
high levels of physical violence
against women by their partners ...
the consequence ranges from pain
to death,” says Linkages between
Violence against Women and HW/
AIDS among WOFAK Beneficiar
ies, a report prepared by Dr Mumbi
Machem for Women Fighting Aids
in Kenya (WOFAK) and ActionAid
International Kenya, and which was
published this week.
The study was carried out in Nyan
za, Coast, Western and Nairobi prov
inoes.
“Rape and sexual exploitation are
prevalent in all the study areas. It
is also evident that violence is com
mon among adolescent girls. Aids or
phans, especially young girls are at a
higher risk of forced marriage.”
Guardians force girls into mar
nage to shove responsibility to the
husband. These girls risk mistreat
ment and other forms of violence,
including rape. This increases their
vulnerability to 111V infection, the
report indicates.
Physical abuse apart, the inci
dence of psychological, economic
and cultural trauma is much more
worrying.
Social Isolation
Nearly nine in ten of women with
111V face social isolation or have been
denied basic tights, such as food and
medical care. They also risk being
evicted out of their homes or denied
employment.
“We found that women who dis
close their 1-1W status face mistreat
ment by their husband’s relatives.
Most widows face the risk of being
disinherited by relatives. For women
in rural areas like Bumala, cases of
property tights abuse are common.
Women are often chased out of their
matrimonial homes as soon as the
husband dies’
However, the study further estab
lished that the victims of violence
are reluctant to talk about their ex
periences or even negotiate for better
medical attention.
