Kenya yet to honour
Aids funds pledge

By NATION Correspondent
Kenya has been faulted for reneging
on a pledge to allocate
adequate funding to combat
Aids.
The country had failed to allocate
15 per cent of the gross
national budget to the health
sector, World Aids Campaign
Africa regional coordinator
Linda Mafu said in Nairobi
yesterday.
During the Abuja Heads of
State meeting held in Nigeria
in 2000, Kenya was among
countries that pledged to allocate
15 per cent of their budget
to health.
According to experts, following
the split of the Health ministry
into two — Medical Services,
and Public Health and
Sanitation — the combined
budgetary allocation now
stands at nine per cent.
Ms Mafu said the war
against HIV and Aids was unlikely
to be won if Kenya and
other countries failed to fulfi l
their earlier pledges.
The official was speaking
during the launch of an ActionAid
report titled “Primary
concern: Why primary healthcare
is key to tackling HIV
and Aids” by National Aids
Control Council chairperson
Miriam Were.
The ceremony was held at
Kenyatta International Conference
Centre, Nairobi.
Earlier, Prof Were urged the
government to ensure that
adequate measures were put
in place to ensure constant
availability of anti-retroviral
drugs.
About 230,000 of the 1.3 million
people living with Aids in
Kenya have been enrolled in
the ARV programme.
According to the ActionAid
report, more than three million
lives could be saved and
an additional three million
people could remain free of
HIV if the country targets for
universal access to HIV services
were achieved by 2010.
“Despite national and international
commitments to
achieve universal access to
HIV prevention, treatment,
care and support, many people
do not have access to the
HIV services they need, especially
in poor, rural areas,” the
report says.
“As a result, for every two
people beginning HIV treatment,
fi ve are newly infected
and just one in fi ve people at
risk of infection has access to
comprehensive HIV prevention
services.”
With 2010 just a year away, it
is clear that the rate of progress
needs to be stepped up.
