Parents, teachers, and fellow students,	Aids kills. Take care of your body and you
will live a happy life.

When my friend’s mother got infected, she lost weight and her hair fell off.
People rejected her and I felt her pain	. When she died, my friend and his sisters were taken in by their grandmother who	is doing her best to give them love and be their parent. After this experience,	I have decided I want to be a doctor so I can help HIV and Aids suﬀerers in our society and also try to ﬁnd a cure for HIV and Aids.
