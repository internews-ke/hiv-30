denial about presence of homosexuals

searchers found that condom
and lubricant use among the
male sex workers is low. For instance
42 per cent of the male
sex workers had not used a
condom with their last male
client. Overall, 48 per cent
said their condom use was inconsistent.
Researchers attribute this
low rate of condom use to
what they called a “dismal”
level of basic knowledge about
HIV transmission and prevention.
Many of them did not
know that HIV could be transmitted
through unprotected
sex, and many said they didn’t
use lubrication because it was
too costly. It’s no wonder, then,
that the 2007 Kenya AIDS Indicator
Survey (KAIS) found
the 15 per cent of all new HIV
infections in Kenya are from
MSM related activities.
But perhaps the most sobering
finding echoes a trend
that shows no sign of slowing.
Most of these male sex workers
are bisexual, meaning they
regularly have sex with both
men and women. More importantly,
many of these men
had travelled a torturous path,
often existing on the fringes of
society whether they are still
sex workers or in committed
long-term relationships.
Just ask a 33-year-old gay
man we’ll call Elijah. He grew
up in a polygamous family
in Nyanza Province. Elijah’s
journey to adolescent self-discovery
was unlike that of his
peers. “I knew I was different
because I felt attracted to
other boys,” he says.
But he couldn’t really pinpoint
what was happening
to him until he was about 14
years old, when his biology
teacher mentioned that there
were some men who preferred
being with other men.
“Well, that’s me,” Elijah remembers
thinking. Despite
his curiosity, he didn’t ask
for more information, fearing
teasing from his peers.
Outside the classroom, Elijah
heard very little on the
topic. “There was this mad
man from our village who people
said liked other men, so I
grew up thinking that since I
like other men, too, I would
also wind up mad,” he says.
Religion was yet another
source of conflict; Elijah believed
he was condemned. He
was torn between the need to
be himself and the longing for
acceptance from society.
This gruelling internal tug
of war pushed Elijah to try
and change his orientation.
First he turned to the church,
seeking “deliverance.” But he
says that was discouraging:
“After coming back from the
mountains where we fasted
and prayed for four days, I still
felt the same.” At the age of 17,
Elijah sought a more permanent
“solution” — suicide. Two
attempts failed. He moved to
Kisumu at the age of 18 where
he worked shining shoes. Elijah’s
new friends quickly noticed
he didn’t socialise much
with girls.
They tried matchmaking,
which Elijah allowed. “I
thought being with a woman,
might help me become
‘straight’,” he explains.
But not only was this first
sexual experience unsatisfying,
the girl also got pregnant.
Elijah was saddled with the
twins as the mother wanted
nothing to do with them.
Because further interactions
with women proved futile, Elijah
was back to the drawing
board. His friends suggested
that he tries being with a man
this time round, and Elijah
had his first homosexual encounter
at the age of 19.
Of this, he says, “It was the
most satisfying experience I
had ever had in my life.” But
like many of his counterparts,
Elijah noticed a gut-wrenching
trend among his early
homosexual partners — they
had wives.
“Most of these men had
pushed themselves to marry
due to societal pressure, and
they were using their wives as
covers,” Elijah says.
Elijah moved to Mombasa
at age 20, where he’s been in
a committed relationship with
another man from Nyanza for
the last seven years. He says
his boyfriend has been very
supportive in raising his now
14-year-old twins.
Elijah’s story hints that, just
perhaps, some people are gay
by way of being. His story also
seems to challenge the common
belief that homosexuality
is a lifestyle adopted by a few
rich, Westernized Kenyans.
Few expect a poignant personal
story to change deeplyrooted
cultural and religious
beliefs that flatly condemn
homosexuality in Kenya. It
seems clear, based on the vociferously
negative public debate
that homosexuality will
remain in the shadows for the
time being.
That’s why outreach and advocacy
are critically needed by
Kenyan homosexuals. It might
seem obvious that any national
HIV prevention strategy
would include a strong focus
on homosexual behaviour.
But that takes the conversation
back to an overall “if
you ignore it, it doesn’t exist”
premise.
African countries
As in most African countries,
Kenya’s policy and programmatic
responses to HIV prevention
have focused primarily
on reducing heterosexual
and mother-to-child transmission.
Indeed, adult HIV transmission
and risk have only
been associated to vaginal sex
and heterosexual promiscuity.
“It struck us that in the 25
years that Kenya had been battling
the HIV epidemic, no one
had tried targeting anal sex for
preventing HIV transmission,”
says Dr. Sanders of the Kemri/
Wellcome Trust Programme.
“Yet we knew it happens and
not just in the homosexual
community, but also among
some heterosexual couples.”
But Dr Sanders warns that
ignoring this reality is a grievous
mistake on the part of the
Government. “A HIV prevention
strategy that does not encompass
anal health is simply
incomplete,” he says.
Statistics seem to have
slightly swayed the Government’s
stand. The National
AIDS/STD Control Council
(NASCOP) will be designing a
poster to educate the public on
anal health.
However, more rigorous
action is needed due to the
extreme stigmatisation of
homosexuality in Kenya. Mr
Jacob Mikwali, the director of
Ishtar MSM, a support group
for gay Kenyan men, describes
repeated instances of blatant
discrimination against gay
men from within medical
circles.
“We have had numerous
cases of our members being
turned away by doctors who
say it is against their moral
conviction to treat gay men,”
he says. “Others are ridiculed
and laughed out of the doctors
offices if they come in with an
anal STI.”
Mikwale says that these
men deserve basic fundamental
rights like health care, regardless
of why they engage in
homosexual behaviour.
Mr Allan Muhaari, a
counsellor with the Kemri/
Wellcome Trust program, says
the Government must properly
educate all its healthcare
providers.
“All we are asking of the
Government, is to make sure
that all Kenyans can access
equal sexual healthcare in
spite of their sexual orientation,”
he says,
“And perhaps the easiest
way to do that would be to include
anal health care into the
healthcare curriculum.”
Change beliefs
In short, the researchers who
study homosexual activity in
Kenya aren’t out to change
your religious or moral beliefs.
They are simply advising
that collectively burying our
heads in the sand ignores a
threat to the nation’s overall
health that can’t be categorised
as moral, cultural, or religious.
It is simply lethal.
And of the “gay lifestyle,”
community activist Mikwali
says; “We are here, we are Kenyan,
we are your brothers, your
uncles or even your husbands,
and so we better find a way to
live together.”
