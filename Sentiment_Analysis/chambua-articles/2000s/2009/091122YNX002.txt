Take care of your body and you\r\nwill live a happy life.\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\nMary Gitau, 12, Gilgil Hills Academy, Eldoret\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\nWhen my friend\u2019s mother got infected, she lost weight and her hair fell off.\r\nPeople rejected her and I felt her pain\t. When she died, my friend and his sisters were taken in by their grandmother who\tis doing her best to give them love and be their parent. After this experience,\tI have decided I want to be a doctor so I can help HIV and Aids su\ufb00erers in our society and also try to \ufb01nd a cure for HIV and Aids.\t\r\n\r\nEuphemia Mongina Abobo, 15, Loreto High\tSchool, Limuru"}
