{"text": "\ufeffDAILY NATION\r\n\r\nWEDNESDAY AUGUST 12, 2009\r\n\r\nLIVING POSITIVELY\r\nSometimes, despite your best\r\nefforts, the body just wants to\r\nshut down for a while\r\nI hope this article clarifies a few issues following a number of\r\ne-mail messages from people wanting to know how my \u2018girl\r\nproject\u2019 went. But there was one message inquiring about\r\nsomething rather personal \u2013 my sex life. I\u2019ll be honest, both issues\r\nare in jeopardy. The other day, as I was wondering about the best\r\nway forward, an international magazine known as Nam arrived\r\njust in time to explain my predicament. In one of the articles, it\r\nwas said that antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) lower the sex drive of\r\npeople who have used them for extended periods.\r\n\u201cAnxiety and depression, bad sleep, bad sex and low selfesteem:\r\nthese are our biggest bugbears as people living with\r\nHIV,\u201d the article said in part. Finally I understood what was\r\nhappening to me \u2013 ARVs have affected my sex life, and this has in\r\nturn affected my relationship with Richard. I wanted to raise the\r\nissue with my doctor on two separate occasions but my courage\r\nfailed each time and we ended up discussing other issues, no less\r\nimportant but not what had taken me there.\r\nI still remember the way I itemised my list during my last visit.\r\nFirst I told him my concentration is suffering, which is not a good\r\nthing because I\u2019m in the middle of studying. The only things I\r\nread, register and never forget are things to do with HIV. Colour\r\nme biased, but my levels of alertness rise whenever I come\r\nacross anything concerning this virus. But when it comes to other\r\nmaterials, including study texts, boredom and sleep take over\r\nwithin a few minutes.\r\n\u201cNo sweat,\u201d the doctor remarked and suggested something I\r\ncould use. I\u2019m yet to see the results of whatever he prescribed.\r\nThen I told him I\u2019m really bored of having to swallow ARVs\r\nevery day. I have been popping the pills twice a day for seven\r\nyears now, and even my son, Joshua, has become familiar with\r\nmy \u2018drug habit\u2019. Whenever I come home he runs to hug me then\r\npoints to the shelf where I store my ARVs and asks my foster\r\ndaughter to bring me a glass of water. At two years, Joshua has\r\ncome to accept that taking the drugs is part of Mum\u2019s life.\r\n\u201cWhen can I begin my drug holiday?\u201d I asked my doctor\r\nbecause I felt I needed a break from ARVs. I got this idea from a\r\nmeeting I attended for people living with HIV and Aids (PLWHAs).\r\nThey said there is something called a drug holiday.\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your CD4 count?\u201d the doctor asked.\r\n\u201cSix hundred and something.\u201d\r\nHoliday thoughts\r\n\u201cWhen was the last time you had a CD4 count?\u201d\r\nThat\u2019s where my holiday thoughts came to a screeching halt\r\nbecause it\u2019s been more than six months since my last count.\r\n\u201cWe can\u2019t rely on history,\u201d he shrugged. \u201cLet\u2019s do this.\u201d\r\nIn one hour flat we had the results, which surprised me: my\r\ncount had dropped from a high of 650 to a dangerously low 347.\r\n\u201cWhat have you been doing wrong?\u201d he prodded.\r\nOf course, I didn\u2019t tell him that for the last one year\r\n\u2013 disregarding the risks of re-infection \u2013 I\u2019ve been trying,\r\nunsuccessfully, to conceive \u2018my\u2019 baby girl.\r\n\u201cMy viral load is undetectable,\u201d I said, trying to look on the\r\nbright side, \u201cand surely that qualifies me for a drug holiday.\u201d\r\n\u201cListen good,\u201d he laughed, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing like a drug holiday;\r\nwherever you got that from, it\u2019s misleading.\u201d\r\nAnd with that he ordered my three months\u2019 supply of ARVs. It\r\nwas at this point that I postponed the next item on my agenda:\r\nthe downward spiral of my sex life. Plus, I felt awkward because I\r\nknew he would put two and two together.\r\nI never intended to bring this up, but there was nothing\r\nbetter thing to do while we waited for my drugs to come from\r\nthe pharmacy. So I told him I\u2019m extremely worried because the\r\nhump on my back \u2013 lipodystrophy in medical lingo \u2013 seems to\r\nbe growing bigger by the day. My legs are also looking thinner,\r\nalthough it\u2019s not as if I want to show them off \u2013 I kissed miniskirts\r\ngoodbye years ago. But I was hoping if I took a drug holiday,\r\nI could at least \u2018get my sexy back\u2019, somehow. The doctor was\r\nunmoved by my new approach to ARVs, my body image issues or\r\nany of the debilitating side effects I listed for him.\r\n\u201cAsunta, what I\u2019m worried about right now is your CD4 count.\r\nNot your hump or thin legs. Those can wait. There\u2019s no need to\r\nremind you what a drop in your CD4 count can do to you.\u201d\r\nI dropped the matter. My drugs had arrived and I was happy to\r\nhurriedly exit as I agreed to check my CD4 every three months\r\ninstead of six. Maybe I\u2019m pushing the envelope a bit here, but all I\r\nknow is that my whole system is screaming for a holiday.\r\nasuntawagura@hotmail.com\r\nSorely in need of\r\ndrug-free holiday"}
