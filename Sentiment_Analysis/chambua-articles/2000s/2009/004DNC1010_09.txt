New Aids infections
attack the youth most

Up to 60 per cent of all new sexually
transmitted infections, including
HIV and Aids, occur in those
aged 15 to 24. And the number
could rise if no signifi cant change
in the sexual behaviour and practices
of Kenya’s youth is recorded,
a scientifi c conference in Nairobi
heard yesterday. Mr Jared Odhiambo
presented results of the study
at the second Scientifi c Conference
at Kenyatta National Hospital.
The study found that a quarter
of Kenyan youth, aged 15 to 24, are
engaged in risky sexual practices
that increase their chances of contracting
STI’s.
