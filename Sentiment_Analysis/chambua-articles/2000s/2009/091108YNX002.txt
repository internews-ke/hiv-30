{"text": "\ufeffSunday Nation November 8, 2009\r\n\r\nWhere are youths\r\nheading?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImmorality among the youth is reaching alarming heights. Many young people ape what they see, read and hear on television,\r\n\r\nin magazines, and on radio not realising that some of the stu\ufb00 in the media is being broadcast for entertainment purposes only and\r\ndo not re\ufb02ect real life. Others give in to peer pressure and engage in premarital sex as if they have never heard of HIV and AIDS and many young girls are having babies before completing their education.\r\n\r\nThis is how many dreams are buried. Our problems lie in the fact that parents are shy and have refused to discuss issues related to sex with their children and that is why children as young as 12 years old are having sex. Society, the church and government must work together to save the situation. My fellow youth, do not be lured into destroying your future with gifts and empty promises. CHILL.\r\n\r\nMirikau Moses Ombayo,\r\n\r\nKampala Uganda\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHIV QUOTES:\r\n\r\nTo all the children who are Aids orphans or HIV positive, I want to tell you that those who mistreat you, laugh at you or refuse to play with you are not your friends. They are ignorant.Right now do not focus on friends, butwork hard in school and you will succeed. \r\n\r\nMartha Aluoch, 11, SOS Hermann Gmeiner Primary School, Nairobi\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAids kills boys, girls, the rich, poor, old, young, even the bright and dull. It does not choose.\r\nAlbinah Mghoi Mkilo\r\n\r\n\r\nI \ufb01rst heard of HIV/Aids from my grandmother. Do not be misled by your peers.\r\n\r\nDavid Wairegi, Kiambu High Schooland"}
