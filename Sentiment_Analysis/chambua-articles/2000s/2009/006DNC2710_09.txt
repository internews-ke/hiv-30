Lobby asks MPs
to give voters
health scorecard.

NGO wants those
eyeing seats in 2012
to outline progress
they have made

Sitting MPs intending to defend
their seats in 2012 might be required
to give voters a scorecard
on reproductive health
policies during their terms.
African Population and Health Research
Centre (Aphrc), a local nongovernmental
organisation, is proposing
that candidates in the next
General Election be required to account
for health-related issues or Bills
they formulated or discussed.
Currently, 40 women die daily
from pregnancy-related causes, a
situation that needs to be urgently
addressed by MPs if Kenya is to attain
the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs).
“None of them should be back in
offi ce until they outline their achievements,”
said Aphrc head of policy engagement
Charles Okigbo.
According to recent statistics, more
than 300,000 women in Kenya procure
abortions every year.
“The MPs hold the key to most, if
not all, of the country’s health system
and policies that can improve
Kenya’s ailing health facilities,” said
Ms Rose Oronje, Aphrc communications
offi cer.
The evaluation, the researchers
said, would be based on the MPs’
commitment to discussing health-related
Bills and participating in advocacy
campaigns during their tenure.
Questioned
United Nations member states adopted
eight MDGs in 2000, setting the
year 2015 as the target for attaining
them. Three of them are health-related.
Goal Four involves reducing child
mortality; Goal Five is intended to
improve maternal health; and Goal
Six is aimed at combating HIV and
Aids, malaria and other diseases.
According to Ms Oronje, the MPs
should be questioned because they
largely make laws. “Most voters are
women, thus they remain accountable
to them,” she said.
The researchers approached MPs
who were keen to promote reproductive
issues and recognised them as
‘health champions’.
The MPs took part in awareness
workshops aimed at drafting policies
that would later be debated in
Parliament.
