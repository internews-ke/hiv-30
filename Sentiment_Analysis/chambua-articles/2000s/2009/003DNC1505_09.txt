At only 22, Ndanu
has lost a breast to
the disease but lives
her life to the full

With her confi dent gait and exuberant
smile, Lucky Ndanu
is testimony of a young lady
who has dealt with an ailment
that has long been associated with
old age.
At 22, Ndanu was diagnosed with breast
cancer and resolved this would not drag
her down nor curtail her dreams.
In November, 2007, she started experiencing
pain in her right breast and noticed
a small lump in the right one. She
decided to seek medical attention immediately.
After days of agony as she waited for
the results, her mother, Regina Nzeki, encouraged
her and promised to stand by
her whatever the outcome.
Results from her biopsy revealed the
tumour was cancerous and the doctors
had to remove her breast, which was
done last May.
The bespectacled woman is celebrating
one year since her operation and is happy
that she was able to catch the ‘quiet’ disease
before it was too late.
She encourages young women to take
self breast examinations seriously to catch
any symptoms of breast cancer.
“Do not ignore any lumps. The earlier
the better,” she says wearing a broad
smile.
Currently she is on a 5-year medication
and sees her doctor bi-annually for
check-ups.
Ndanu is vibrant and besides wearing
an artifi cial breast everyday she confesses
that her social life is normal. She still enjoys
her favourite meals and is grateful to
a strong network of family and friends.
As an administrative assistant in Hurlingham,
she reports to work at 8am and
leaves at 5pm everyday.
She shares her experiences with young
women in churches and schools countrywide.
Lucky is a sign of a worrying trend
among the medical experts who are seeing
breast cancer aff ecting younger people.
Changed dramatically
“Traditionally the disease has been associated
with old age, but this has changed
dramatically in the past few years,” says
Dr Jotham Micheni, the chief executive offi
cer at Kenyatta National Hospital.
Of the 900 new breast cancer cases diagnosed
at KNH last year, 360 of them
were young women aged between 20 and
35 years.
Even more worrying, Dr Micheni said
yesterday, is the fact that out of 350 cases
presented for admission in the same period,
more than half of them were at late
stages.
“Most of the late stage cases are expensive
to treat and hardly do they produce
the desired results,” said Dr Micheni while
receiving a mammography unit – a system
for diagnosing breast cancer, donated by a
US based organisation, Radiology Mammography
International.
The emerging trend where breast cancer
is increasingly aff ecting young women
and men has been largely attributed to
changing lifestyles — consuming over
processed foods, too much alcohol and
smoking coupled with heredity traits and
now HIV/Aids.
“Aids generally lowers the body immunity
making it susceptible to disease
challenges including cancers,” explained
Dr Henry Wanga, an interventional radiologist.
While the cancer burden grows in
the country, KNH remains the only public
hospital that manages the disease. But according
to the director, it is over-stretched,
old and requires a total overhaul.
“The unit is due for overhaul, having
served the hospital for 20 years,” says Dr
Micheni.
His observations are in agreement
with fi ndings within the larger ministry
of health. Recently the Director of Medical
Services Dr Francis Kimani, said the
government was concerned about the
increasing cases of cancer deaths in the
country.
Dr Kimani said an upsurge of cancer
was being reported in Kenya now more
than 10 years ago and there has been a
signifi cant increase of the disease among
younger people.
Dr Kimani said the disease killed about
18,000 people in the country in 2005.
Cancer ranks third as the cause of death
after infections (including HIV) and heart
diseases. The disease contributes to 6.5
per cent of all deaths annually.
The World Health Organisation’s International
Agency for Research on Cancer
(IARC) estimates that about 82,000 new
cases of cancer occurred annually in the
country.
Among men, the three most common
cancers are those of the oesophagus
(throat), prostate and Kaposi’s sarcoma
while in women, breast cancer is the leading
cause of death followed by cervical
and throat cancer respectively.
Medical experts have attributed the
drastic change in disease patterns in the
country to social and economic changes.



NEW STUDY URGES MALE CUT TO FIGHT HERPES AND AIDS

By NATION Reporter
Male circumcision reduces
chances of contracting the
herpes virus that accelerates
Aids-related deaths, according
to experts.
Medical researchers from
the University of Nairobi, Moi
Referral Hospital, University
of Washington and the Kenya
Government said the virus,
known as HSV-2, subjects
Aids patients to a double blow
in their immunity.
In view of this, they added,
male circumcision is vital in
protecting couples from the
two deadly killer viruses.
The team of experts, led by
the National Aids/STI Programme
director, Dr Nicholas
Muraguri, said many people
with HIV/Aids also have herpes.
Speaking during a twoday
workshop in Nairobi, they
said frequent recurrence of
genital herpes increases the
amount of HIV in the blood
and genital tract.
Their remarks are based on
a study by Partners in Prevention
of HSV/HIV, which was
conducted among 3,408 discordant
couples.
In all the couples, the partner
who had HIV also had
HSV-2 infection. The research
was conducted at 14 sites in
seven countries in Eastern and
Southern Africa. They include
Botswana, Kenya, Rwanda,
South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda
and Zambia.
Minimal signs
The report encourages male
circumcision as a means of
protecting people from contracting
herpes and HIV/Aids.
Genital herpes is a sexually
transmitted disease caused by
the Herpes Simplex Virus Type
2. Most herpes patients are not
aware of their condition because
the initial stages of the
disease show minimal signs.
Research shows that people
with genital herpes are more
likely to acquire HIV. It is in
this light that the Partners in
Prevention study was conducted.
The objective was to
fi nd out the eff ect of reducing
herpes infection as a prevention
measure for HIV.
