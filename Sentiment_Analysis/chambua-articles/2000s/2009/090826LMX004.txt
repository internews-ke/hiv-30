{"text": "\ufeffWEDNESDAY AUGUST 26, 2009\r\nHEALTH:\r\n\r\nABOUT THOSE TEETHING PROBLEMS\r\n\r\n\r\nMost parents regard the appearance of\r\nan infant\u2019s first tooth as a significant\r\ndevelopmental milestone. However,\r\nthe teething period can be difficult and\r\ndistressing for both baby and parents. Most\r\nchildren get their first tooth around six\r\nmonths of age and have a complete set of 20\r\nprimary teeth by 30 months. Teeth tend to\r\nemerge in pairs, with the lower teeth erupting\r\nprior to the upper teeth. Girls often get their\r\nteeth earlier than boys.\r\nEveryone seems to have a list of symptoms\r\nthey believe are linked to teething. However,\r\na proper diagnosis of teething seems to\r\nalleviate and calm parental anxiety. The\r\nsymptoms seen most consistently are biting/\r\nmouthing, drooling, gum rubbing, increased\r\nirritability, appetite disturbance and mild\r\ntemperature elevation. Other signs commonly\r\nattributed to teething \u2013diarrhoea/loose stool,\r\ncoughing, congestion, ear rubbing, rashes,\r\nvomiting, higher fever and convulsions \u2013 have\r\nnot been found to have any relationship to\r\nteething.\r\nThese signs are much more likely to have\r\nanother cause as during this time, a baby\u2019s\r\nimmunity from maternal antibodies is waning\r\nand exposure to a wide variety of childhood\r\nillnesses could occur.\r\nWith the understanding that teething\r\ncauses localised symptoms at the point of\r\neruption, the best treatments are those that\r\nrelieve these complaints. The expression\r\n\u201cborn with a silver spoon in his mouth\u201d has\r\nits origin as a teething remedy. Most silver\r\nspoons, however, have been replaced by more\r\naffordable textured or cold teething rings for\r\ninfants to \u2018gnaw\u2019 on. The low temperature\r\nof the object causes localised constriction\r\nof blood vessels and decreases the\r\ninflammation, and biting on the object gives\r\nrelief by applying pressure to the gums.\r\nUsing a clean finger, moistened gauze pad\r\nor damp washcloth to massage the baby\u2019s\r\ngums could also help in easing discomfort.\r\nOther treatments, such as teething biscuits\r\nand frozen or cold vegetables (carrots or\r\npeeled cucumber) work by creating pressure\r\non the gums. However, such remedies should\r\nnot be used on children who are not yet\r\neating solid foods. High sugar content foods\r\nare not recommended.\r\nSupervision is needed to ensure that small\r\npieces of food do not break off and pose a\r\nchoking hazard. Teething rings should be\r\nattached to the infant\u2019s clothing, and not\r\ntied around the neck, as strangulation could\r\nresult. The conservative use of painkillers\r\n(paracetamol and ibuprofen) could also ease\r\nany teething discomfort. Other popular overthe-\r\ncounter remedies such as those that are\r\nrubbed directly on the baby\u2019s gums should\r\nbe used with caution and are generally not\r\nrecommended.\r\nDr Kamau Kinyenje\r\npointofcare@africaonline.co.ke"}
