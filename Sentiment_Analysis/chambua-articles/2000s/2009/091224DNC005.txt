{"text": "\ufeffDAILY NATION Thursday December 24, 2009\r\ndenial about presence of homosexuals\r\n\r\nsearchers found that condom\r\nand lubricant use among the\r\nmale sex workers is low. For instance\r\n42 per cent of the male\r\nsex workers had not used a\r\ncondom with their last male\r\nclient. Overall, 48 per cent\r\nsaid their condom use was inconsistent.\r\nResearchers attribute this\r\nlow rate of condom use to\r\nwhat they called a \u201cdismal\u201d\r\nlevel of basic knowledge about\r\nHIV transmission and prevention.\r\nMany of them did not\r\nknow that HIV could be transmitted\r\nthrough unprotected\r\nsex, and many said they didn\u2019t\r\nuse lubrication because it was\r\ntoo costly. It\u2019s no wonder, then,\r\nthat the 2007 Kenya AIDS Indicator\r\nSurvey (KAIS) found\r\nthe 15 per cent of all new HIV\r\ninfections in Kenya are from\r\nMSM related activities.\r\nBut perhaps the most sobering\r\nfinding echoes a trend\r\nthat shows no sign of slowing.\r\nMost of these male sex workers\r\nare bisexual, meaning they\r\nregularly have sex with both\r\nmen and women. More importantly,\r\nmany of these men\r\nhad travelled a torturous path,\r\noften existing on the fringes of\r\nsociety whether they are still\r\nsex workers or in committed\r\nlong-term relationships.\r\nJust ask a 33-year-old gay\r\nman we\u2019ll call Elijah. He grew\r\nup in a polygamous family\r\nin Nyanza Province. Elijah\u2019s\r\njourney to adolescent self-discovery\r\nwas unlike that of his\r\npeers. \u201cI knew I was different\r\nbecause I felt attracted to\r\nother boys,\u201d he says.\r\nBut he couldn\u2019t really pinpoint\r\nwhat was happening\r\nto him until he was about 14\r\nyears old, when his biology\r\nteacher mentioned that there\r\nwere some men who preferred\r\nbeing with other men.\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s me,\u201d Elijah remembers\r\nthinking. Despite\r\nhis curiosity, he didn\u2019t ask\r\nfor more information, fearing\r\nteasing from his peers.\r\nOutside the classroom, Elijah\r\nheard very little on the\r\ntopic. \u201cThere was this mad\r\nman from our village who people\r\nsaid liked other men, so I\r\ngrew up thinking that since I\r\nlike other men, too, I would\r\nalso wind up mad,\u201d he says.\r\nReligion was yet another\r\nsource of conflict; Elijah believed\r\nhe was condemned. He\r\nwas torn between the need to\r\nbe himself and the longing for\r\nacceptance from society.\r\nThis gruelling internal tug\r\nof war pushed Elijah to try\r\nand change his orientation.\r\nFirst he turned to the church,\r\nseeking \u201cdeliverance.\u201d But he\r\nsays that was discouraging:\r\n\u201cAfter coming back from the\r\nmountains where we fasted\r\nand prayed for four days, I still\r\nfelt the same.\u201d At the age of 17,\r\nElijah sought a more permanent\r\n\u201csolution\u201d \u2014 suicide. Two\r\nattempts failed. He moved to\r\nKisumu at the age of 18 where\r\nhe worked shining shoes. Elijah\u2019s\r\nnew friends quickly noticed\r\nhe didn\u2019t socialise much\r\nwith girls.\r\nThey tried matchmaking,\r\nwhich Elijah allowed. \u201cI\r\nthought being with a woman,\r\nmight help me become\r\n\u2018straight\u2019,\u201d he explains.\r\nBut not only was this first\r\nsexual experience unsatisfying,\r\nthe girl also got pregnant.\r\nElijah was saddled with the\r\ntwins as the mother wanted\r\nnothing to do with them.\r\nBecause further interactions\r\nwith women proved futile, Elijah\r\nwas back to the drawing\r\nboard. His friends suggested\r\nthat he tries being with a man\r\nthis time round, and Elijah\r\nhad his first homosexual encounter\r\nat the age of 19.\r\nOf this, he says, \u201cIt was the\r\nmost satisfying experience I\r\nhad ever had in my life.\u201d But\r\nlike many of his counterparts,\r\nElijah noticed a gut-wrenching\r\ntrend among his early\r\nhomosexual partners \u2014 they\r\nhad wives.\r\n\u201cMost of these men had\r\npushed themselves to marry\r\ndue to societal pressure, and\r\nthey were using their wives as\r\ncovers,\u201d Elijah says.\r\nElijah moved to Mombasa\r\nat age 20, where he\u2019s been in\r\na committed relationship with\r\nanother man from Nyanza for\r\nthe last seven years. He says\r\nhis boyfriend has been very\r\nsupportive in raising his now\r\n14-year-old twins.\r\nElijah\u2019s story hints that, just\r\nperhaps, some people are gay\r\nby way of being. His story also\r\nseems to challenge the common\r\nbelief that homosexuality\r\nis a lifestyle adopted by a few\r\nrich, Westernized Kenyans.\r\nFew expect a poignant personal\r\nstory to change deeplyrooted\r\ncultural and religious\r\nbeliefs that flatly condemn\r\nhomosexuality in Kenya. It\r\nseems clear, based on the vociferously\r\nnegative public debate\r\nthat homosexuality will\r\nremain in the shadows for the\r\ntime being.\r\nThat\u2019s why outreach and advocacy\r\nare critically needed by\r\nKenyan homosexuals. It might\r\nseem obvious that any national\r\nHIV prevention strategy\r\nwould include a strong focus\r\non homosexual behaviour.\r\nBut that takes the conversation\r\nback to an overall \u201cif\r\nyou ignore it, it doesn\u2019t exist\u201d\r\npremise.\r\nAfrican countries\r\nAs in most African countries,\r\nKenya\u2019s policy and programmatic\r\nresponses to HIV prevention\r\nhave focused primarily\r\non reducing heterosexual\r\nand mother-to-child transmission.\r\nIndeed, adult HIV transmission\r\nand risk have only\r\nbeen associated to vaginal sex\r\nand heterosexual promiscuity.\r\n\u201cIt struck us that in the 25\r\nyears that Kenya had been battling\r\nthe HIV epidemic, no one\r\nhad tried targeting anal sex for\r\npreventing HIV transmission,\u201d\r\nsays Dr. Sanders of the Kemri/\r\nWellcome Trust Programme.\r\n\u201cYet we knew it happens and\r\nnot just in the homosexual\r\ncommunity, but also among\r\nsome heterosexual couples.\u201d\r\nBut Dr Sanders warns that\r\nignoring this reality is a grievous\r\nmistake on the part of the\r\nGovernment. \u201cA HIV prevention\r\nstrategy that does not encompass\r\nanal health is simply\r\nincomplete,\u201d he says.\r\nStatistics seem to have\r\nslightly swayed the Government\u2019s\r\nstand. The National\r\nAIDS/STD Control Council\r\n(NASCOP) will be designing a\r\nposter to educate the public on\r\nanal health.\r\nHowever, more rigorous\r\naction is needed due to the\r\nextreme stigmatisation of\r\nhomosexuality in Kenya. Mr\r\nJacob Mikwali, the director of\r\nIshtar MSM, a support group\r\nfor gay Kenyan men, describes\r\nrepeated instances of blatant\r\ndiscrimination against gay\r\nmen from within medical\r\ncircles.\r\n\u201cWe have had numerous\r\ncases of our members being\r\nturned away by doctors who\r\nsay it is against their moral\r\nconviction to treat gay men,\u201d\r\nhe says. \u201cOthers are ridiculed\r\nand laughed out of the doctors\r\noffices if they come in with an\r\nanal STI.\u201d\r\nMikwale says that these\r\nmen deserve basic fundamental\r\nrights like health care, regardless\r\nof why they engage in\r\nhomosexual behaviour.\r\nMr Allan Muhaari, a\r\ncounsellor with the Kemri/\r\nWellcome Trust program, says\r\nthe Government must properly\r\neducate all its healthcare\r\nproviders.\r\n\u201cAll we are asking of the\r\nGovernment, is to make sure\r\nthat all Kenyans can access\r\nequal sexual healthcare in\r\nspite of their sexual orientation,\u201d\r\nhe says,\r\n\u201cAnd perhaps the easiest\r\nway to do that would be to include\r\nanal health care into the\r\nhealthcare curriculum.\u201d\r\nChange beliefs\r\nIn short, the researchers who\r\nstudy homosexual activity in\r\nKenya aren\u2019t out to change\r\nyour religious or moral beliefs.\r\nThey are simply advising\r\nthat collectively burying our\r\nheads in the sand ignores a\r\nthreat to the nation\u2019s overall\r\nhealth that can\u2019t be categorised\r\nas moral, cultural, or religious.\r\nIt is simply lethal.\r\nAnd of the \u201cgay lifestyle,\u201d\r\ncommunity activist Mikwali\r\nsays; \u201cWe are here, we are Kenyan,\r\nwe are your brothers, your\r\nuncles or even your husbands,\r\nand so we better find a way to\r\nlive together.\u201d"}
