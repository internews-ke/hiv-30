A woman\u2019s baby is\r\ndying of a disease and a nearby poster on\r\nthe wall gives details on how to prevent or\r\ncure it, yet she cannot interpret it despite\r\nhaving attended primaty schooL\r\nThis is part of a dilemma that a group of\r\neducation researchers are out to establish;\r\nwhether Kenya\u2019s citizens can read but can\r\nnot process information correctly\r\nEducation researchers have designed a\r\nunique test aimed at reviewing Kenyans\u2019\r\nability to read and write cornpetentlv despite\r\ngoing through a rigorous school system.\r\nBe shocked\r\n\u201cYou would be shocked to learn a Standard\r\nSeven pupil cannot do simple calculations\r\nor read a paragraph.\u201d Uwezo-Kenya\u2019s coun\r\ntry director, Dr Sarah Ruto, told the Daily\r\n!Vation yesterday during the training of\r\nvolunteers to spearhead the exercise.\r\nThe study seeks to establish whether\r\nlearners merely attend school as a ritual\r\nor to acquire skills in reading, writing, lis\r\ntening and speaking.\r\nSo do car accidents occur because mo\r\ntorists cannot interpret road signs, and\r\n\u2018YoU would be shocked\r\nto learn that a Standard\r\nSeven pupil cannot do\r\nis a medication overdose an indicator of\r\none\u2019s level of illiteracy or ignorance?\r\nUwezo-Kenya has noted that though\r\nn\u00ecost learners attend school, their in\r\nability to recognise basic language skills\r\nis alarming.\r\nDr Ruto said the education census will\r\ngive a basic test that will require learners\r\nto read out letters of the alphabet, words,\r\nsentences and paragraphs and later an\r\nswer two comprehension questions.\r\nAccording to sample questions seen by\r\nthe Nation, the learners will be gauged\r\naccording to levels of difficulty of the sen\r\ntences they can read.\r\nSimple arithmetic and sentences like\r\n\u2018Our class went to the zoo: and \u2018Uwanja\r\nurnejaa watu\u2019 are examples of sentences\r\nin the questionnaires.\r\nThe 100-day study will involve school\r\nvisits and household counts to evaluate\r\nthe level of reading and writing of learn-\r\nLiteracy Day: An\r\nelderly woman,\r\nwho is a pupil at\r\nKapserton Adult\r\nBasic Education\r\nCentre in Nandi\r\nNorth District,\r\nwrites during\r\nthe International\r\nLiteracy Day on\r\nSeptember 8.\r\nAnew study is\r\nto be done to\r\ngauge tite level\r\nof understanding\r\namong Kenya\u2019s\r\nle ame rs.\r\nPhoto/JARED\r\nNYATA\r\ners in the current education system.\r\nDr Ruto said the exercise aims at pro\r\nviding information on the importance of\r\nlearners acquiring basic reading and writ\r\ning skills in order to succeed.\r\n\u2018We will administer a basic Standard Two\r\ntest to everyone at the letter, word, sentence\r\nand paragraph level to evaluate how much\r\nthey can understand,\u201d said Dr Ruto.\r\nflasic tests in English, Mathematies and\r\nKiswahili will be administered to pupils\r\nin over 72 districts and the results an\r\nnounced in January next year.\r\nProf Daniel Sifuna, a lecturer at Kenyat\r\nta Universit,; is worried that the quality of\r\neducation in the country does not match\r\ncurrent development trends.\r\nWe focus on the colonial curriculum\r\ninstead of upgrading to the present soci\r\netal needs.\u201d he said.\r\nAccording to the education expert, the\r\nquality education has been pegged to\r\npassing national examinations which he\r\ndescribed as a \u2018worrying trend:\r\nProf Sifuna warned that the focus on ex\r\namination results in developing countries\r\nthat encourages rote learning can be risky\r\nto a pupil\u2019s quality of learning.\r\n\u201cKenyans have neglected books, we\r\nneed to foster a reading culture,\u201d he said.\r\nThe thorough school system is currently\r\nunder keen study to ascertain whether pu\r\npils can relate what is learnt in school to\r\nwhat happens in the society\r\nIn Kenya, learners\u2019 abilities are deter\r\nmined through grades in their respective\r\nclasses and by terminal national exami\r\nnations.\r\nIn his book, Illiteracy, A World Prob\r\nkm. Jeffries Charles cites an example of\r\nan illiterate farmer who cannot interpret\r\nsimple instructions which could save his\r\ncrops from a disaster.\r\nNumerical skills\r\nThe national exercise targeting 72 dis\r\ntricts hopes to establish the learners\u2019 nu\r\nmerical skills and the ability to interpret\r\ninformation.\r\nThough literacy is a fundamental\r\nhuman right, the education experts were\r\nconcerned about its lack of impact in the\r\nlearners\u2019 decision making.\r\nA woman\u2019s level of education influenoes\r\ntheir decisions on HWand Aids and other\r\nreproductive health issues.\r\nThe Kenya National Examination coun\r\ncil applauded the study adding it would\r\nprovide an opportunity to review the cur\r\nrent education system.\r\nThe assessment would help in formulat\r\ning policies that would improve learning\r\nin schools countrywide, Knec boss Paul\r\nWasan, said.\r\nUtnth and Tanzania will carry out\r\na similar three-month study to evaluate\r\nwhether the problem is in the education\r\nsystem or with the learners themselves\r\nThe Sh50 million project is funded by\r\n1vaweza, an international organisation\r\nthat promotes learning through research\r\nto improve education trends.\r\nsimple calculations."}
