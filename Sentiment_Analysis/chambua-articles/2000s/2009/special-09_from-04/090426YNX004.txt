I\r\nwould not like young Kenyans who\r\nare leaders of tomorrow to die\r\nyoung. We are only morally upright\r\nwhen we do the will of God by\r\nnot engaging in pre-marital sex\r\nand keeping away from drugs.\r\nThe youth should focus on useful\r\nactivities like charity work and sports\r\nto keep off peer pressure that might\r\nlead them in the wrong direction"}
