{"text": "\ufeffDAILY NATION WEDNESDAY APRIL 15, 2009\r\n\r\nCHOLERA IS BACK ON THE SCENE\r\n\r\nCholera is an old disease that is once\r\nagain making the news, this time in\r\nthe western and northern parts of\r\nthe country. It is an acute infection of the\r\ngut characterised by profuse diarrhoea\r\nand vomiting that lead to dehydration,\r\nbody salt disturbances, leg cramps and\r\nshock. Without treatment, death can\r\noccur within hours.\r\nCholera is spread through\r\nconsumption of contaminated waterand\r\nfood. Cholera outbreaks are linked\r\nto multiple sources such as drinking\r\nriver and lake water, living in crowded\r\nconditions, eating at funeral or wedding\r\nfeasts, and consuming food or beverages\r\nfrom street vendors. The cholera germ\r\ncan survive refrigeration and freezing, so\r\nan infectious strain could travel far from\r\nits original location in food. The common\r\nhousefly has also been implicated in\r\noutbreaks, hence the importance of\r\nhygiene at home.\r\nAfter an incubation period of between\r\n18 hours and five days, symptoms appear\r\nabruptly and include watery diarrhoea\r\nand vomit. The most distinctive feature\r\nof cholera is the painless purging of\r\nstool that resembles rice-water and has\r\nsometimes been described as having\r\na fishy odour. Following a severe loss\r\nof water from the body, symptoms of\r\nsevere dehydration include poor skin\r\nturgidity, sunken eyes, wrinkled hands\r\nand feet, restlessness and extreme thirst.\r\nUnder-nourished infants, particularly\r\nthose suffering from deficiencies of\r\nzinc and vitamin A, appear to be more\r\nsusceptible to death from cholera. In\r\naddition, susceptibility or severity is\r\nworsened by the presence of other\r\ndiseases such as malaria or HIV and Aids.\r\nThe highest cholera attack rates are\r\nusually in children aged between two\r\nand four years; however, the illness is\r\ngenerally first seen in adults owing to\r\nexposure to contaminated food and\r\nwater. For unknown reasons, people of\r\nblood group O are at much higher risk\r\nof severe cholera infection. Miscarriage\r\nor premature delivery can occur in\r\npregnant women as a complication of\r\nshock and poor entry of nutrients to the\r\nplacenta following a cholera attack.\r\nPrevention includes ensuring a safe\r\nwater supply, improving sanitation and\r\nmaking food safe for consumption by\r\nthorough cooking of food. Without\r\ntreatment, the fatality rate for cholera\r\nis significant. However, treatment is\r\nvery effective and simple, based on the\r\nconcept of replacing fluids as fast as\r\nthey are being lost. Access to medication\r\n(antibiotics) can halve the duration of\r\nillness and lessen the diarrhoea to help\r\nreduce secondary transmission.\r\nDr Kamau Kinyenje\r\npointofcare@africaonline.co.ke"}
