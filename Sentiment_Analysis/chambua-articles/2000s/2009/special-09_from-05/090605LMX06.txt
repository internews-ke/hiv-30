{"text": "\ufeffDAILY NATION\r\nWEDNESDAY MAY 6, 2009\r\n\r\nLIVING POSITIVELY\r\nWhere things once seemed\r\nimpossible, now the future is\r\nlooking brighter than ever\r\nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother of two who\r\ntested positive 20 years ago. She is the executive director of\r\nthe Kenya Network of Women with Aids (KENWA).\r\nTowards the end of last year, I was able to experience\r\nand enjoy yet another achievement of my life. I escorted\r\nNyambura, my foster daughter, to the airport \u2013 she was\r\ngoing abroad to study. I felt like the happiest woman in the\r\nworld even though achievements such as this one never make\r\nthe headlines. I was happy because I knew I had struck just the\r\nright chord in Nyambura\u2019s heart.\r\nShe and I go way back and the history we share is a\r\nbittersweet one. She is the second last of six children and when\r\nI took her in, her biological mother had just died from HIVrelated\r\ncomplications. Actually, she died while they were asleep\r\ntogether.\r\nNyambura touched me because of her commitment to\r\nlooking after her mother. She cleaned her mother\u2019s soiled linen\r\nand even bathed her. She was the caregiver even though she\r\nwas still a minor and had no prior training in the basics of care\r\nand support of a person living with HIV. So when her mother\r\ndied, I took her as most of her other siblings went to the streets.\r\nSadly, we learnt later that some of them died of one cause or\r\nanother.\r\nI have since learnt that being a foster mother isn\u2019t\r\nnecessarily about having the wherewithal; it\u2019s about offering\r\na disadvantaged child security and comfort. It\u2019s about\r\nlooking past some of the superficial boundaries we erect and\r\nrecognising that children, regardless of where they come from,\r\nare a source of pride and joy.\r\nMoney for food\r\nWhen I took Nyambura in, I was broke, and had been that way\r\nfor quite some time. At one point I even thought I was biting off\r\nmore than I could chew. I rarely had enough money for food and\r\nrent. Sometimes I had to play cat and mouse games with my\r\nlandlord over accumulating rent arrears. I was living in an 11-\r\nby-11-foot single room in Kayole Estate, in Nairobi\u2019s Eastlands\r\narea. I remember referring to it as a \u2018self-confused\u2019 apartment\r\nbecause the room was everything rolled into one \u2013 our living\r\nroom, kitchen and dining room. At night, we moved some of our\r\nhousehold goods outside to create bedroom space.\r\nWhen she finished secondary school, Nyambura attended\r\na college in the city centre. However, that was not where her\r\nheart was. She dreamed of going abroad and then returning to\r\nhelp build her country with the knowledge she had acquired.\r\nThis looked like an impossible dream because I didn\u2019t have the\r\nmeans. But I am grateful that she was finally able to go to do it.\r\nThere was a time when even going to Form One was the\r\nbiggest challenge of my life. But nothing is impossible and I am\r\ngrateful to the well-wishers who helped me get a scholarship\r\nfor Nyambura. It just goes to show that even in my selfconfused\r\nstate, God had already created the way and all I had to\r\ndo was chin up and take this child under my wings.\r\nSmall token\r\nA few weeks ago my foster daughter sent me a little money,\r\nwhich I received with a lot of gratitude to God. The small token\r\ntaught me that I shouldn\u2019t stop having big dreams for my life,\r\neven when they seem to be out of reach. Many people give\r\nup when it seems like the stars aren\u2019t in alignment with their\r\ndesires or if their dreams require hundreds of thousands of\r\nshillings that they don\u2019t have.\r\nAll I can do this week, as we commemorate a day dedicated to\r\nmothers all over the world, is wish Nyambura all the best in life.\r\nI would like her to know I am overjoyed that I can now join the\r\nproud league of mothers who have sent their children abroad to\r\nstudy. I may not have helped many, but at least for Nyambura I\r\nhave made the difference between hope and helplessness.\r\nIt seems like just yesterday when we were slaving through\r\nthe rigours of life and wondering if we would get through one\r\nmore day safely. This is truly one of the joys of motherhood\r\n\u2013 seeing your child succeed in life and become something.\r\nFoster motherhood has accorded me the chance to share my\r\nparenting gifts and talents with others. As someone once said,\r\nservice to others is the rent we pay for our tenancy on God\u2019s\r\nearth.\r\nTo all the foster mums out there who have opened their\r\nhearts and homes to disadvantaged children, have a blessed\r\nMothers\u2019 Day.\r\nasuntawagura@hotmail.com\r\nPride and joy of\r\na foster mother"}
