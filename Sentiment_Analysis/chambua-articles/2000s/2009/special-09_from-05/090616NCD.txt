{"text": "\ufeffDAILY NATION\r\nTuesday June 16, 2009\r\n\r\nBy KITSEPILE NYATHI\r\nand Reuters\r\nGermany pledged 25 million euros\r\n($35 million) in aid to Zimbabwe\r\ntoday and Chancellor Angela\r\nMerkel said Berlin could provide\r\nmore support if the poverty-stricken\r\ncountry undertakes more democratic reforms.\r\nZimbabwe\u2019s Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai\r\nhas been touring Europe and the\r\nUS to try to convince donor countries that\r\nhis fragile unity government can rescue\r\nthe southern African country from economic\r\nand political chaos.\r\nGermany\u2019s Development minister\r\nHeidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul said Berlin\r\nwould contribute 20 million euros to a\r\nWorld Bank fund focused on promoting\r\ndemocracy in Zimbabwe, and another 5\r\nmillion euros for manure and seed.\r\nDemocratic reforms\r\nGermany now mainly provides humanitarian\r\naid to Zimbabwe.\r\nChancellor Merkel said she was ready\r\nto provide more comprehensive help if\r\nthe unity government set about creating\r\na constitution, undertaking land reform\r\nand establishing new state authorities.\r\nGermany could help with these democratic\r\nreforms, she added.\r\n\u201cMy expectation is that every success\r\nin the building of democratic structures\r\ncould potentially lead to more help. But\r\nthis need not be fi nancial help. It could\r\nalso be advice,\u201d Chancellor Merkel told\r\nreporters after meeting Mr Tsvangirai\r\nZimbabwe PM wins\r\nmore support as he\r\ncontinues visit to\r\nWestern capitals\r\nGermany to give Harare $35m\r\nin Berlin.\r\nWestern aid is only beginning to trickle\r\ninto Zimbabwe -- and all of it is bypassing\r\nthe unity government of Mr Tsvangirai\r\nand President Robert Mugabe.\r\nUS President Barack Obama on Friday\r\npromised $73 million in new aid that a\r\nWhite House offi cial said would go towards\r\nfi ghting HIV and Aids and promoting\r\ngood governance in the southern\r\nAfrican nation.\r\nSignifi cantly, the money will not go to\r\nthe government but will be channelled\r\nthrough aid agencies.\r\nChancellor Merkel said she could envisage\r\nGermany providing similar aid, targeted\r\nat equipping schools and hospitals.\r\nMr Tsvangirai said Zimbabwe needs\r\ncredit to revive its economy.\r\n\u201cWe have already made a number of\r\nstrides forward. I ask that that be noted,\u201d\r\nhe said, pointing to the re-opening of\r\nschools and hospitals and some success\r\nin reining in infl ation.\r\n\u201cWe need bridge loans now to rebuild\r\nour economy,\u201d he added.\r\nPolitical aims\r\nZimbabwe\u2019s unity government was formed\r\nby President Mugabe and Mr Tsvangirai\r\nin February but their power-sharing deal\r\nhas not been fully implemented.\r\nMr Tsvangirai\u2019s Movement for Democratic\r\nChange (MDC) has long accused\r\nPresident Mugabe\u2019s Zanu-PF of using violence\r\nto further its political aims, charges\r\nit denies. Arrests of MDC activists have\r\nstrained the new government.\r\nWestern donors have said aid will only\r\nfl ow when a democracy is created and\r\neconomic reforms are implemented.\r\nMeanwhile, a six-member IMF team is\r\nin Zimbabwe to assess progress in the reform\r\nof economic policies by the coalition\r\ngovernment and the country\u2019s humanitarian\r\ncrisis.\r\nThe mission, which becomes the third\r\nsince the formation of a coalition government\r\nin February, follows the IMFs decision\r\nlast month to resume technical assistance\r\nto Zimbabwe, which was stopped\r\na decade ago.\r\nThe head of the delegation jetted into\r\nthe country today while the rest of the\r\nteam began its meetings with Ministry of\r\nFinance offi cials last week on external domestic\r\ndebts, revenue and expenditure.\r\nDuring their stay, a series of high profi\r\nle meetings with government, banking,\r\nindustry and agricultural offi cials have\r\nbeen lined up.\r\nThe delegation is composed of Mr Vitaliy\r\nKramarenko (head of mission), Mr\r\nWouter Bossu, Mr Lars Engstrom, Mr\r\nGilda Fernandez, Mr Richard Hughes\r\nand Mr Denevieve Verdier.\r\nWill be scrutinised\r\nOn completion of their work on June 29,\r\nthe mission is expected to hold a report\r\nback meeting with Finance minister Mr\r\nTendai Biti, the Economic Planning and\r\nInvestment Promotion minister, Mr Elton\r\nMangoma, and the Central Bank governor,\r\nDr Gideon Gono.\r\nAccording to the missions work schedule,\r\nall sectors of the economy, including\r\nhealth, education, infrastructure and current\r\nfood situation will be scrutinised.\r\nDr Gonos continued stay at the RBZ,\r\nwhich has divided the coalition because\r\nof his loyalty to President Mugabe, will\r\nalso come under spotlight.\r\nThe IMF has in the past pointed out key\r\ngovernance weaknesses, including lack of\r\nenforcement of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe\r\nActs accountability requirements\r\nand non-compliance with the International\r\nFinancial Reporting Standards."}
