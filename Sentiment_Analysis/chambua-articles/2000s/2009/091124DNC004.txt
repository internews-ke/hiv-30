The campaign, which\r\nwill run for three weeks at health centres\r\ncountrywide, will end on December 12.\r\nIn a similar campaign last year, 700,000\r\npeople were tested.\r\nThe National Aids and STI Control Programme\r\nhead Nicholas Muraguri cited the\r\nyouth as the most vulnerable groups and\r\ncalled for vigorous campaigns to encourage\r\nthem to get tested.\r\nDr Muraguri pointed out that denial\r\nthat the youth are at risk was one of the\r\nbarriers in controlling new infections\r\namong those aged between 20 and 24\r\nyears. \u201cWomen are four times more at\r\nrisk of contracting HIV compared to their\r\nmale counterparts,\u201d Dr Muraguri told\r\nDaily Nation in an interview.\r\nThe HIV prevalence among women\r\nstood at 11 per cent compared to 3.9 per\r\ncent among men in the same age group.\r\nHowever, men were the most affected\r\ngroup after the age of 55, with an 8.3 per\r\ncent prevalence.\r\nMrs Mugo urged the youth to get tested\r\nto plan wisely for their families.\r\nShe further challenged the youth to involve\r\nthemselves in productive ventures\r\nto avoid boredom that later exposed them\r\nA million Kenyans\r\nexpected to know\r\ntheir HIV status\r\nduring campaign\r\nto risky sexual behaviour.\r\n\u201cWe expect to meet a target of 10 million\r\npeople tested by June next year,\u201d the\r\nminister said.\r\nAccording to the Kenya Aids Indicator\r\nSurvey, there was an increase in HIV\r\nawareness among those aged between 15\r\nand 49 years although two thirds had not\r\nbeen tested.\r\nThe minister called on those who had\r\ntested positive to maintain healthy lifestyles\r\nthrough diet, seeking medication\r\nand adopting behaviour change to avoid\r\ninfecting others and acquiring new strains\r\nof the virus.\r\n\u201cMake an informed choice and visit a\r\nVCT centre to plan your life wisely,\u201d she\r\nsaid. According to government statistics,\r\n45 per cent of people who got tested are\r\nin discordant relationships, thus making\r\ndifficult to monitor the spread pattern of\r\nthe disease if one of the partners refused\r\nto get tested."}
