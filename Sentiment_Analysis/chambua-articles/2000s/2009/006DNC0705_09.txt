Trials being
done on new
anti-HIV gels

BY NATION CORRESPONDENT
Scientist are conducting trials
on antiretroviral-based gels that
could protect women against HIV
during sex.
The substances, known as microbicides,
include vaginal gels,
rings and film that could help
stop the spread of HIV.
Speaking at a media workshop
organised by the National Aids
Control Council at the Kenya
School of Monetary Studies in
Nairobi, former Medical Women’s
Association secretary Pamela
Njuguna yesterday said the trials
are being conducted in Rwanda,
Zambia and South Africa.
More women affected
“Results are expected in 2014
and will be applicable in Kenya.
We shall await the results to move
to the next phase,” Dr Njuguna, a
health specialist, said.
She said some of the microbicides
being tested are designed
only for women as vaginal products
while others were rectal products
that both men and women could
use.
In Kenya and other sub-Saharan
countries, more women than men
are living with HIV, with experts
saying those aged 15 to 24 are at
least twice likely as young men to
be infected.
In Kenya, some 1.5 million people
are infected with HIV the virus
that causes Aids.
