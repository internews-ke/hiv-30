Before two people get\r\nmarried, medical test should be carried out to\t\ufb01nd out their status.\t\r\nWawire Makheti Clyde, 13, Bungoma DEB Primary S\tchool.\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\nHIV has a\ufb00ected life expectancy rates in Kenya.\tSpirituality is important. I must\r\n\t\t\r\nrelate to my God at all times and be honest and\tjoyful. I will join support groups that\r\nwill keep me focused and I will \ufb01nd out how I c\tan help children who are affected.\r\nBelinda Wele, 11, Gateway Junior Academy, Bungoma\t\r\n\t\t\r\nI know a young boy who was infected when he was\tcircumcised. One knife was\t\r\nused on several boys. When he got sick we were\tall shocked. Sadly people isolated\r\nhim and his family. Aids patients need love and\tcare.\t\r\n\r\nL. M., 11, Bonanza school, Embu\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\nI thank the media for highlighting the dangers\tof HIV/Aids continually. It is has\r\n\t\t\r\naffected Kenya\u2019s labour force and created orphans, widows and widowers.\t\r\n\t\t\r\nMichael Njaramba Murigi, 15, Kiambu High School\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\nLive your life as if all around you are positiv\te and avoid irresponsible behavior.\r\nIrresponsible sexually behavior can be avoided if one critically looks at it and\r\nrealizes that it has no advantages. Also never judge a book by its cover. I know a\r\nprostitute from Kibera who died with her young child but the gentleman who used to \r\ngo out with her is alive and looks healthy \ufb01ve years on but I know this does not\r\nmean he is not an HIV carrier.\t\t\r\n\t\t"}
