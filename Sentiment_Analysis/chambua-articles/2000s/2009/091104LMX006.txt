{"text": "\ufeffDAILY NATION\r\nWEDNESDAY NOVEMBER 4, 2009\r\n\r\nPeter is a unique case study in\r\nhoping against hope\r\n\r\nMy son, Peter, is among the more than\r\n300,000 Form Four students sitting for the\r\nKenya Certificate of Secondary Education\r\nexaminations this year. As I escorted him\r\nback to school the last time he came home, I could see\r\nhe had high hopes for the future. I didn\u2019t want to appear\r\npessimistic, but I wanted to tell him that it\u2019s always good\r\nto look at life with an open mind. Exams shouldn\u2019t be the\r\nbe all and end all.\r\nWhen we read the statistics \u2014 that is, 300,000-plus\r\nstudents doing exams annually \u2014 it\u2019s hard to place a\r\nface. But looking at Peter, I don\u2019t feel like he is just a\r\nnumber. He is struggle personified.\r\nPeter started school almost two years later than his\r\nage mates. \u201cLike me, he\u2019s HIV-infected and will be dying\r\nany time so what\u2019s the point of taking him to school?\u201d I\r\nreasoned at the time. But neither of us died and before I\r\nknew it, Peter was the only child who remained at home\r\nafter all the neighbouring children had gone to school.\r\nIt was then that \u201csneaked\u201d him into a nearby school. As\r\nI enrolled him, I prayed the headmistress would never\r\nknow about my HIV status. As it is, some neighbours\r\nbelieved I was \u201cdying of Aids\u201d rather than \u201cliving with\r\nHIV\u201d as we say nowadays.\r\n\u201cMy friends have refused to play with me because their\r\nparents have warned them that I\u2019m dying of Aids just like\r\nmy mother,\u201d my tearful son told me one day.\r\nI swallowed hard.\r\n\u201cThey say we\u2019re thin like people with Aids.\u201d\r\nTrue, we were thin and miserable \u2014 from the stress,\r\npain, stigma, hide-and-seek game and hate.\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a big difference between HIV and Aids,\u201d I tried\r\nto educate Peter.\r\n\u201cMum, are we going to die?\u201d\r\n\u201cAlthough I... we... have HIV, we\u2019re not going to die\r\nimmediately,\u201d I replied, almost echoing the matron who\r\nhad told me I had six months to live after I tested HIVpositive.\r\n\u201cDeath is an equal reaper. Besides, a person\r\nliving with HIV might die of causes other than Aids.\u201d\r\nThere were other questions I couldn\u2019t answer, like how\r\nI got infected HIV and why \u201cwe\u201d had Aids while the other\r\nchildren and their mothers didn\u2019t.\r\nI don\u2019t know how much Peter understood, but\r\nafter this he was able to handle the issues more\r\nknowledgeably. Plus, I was always there, ready to\r\nseparate the facts from the myths.\r\n\u201cThe neighbours are a bit malicious; your friends can\u2019t\r\nbe infected just by playing with you,\u201d I counselled him\r\nwhenever he was treated like a pariah.\r\n\u201cSurely, if Peter is actually HIV-positive, why can\u2019t\r\nthese mothers also consider my son\u2019s welfare?\u201d I\r\nwondered. \u201cAnd what about the other infected and\r\naffected children that these mothers don\u2019t know about?\r\nI don\u2019t know how the school headmistress learnt\r\nabout my status but she summoned me to school early\r\none morning. As I sat on the cold office bench waiting, I\r\nsensed it had everything to do with my HIV status.\r\n\u201cHow long will this demon haunt me?\u201d I moaned. \u201cIsn\u2019t\r\nthere an escape route? I regret the day I fell in love. God,\r\nPeter doesn\u2019t deserve this.\u201d\r\n\u201cMama Peter, I\u2019m sorry we can\u2019t keep your son in this\r\nschool because we are a profit-making institution,\u201d the\r\nheadmistress dropped the bombshell. \u201cIf other parents\r\nknow of your HIV status, they\u2019ll withdraw their children\r\nand I\u2019ll have no business. Please look for another school.\u201d\r\nWith that, she set the precedent for the next three\r\nschools: they all denied Peter entry. Just as I was losing\r\nhope, the fourth school accepted him, and that\u2019s where\r\nPeter completed primary school.\r\nThat\u2019s why I believe Peter isn\u2019t just another statistic.\r\nHe\u2019s a unique case study in hoping against hope. And I\r\nknow thousands of other candidates have their individual\r\nstories of struggle.\r\nAll the best, survivors.\r\nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother of two\r\nwho tested positive more than 20 years ago. She is the\r\nexecutive director of the Kenya Network of Women\r\nwith Aids (KENWA)."}
