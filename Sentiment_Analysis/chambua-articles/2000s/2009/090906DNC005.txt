{"text": "\ufeffSUNDAY NATION September 6, 2009\r\n\r\nnine years are hooked to pornography\r\n\r\nBy DANIEL WESANGULA\r\nand JOHN MAKENI\r\nSome unscrupulous backstreet fi lmmakers\r\nwho have been churning out potboilers\r\nhave turned to shooting pornographic\r\nfi lms.\r\nThey are producing DVDs in local languages\r\nwhich are on sale in all major\r\ntowns in the country.\r\nAs a result, religious leaders are up in\r\narms saying the DVDs are eroding young\r\npeople\u2019s morals.\r\nTraditionally, public discussion of sex\r\nhas generally been taboo, but the subject\r\nhas been turned into a profi table trade\r\nunder the noses of law enforcement offi -\r\ncials who have either been compromised\r\nto look the other way or are overwhelmed\r\nby the sheer volumes.\r\nAlthough sale of pornographic DVDs\r\nis illegal under Kenyan law, the fi lms are\r\non sale in public places at between Sh500\r\nand Sh2,000.\r\nMen and women, some as young as 17\r\nyears, have been lured into the business\r\nwith the promise of acting or modelling\r\ncareers, the Sunday Nation has established.\r\nThey earn between Sh5,000 and\r\nSh45,000 to engage in sex on camera.\r\nAccording to a report commissioned by\r\nthe ministry of Finance, the Kenyan fi lm\r\nindustry is worth about Sh4 billion, and it\r\nemploys about 15,000 people. A sizeable\r\nnumber of these are in the pornography\r\nbusiness.\r\nIncreasing openness\r\nSociologists link the increase in demand\r\nfor pornography to many factors, including\r\nthe increasing openness of the Kenyan\r\nsociety.\r\n\u201cSocial change is occurring all over the\r\nworld and we in Kenya will not be exempted,\u201d\r\nsaid John Murimi, a sociologist at the\r\nUniversity of Nairobi. \u201cWhat matters is\r\nhow we handle this new-found freedom.\u201d\r\nBut the clergy are very concerned about\r\nthe trend.\r\n\u201cThe tolerance of such materials shows\r\nonly one thing \u2014 that people cannot exercise\r\nself-control. We have let ourselves\r\ndown both physically and spiritually,\u201d said\r\nFather Francis Mbuthia, a Roman Catholic\r\npriest at the Holy Family Basilica. \u201cI am\r\nparticularly fearful for the future of the\r\nyouth. If this continues, where will we be\r\nin a few generations?\u201d\r\nFr Mbuthia said that if the spread of\r\npornography goes unchecked, the country\r\nmight be facing a \u201cspiritual breakdown\u201d.\r\nInvestigations by the Sunday Nation\r\nfound that some strip joints that once\r\npassed themselves off as massage parlours\r\nhave moved to the suburbs and revised\r\ntheir menu to include pornography.\r\nAn owner of one of these \u201cparlours\u201d told\r\nthe Sunday Nation that for the right price\r\n\u2014 Sh2,000 for one girl and Sh5,000 for\r\nfi ve \u2014 a client can \u201crent\u201d the number of\r\nwomen he wants for an agreed duration\r\nBut if video cameras are involved, an additional\r\nfee has to be negotiated with both\r\nthe owner and the girl or girls.\r\nBesides operating as brothels, many of\r\nthe \u201cmassage parlours\u201d are also production\r\nsites for pornographic videos.\r\nThey are located in Karen and Kitisuru\r\nas well as in Komarock, Buru Buru,\r\nUmoja, Ngara and in River Road in downtown\r\nNairobi.\r\nAccording to our sources, earnings for\r\nan actor in a local pornographic fi lm depend\r\non the length of the video or the\r\nnature of the acts, which can even involve\r\nanimals. The naive earn as little as\r\nSh5,000 per fi lm.\r\nAlthough HIV/Aids spread is on the increase\r\nlocally, safe sex is not a central feature\r\nin these fi lms, and actors are seldom\r\nasked about their HIV status.\r\nOne source, who requested anonymity\r\nto protect her four-year-old son from\r\nknowing what she does for a living, said\r\nshe does it because, with her secondary\r\nschool education, this is the only job that\r\ncan provide a livelihood for her and her\r\nchildren.\r\nWorking in brothels is not the only way\r\nyoung women are lured into the pornography\r\nindustry.\r\nInvestigations have shown that some\r\nso-called movie casting agencies operate\r\nas briefcase modelling agencies that exist\r\nfor the sole purpose of furnishing recruit\r\nactors for the illegal fi lms.\r\nThe agencies then create groups on social\r\nnetworking sites where models and\r\nactors are updated on dates and types\r\nof upcoming projects and the money involved.\r\nMarketing the fi lms involves mass market\r\ntactics such as distributing fl yers and\r\nputting posters in back streets which, according\r\nto the Nairobi City Council Licensing\r\nDepartment, is illegal.\r\n\u201cIt is against the law for anyone to paste\r\nposters of any nature on walls in the city\r\nsince we do not provide licences for such\r\nkind of advertising,\u201d said David Gatimu,\r\nthe assistant director for urban planning\r\nand development at the Nairobi City\r\nCouncil.\r\nAlthough the Kenya Film Censorship\r\nBoard operates under legislation adopted\r\nby the colonial government, it says it will\r\nwin the war against indecency. But this\r\ncould be a tall order for the parastatal\r\nsince the porn kings have moved into cyberspace\r\nwhere the board may have limited\r\npowers.\r\nThrough M-Pesa\r\nOne Internet site allows the client to select\r\na DVD, pay through M-Pesa and the item\r\nis delivered within minutes, in addition to\r\nqualifying for \u201cbonus points\u201d.\r\nThe chief executive of the censorship\r\nboard David Pkosing admitted that some\r\nof the people in the porn movie business\r\nappear to be untouchable by the police or\r\nother law enforcement agencies.\r\n\u201cWe are not short-handed. Provided the\r\namendments we have recommended for\r\nour current Act are made, the producers,\r\nconsumers and distributors of these fi lms\r\nwill be apprehended,\u201d he said.\r\n\u201cAs a board we cannot do much because\r\nthe laws are specifi c, and we are only entitled\r\nto deal with the fi nal product: the\r\nexhibitors. Pornography is a serious issue\r\nin this country, and the law should be\r\namended to give the board monitoring\r\npower besides dealing with exhibitors,\u201d\r\nhe added."}
