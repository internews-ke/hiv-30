Coastal women threatening
to strip over
teenage use of narcotics
may not just
be crying wolf; new evidence
indicates that abusers share
not only needles but possibly
their blood.
Called flash blood, it is a
cash-saving technique where
a user injects himself with heroin
or other illicit substances
and then draws a syringe full
of blood which he passes to a
second user to inject himself.
Flashing blood
The practice was fi rst detected
in Dar es Salaam two years ago
and it is suspected that youths
along the Kenyan coast were
now using it.
“An abnormally high rate of
HIV and hepatitis infection
among injecting drug users
at the Kenyan coast points to
‘fl ashing of blood’ among local
users,” says Dr Timothy Mugusia,
who has just completed a
new study on drug abuse in
Mombasa and Kilindini districts.
The study, sponsored by the National
Aids Control Council and
carried out by DARAT, a Mombasa-
based non-governmental
organisation in February, says a
sample of 120 narcotic users including
injectors in Mombasa
and Kilindini districts indicated
an exceptionally high prevalence
of hepatitis C and HIV infections.
“Over 70 per cent of them were
found to be infected with hepatitis
C while half of them were
HIV positive,” Dr Mugusia told
the Nation.
High prevalence
Several women in Mombasa
have threatened to strip publicly
unless the government
moved fast to arrest the escalating
narcotics use among the
youth in the region.
The women argue that
the drugs compromised the
youth’s capacity to engage in
either productive or reproduction
activities. And, Dr Mugusia
says the increased use of
injecting drugs and sharing
of needles will further complicate
the problem of drug abuse
at the Coast.
The study, A Rapid Assessment
of Injecting Drug use
in Mombasa and Kilindini
Districts, identifi ed 40 sites,
called maskani in the users’
language, where the teenagers
meet to share drugs.
According to the study,
while bhang is still a popular
drug it is quickly being overtaken
by injected heroin with
70 per cent of the respondents
saying they use it.
The fi rst incidents of “fl ash
blood” were reported by researchers
Sheryl McUrdy of
the University of Texas in the
US and Paul Kilonzo of the
University of Dar es Salaam in
Tanzania in a study published
in the African Journal of Drug
& Alcohol Studies in 2006.
Those who get the secondary
injection, explains Dr Mugusia,
believe they will get a
“high” because the originator
had injected heroin into their
blood. But this he says can
only give a very low satisfaction
because of the possible
low concentration of the drug
component.
The study found that most
of the users and those addicted
to be in their early 20s. “In
our study area of Mombasa
and Kilindini,” says Dr Mugusia,
“we estimate there are
over 6,000 drug injectors.”
