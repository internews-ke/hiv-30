{"text": "\ufeffThursday, December 3, 2009 | DAILY MONITOR \r\n\r\nBy Beatrice Wanja\r\nKampala\r\n\r\nAlthough the mobile money\r\nphenomenon is still young,\r\nthe World Bank in Africa has\r\nlabeled it a \u201ccornerstone for\r\ndevelopment\u201d because of its\r\npotential to mobilise remote\r\nrural economies. Already\r\nmobile phones have transformed\r\nthe lives of people in\r\ndeveloping countries hence\r\nthe mobile money service\r\ncould have an even bigger\r\nimpact on these people and\r\ntheir small businesses.\r\nBy using mobile money\r\nservices, millions are breaking\r\na technology barrier that\r\nremains in Europe and the\r\nUnited States, and paving\r\nway to what could be the\r\ncash of the future.\r\nMobile phones have\r\nevolved in a few years to\r\nbecome tools of economic\r\nem powerment.These phones\r\ncompensate for inadequate\r\nin frastructure, such as bad\r\nroads and slow postal services,\r\nallowing information to\r\nmove more freely, making\r\nmarkets more efficient and\r\nunleashing entrepreneurship.\r\nAccording to Mr Elly Kamugisha,\r\na trade and development\r\nexpert, with mobile\r\nphones now so common\r\nplaced, a new opportunity\r\nhas been created for\r\nentrepreneurs especially in\r\nthe SME sector to thrive via\r\nmobile money, which allows\r\ncash to travel as quickly as a\r\ntext message.\r\nEntrepreneurs and development\r\norganisations are\r\neagerly seizing the opportunity\r\npresented by such\r\ngrowth. They are creating\r\nmobile phone applications\r\nfor profitable and nonprofit\r\nventures across the board.\r\nSince mobile money transfer\r\nwas launched in Uganda\r\nmonths ago, millions of\r\npeople have embraced the\r\ninnovation to better their businesses.\r\nAmong the many businesspeople\r\nwho have taken advantage\r\nof the rapid telecom technological\r\nadvancements to\r\nimprove the efficiency in business\r\nrunning, is Mr Charles\r\nMubiru a businessman dealing\r\nin fruits and groundnuts at\r\nNakasero market. He buys\r\nall his fresh supplies upcountry\r\nand sometimes as far as\r\nKenya.\r\nHis business is five years old\r\nand Mr Mubiru says it (his\r\nbusiness) is set for a revolution\r\ngiven the boost the business\r\ncommunity has received\r\nfrom telecommunication companies,\r\nafter the introduction\r\nof Money Transfer services.\r\n\u201cI no longer need to carry\r\nmoney in the pocket or line\r\nup in banking halls to make\r\ntransactions,\u201d he says.\r\n\u201cA phone dial is enough for\r\nme to transfer money to my\r\nupcountry agents who buy the\r\nfruits. I also pay my transporters\r\nthrough the phone.\u201d\r\nTo make his business more\r\nefficient Mr Mubiru operates\r\nboth MTN and Safaricom mobile\r\nmoney transfer services.\r\n\u201cI use the two services because\r\nmy suppliers in Kenya\r\nmight need money urgently,\r\nwhich I have to send on time\r\nor my goods especially apples\r\nwhich are on high demand\r\nwill be sold to my competitor\r\nwho has ready cash,\u201d he\r\nexplains.\r\nMr Mubiru reloads his Safaricom\r\nMpesa account every\r\none week within Kampala\r\nor whenever he travels to\r\nNairobi for his goods. He says\r\nthat he cannot use the MTN\r\naccount to pay his Kenyan\r\nsuppliers because it is yet\r\nto start working across the\r\nborder.\r\nThe service has proven to be\r\nimportant and people particularly\r\nfrom the busi\r\nMobile phones have evolved in\r\na few years to become tools of\r\neconomic em powerment.These\r\nphones compensate for inadequate\r\nin frastructure, such as bad\r\nroads and slow postal services,\r\nallowing information to move\r\nmore freely, making markets\r\nmore efficient and unleashing\r\nentrepreneurship.\r\nA businessman dealing in matooke\r\nin Kampala for example,\r\nwill have no need of travelling to\r\nthe countryside to buy matooke.\r\nThe only thing he needs is to\r\nuse a phone to send money to an\r\nagent who can do that (buying)\r\nfor him. This makes the product\r\nsafe in this era when accidents\r\nand theft are rampant making\r\ntravelling with loads of money\r\nrisky.\r\nMTN Publicist,\r\nMs Sheila Kangwagye\r\nsays the\r\nMobile Money\r\nsystem is efficient\r\nin its self,\r\nand that is why\r\nit can manage to\r\nmake transactions \u201cin real time.\u201d\r\n\u201cIt has a self audit system to\r\ntrack every single transaction,\u201d\r\n\u201cCarrying out a transaction\r\nshould take you under three minutes\r\nassuming you have money\r\non your account, however, the\r\nMobile Money platform is dependent\r\non SMS and the network\r\nin general, so any interference in\r\nthat area may affect its performance.\u201d\r\nNot only is the service fast,\r\ncheap and efficient, there is no\r\nlimit in the number of transactions\r\nthat need to be executed in\r\na day.\r\nMr Moses Kalungi, an MTN\r\nservice agent along Kampala\r\nRoad says that the service that is\r\nhardly half a yearold\r\nand it has\r\nregistered success. He however\r\nsays instances of network\r\nbreakdown at times compel\r\nclients to wait for a little longer\r\nbefore making their transactions.\r\nTo make business even\r\nsimpler and more effective,\r\nplans are underway to turn\r\nmobile money into a global\r\nventure.\r\nAs MTN\u2019s Marketing\r\nManager, Mr Isaac Nsereko\r\nrevealed this development will\r\nonly serve to widen the mobile\r\nmoney transfer market and also\r\nboost MTN\u2019s presence in the\r\nmarket.\r\nIt is a faster, cheaper and safer\r\nway to transfer money than\r\nthe alternatives, such as slow,\r\ncostly transfers via banks and\r\npost offices, or handing an envelope\r\nof cash to a bus driver. Rather\r\nthan spend a day travelling by bus\r\nto the nearest bank, recipients in\r\nrural areas can spend their time\r\ndoing other things that add to their\r\nproductivity. Mobile money also\r\nprovides a stepping stone to formal\r\nfi nancial services for people who\r\nlack access to savings accounts,\r\ncredit and insurance. Although for\r\nregula tory reasons mobile money\r\naccounts do not pay interest, the\r\nservice is used by some people as a\r\nsavings account.\r\nHaving even a small cushion\r\nof savings to fall back on allows\r\npeople to deal with unexpected expenses,\r\nsuch as medical treatment,\r\nwith out having to sell a cow or\r\ntake a child out of school. Mobile\r\nbanking is safer than storing wealth\r\nin the form of cattle (which can\r\nbecome diseased and die), in neighbourhoods\r\nsavings schemes (which\r\nmay be fraud ulent) or by stuffing\r\nbanknotes into a mattress.\r\nMobile money presents a shining\r\nopportunity to start a sec ond wave\r\nof mobileled\r\ndevelopment across\r\nthe developing world. Operators,\r\nbanks and regulators should\r\nseize it.\r\nAccording to Ms Winfrey\r\nKatto, a Zain agent in Wandegeya,\r\ncarrying out a transaction\r\ncomes with a cost depending on\r\nthe amount one intends to send or\r\nwithdraw.\r\n\u201cThough we charge a fee for all\r\ntransaction, many clients don\u2019t\r\nmind because it is cheaper than\r\nusing banking services,\u201d Ms\r\nKatto explainsd\r\n\u201cMobile handsets are in an\r\nexcellent position to become\r\nthe primary digital channel for\r\nproviders of banking and related\r\nfinancial services in emerging\r\nmarkets,\u201d Mr Kamugisha says.\r\nThe scope of the mobile money\r\nsystems has grown quickly from\r\nsimple cash transfers by text message\r\nto payments for everything\r\nfrom a salon visit to a utility bill,\r\nand it is possible to spend a day\r\nwithout carrying cash around.\r\nBeyond simple profit, Mr Yesse\r\nOenga, the Zain Uganda Managing\r\nDirector says the real value of\r\nmobile cash to phone firms lies in\r\nsecuring a longterm\r\nconnection\r\nwith customers as cutthroat\r\ncompetition in the mobile\r\nmarket eats into revenues.\r\n\u201cWe see it as a tool to create\r\nstickiness,\u201d Mr Oenga says.\r\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s a revenue service\r\nbut at the cost of an SMS,\r\nyou\u2019re not going to get rich\r\nquickly.\u201d\r\nThe service has also allowed\r\nmoney to penetrate more easily\r\ninto rural areas where it\u2019s\r\nreally needed.\r\nMs Gemima Namubiru is\r\nsomeone whose life has become\r\nmuch more manageable\r\nbecause of mobile money.\r\nShe is 70years\r\nold and\r\nsomehow manages to maintain\r\nher small family farm in\r\nMbarara.\r\nLike other people living off\r\nthe land and a small number\r\nof livestock, she is dependent\r\non money earned by a close\r\nrelative, far away in an urban\r\ncentre.\r\nA weekly SMS message\r\nfrom her daughter in Kampala\r\nnegates what she used\r\nto experience long\r\ndelays\r\nand sometimes the non arrival\r\nof cash brought by relatives,\r\nfriends or informal couriers.\r\nMs Namubiru is not in top\r\nform health but she can use\r\nher mobile phone walk to\r\nthe nearest trading centre to\r\ncash in her SMS transfers at\r\nthe local shop which acts as\r\nan agent for the service. Back\r\nin Kampala, her daughter,\r\nIrene, works as a lowly paid\r\nvoluntary assistant for a HIVAids\r\nclinic and is relieved not\r\nto face the trouble and cost\r\nof the threehour\r\nweekly bus\r\njourney to her mother\u2019s home.\r\n\u201cI used to send money with\r\nfriends or relatives or sometimes\r\nanyone who I thought\r\nwould be reliable,\u201d she said.\r\n\u201cBut so often, money used to\r\nget stolen or lost.\u201d"}
