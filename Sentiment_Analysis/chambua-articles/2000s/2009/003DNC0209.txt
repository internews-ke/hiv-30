WORLD AIDS DAY
WHEN VIRUS WAS AS GOOD AS SUICIDE

By JOY WANJA
She bubbles with enthusiasm and
wears a broad smile everyday,
thanks to her daughter, who was 12
at a time she contemplated suicide.
Ms Jane Aida, 40, tested positive to HIV
in 2001 and harboured suicidal thoughts,
but her daughter encouraged her to be positive
to see her three children grow up.
Today, she is grateful for her daughter,
Vivianne. And she draws her strength
from the red ribbon that symbolises the
fight against Aids.

The single mother of three contemplated
suicide to escape from stigma and discrimination
that was then associated with
people living with HIV.
“A death sentence had been handed
down, and I felt I did not deserve to live
a minute longer,” Ms Aida remembers
thinking as she wrote her will.
Two years shy of a decade today, Ms
Aida is full of optimism for life, and is a
mentor and crusader in the HIV and Aids
war. In her funeral plans, she thought
about having a special coffin to mark the
end of her four-decades of life.
Ms Aida, a support staff at the Kenyatta
National Hospital, owes her life today
to her daughter, now aspiring to join the
university and study psychology. Vivianne
Momanyi, 20, sat the KCSE exams this
year at Le Pic Secondary School.
“I looked at her innocent eyes and humble
plea, then swore I was going to live for
her,” Ms Aida says.
Trouble, she says, began when her partner
passed away in 2000. She had no idea
about the illness he had succumbed to, as
doctors never disclosed.
A year after his death, she sought medical
attention and was diagnosed as HIVShe
could have
committed suicide
11 years ago,
were it not for her
daughter. Ms Jane

with HIV since
then, and talked

A death sentence had
been handed down, and
I didn’t deserve to live
a minute longer. (But) I
looked at her eyes and
humble plea and swore I
was going to live for her
positive, a status she says was both unexpected
and scary.
The initial results revealed that her CD4
count was low, which prompted medics to
immediately place her on anti-retroviral
therapy. A normal CD4 count in a man
without HIV infection is between 400 to
1200 cells per cubic millimetre of blood,
and 500 to 1600 in women.
CD4 count is a marker of likely disease
progression. Initially in HIV infection
there is a sharp drop in the CD4 count,
as the immune system is being damaged
by HIV.
Doctors counsel that if one’s count falls
below 250, then treatment of ARVs is initiated
to boost the body’s immunity and
prevent it form further infections.
“But after I talked to a friend, she encouraged
me to deal with denial and
all else would be bearable,” she told the
Nation yesterday during celebrations to
mark the World Aids Day at KNH.
The mother of two girls and a boy aged
between 16 and 22 asks parents to be open
not only on issues pertaining to Aids but
also sex and relationships to block, especially
teens, from wrong information.
Twelve months after she tested positive,
Ms Aida went public about her status to
create awareness amongst her colleagues
on the importance of knowing their status
and adopting a healthy attitude.
At one time during her medication, she
abandoned the ARVs and opted for traditional
medicine, which she says led to a
fast deterioration of her health before she
was put on the second line of ARVs.
Today she is part of a team of 40 health
staff at KNH that have united to discuss
and empower colleagues in the hospital
and the public.
Kenstaff, she says, comprises doctors,
nurses, technicians, and support staff
amongst other health workers also affected
by the disease.
She has discussed her status with all
her children.
As Kenya marked a decade today of
managing HIV as a national disaster,
persons living with HIV like Ms Aida are
grateful that the fight has intensified and
the rate of infections has declined.
Based on this year’s theme, Universal
Access and Human Rights, global leaders
pledged to work towards universal HIV
and Aids prevention, treatment and care.
They made a call to recognise this right as
a fundamental human right.
