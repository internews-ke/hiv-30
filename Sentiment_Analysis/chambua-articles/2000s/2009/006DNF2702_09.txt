Saliva-based HIV test
set to be introduced

By GATONYE GATHURA
A new HIV/Aids testing kit
using saliva instead of blood
will soon be introduced in
public health centres.
It will involve collecting saliva
samples instead of blood
samples and it will take 20
minutes for the results to be
known.
“We are sorting out some technical
details and hope to roll
out a national campaign within
six months from now,” said
Dr Nicholas Muraguri, a director
with the National Aids/STD
Control Programme.
The new development, he
said, is one of several strategies
Nascop is using to reach
UN targets for universal HIV
knowledge status.
New technology
“Currently only about 35 per
cent of adult Kenyans know
their HIV status. We plan to
raise this to 80 per cent by
next year.”
Saliva-based test is a relatively
new technology, but one
which is already in use in most
developed countries. In the
continent, it is being applied
in South Africa, Ghana, and
Mauritius.
“Initially we plan to use the
technology alongside existing
ones, a factor that could
further improve on accuracy,
speed and safety,” said Dr Muraguri.
The test, made by Calypte
Biomedical Corporation of the
US, provides results within 20
minutes with 99 per cent accuracy.
Previous rapid HIV tests
require blood samples.
Where used, research indicates
it has proved cheaper and
reduces the risk of accidental
HIV transmission to health
personnel.
The new test involves wiping
a swab along the gums
and placing it into a liquid in
the testing device. When antibodies
to the HIV virus are
detected, there will be a colour
change on the device.
Although it is only available
at approved hospitals
and major clinics, as happens
elsewhere, it will eventually be
available in commercial pharmacies.
“But we have to consider
how patients might react to
the results at home, without
health-care workers on hand
to counsel them, and what to
do for confirmation in case
they get false results,” said the
director. The low viral concentration
in saliva explains why it
can be used to detect HIV, but
is not an agent for transmitting
the virus.
The test provides
results within 20
minutes with 99
per cent accuracy
