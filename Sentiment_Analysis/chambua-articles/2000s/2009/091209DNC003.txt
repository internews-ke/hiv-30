His son has\r\njust undergone a safe and\r\npainless circumcision.\r\nEleven-year-old Job Ochieng\u2019 used a\r\nnew sterilised tool, now in the pharmaceutical\r\nmarket.\r\n\u201cI looked for an option that involved no\r\nopen wounds, and had a shorter healing\r\nperiod, so he could return to playing as\r\nsoon as possible,\u201d Mr Ogada told the Nation\r\nat the Kenya Bureau of Standards offices\r\nyesterday.\r\nGurcharan Singh\r\nMr Ogada should thank Dr Gurcharan\r\nSingh, who devoted 20 years of his life to\r\nthe development of the Tara-Klamp.\r\nDr Gurcharan had earlier come faceto-\r\nface with young boys suffering from\r\nhorrible infections because of poorly\r\nperformed circumcisions. He travelled\r\naround the world searching for better circumcision\r\nmethods.\r\nHe found none, and concluded that a\r\ncleaner, safer method of circumcision had\r\nto be developed. In 1996, when he won a\r\nGold Medal in Geneva, the whole world\r\ntook notice of his simpler, hygienic and\r\nefficient way of circumcision.\r\nCircumcision is generally performed\r\neither in a surgical theatre, at home or\r\nas in Kenya, in the bush. But it often\r\ncomes with problems \u2014 infections, accidental\r\namputations of the glans penis,\r\nand bleeding among others. Most of these\r\nproblems occur because in all the circumcision\r\nmethods so far, the operation is of\r\ninvasive type.\r\nTara-Klamp, a relatively inexpensive\r\nplastic circumcision device, is designed\r\nfor non-hospital environments. It is a\r\nsingle use sterilised tool that comes in all\r\nsizes from infant to adult. It was invented\r\nin Malaysia.\r\nIt works by clamping off the foreskin\r\nwhere it meets the shaft of the penis.\r\nThe two arms or levers of the clamp are\r\nbrought closer to the locking mechanisms\r\non the tube until two clicks are heard to\r\nascertain that the locking is secure.\r\nNo dressings are applied, and under petroleum\r\njelly lubricants and anaesthetic\r\nonly, the device is locked in place, crushing\r\na ring of tissue as well as cutting off\r\nblood supply to the foreskin, which is then\r\npainlessly cut off. The Tara-Klamp is left\r\non for four to seven days.\r\nThe method reduces cross infections of\r\nsay, HIV between circumciser and the circumcised\r\nin cultural rites.\r\nHowever, in case the size is incorrect,\r\nthe tight grip could result to injuries to the\r\nclamped part. It costs about Sh1,200 exclusive\r\nof other services like anaesthesia,\r\nwhich could easily double or even triple\r\nthe cost, depending on the clinic.\r\nYesterday, the national standards regulator\r\nsaid the approval for its use in government\r\nhospitals was at the final stages;\r\nprivate clinics already use Tara-Klamp.\r\nIts chief supplier in Kenya, Bradmon\r\nHealthcare Limited, says men are warming\r\nup to the procedure, with 100 so far\r\ncircumcised, mainly in Nyanza and Western\r\nprovinces. Researchers say male circumcision\r\nreduces the risk of HIV infection\r\nby up to 60 per cent. So far, 60,000\r\nKenyans have been circumcised as part of\r\nHIV prevention.\r\nThe Kenya Aids Indicator Survey of\r\n2007 puts the number of uncircumcised\r\nmales aged 15-49 years at 1.2 million, with\r\nhealth officials estimating that for health\r\nimpact in the prevention and control of\r\nHIV and Aids, at least 1.1 million of these\r\npeople will have to be circumcised.\r\nAccording to Mr Titus Oyoo, a Kebs officer,\r\nTara-Klamp is undergoing final quality\r\ntests and is expected to be rolled out to\r\npublic hospitals. Common problems are\r\nprevented because the surgery is of noninvasive\r\ntype, says Mr Charles Nyakure,\r\na clinical officer who performs the procedure\r\nin his private clinic.\r\nThe procedure on Job was done on November\r\n25, and the Tara-Klamp removed\r\nfive days later, his father, Mr Ogada, said."}
