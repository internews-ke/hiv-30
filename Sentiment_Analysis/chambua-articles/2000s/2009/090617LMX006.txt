{"text": "\ufeffDAILY NATION\r\n\r\nWEDNESDAY JUNE 17, 2009\r\n\r\nHow I wish he were still here so\r\nhe could see how far I\u2019ve come\r\n\r\nLIVING POSITIVELY\r\nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother of two who\r\ntested positive 20 years ago. She is the executive director of\r\nthe Kenya Network of Women with Aids (KENWA).\r\nIt\u2019s been 22 years since my father passed away and I still\r\ndon\u2019t have words to describe the emptiness left by his death.\r\nI was reminded of him last week when a girl came to see\r\nme in my office, accompanied by her father. I was green with\r\nenvy as daughter introduced dad. The girl wanted her father to\r\nwitness as she made a donation to KENWA. You can\u2019t imagine\r\nhow much this made me miss you, Dad. I wished you could\r\nhave stood beside me too.\r\nThe incident made me think of the role fathers play in our\r\nlives, even though we sometimes take them for granted.\r\nIn particular I remembered how you always cheered me\r\non whenever I was on the verge of giving up. It was your\r\nencouragement that fuelled and accelerated me towards my\r\ndreams.\r\nThe reason I don\u2019t give up easily now is because you taught\r\nme that the only thing to do when everything fails is to try\r\nagain. I have applied this all along, and it works. But when I try\r\nto tell my son, Peter, the same, he looks at me as if I\u2019m from the\r\nStone Age. I\u2019m sure with time he will come to appreciate that\r\nnothing good comes easily.\r\nPretty tough\r\nDad, things have been pretty tough. Insecurity is increasing by\r\nthe day. Recently there was a massacre in Mathira, where your\r\ngrandfather came from. In one incident, the killers hacked a\r\nwoman as TV cameras rolled, and dared anyone to take her to\r\nhospital.\r\nThat was very painful for me because I\u2019ve seen HIV-related\r\nillnesses take parents away from children. I never imagined\r\nanybody in their right mind would want to add to the statistics\r\nof orphans. I didn\u2019t sleep that night. I remembered how it was\r\nhard losing you even as we prayed for a miracle.\r\nDad, a lot of things have changed: some good, others not\r\nso good. Can you imagine we now buy sugar at more than\r\n10 times the price it was when you were still with us? It has\r\nbecome very hard for the common man to fit in today\u2019s\r\neconomy.\r\nMaize flour, among other things, has reached prices that\r\nwere hard to even imagine. The people I serve can\u2019t afford two\r\nsquare meals a day. And without food, they\u2019re as good as dead\r\nbecause this virus requires good nutrition, plus drugs and a\r\nsound social support system, to keep it at bay.\r\nBack to college\r\nThe good news is I went to back to college. And I was reading\r\nthe other day that the price of a hamburger \u2013 which one can\r\nwolf down in five minutes flat \u2013 is \u00a31.5. That\u2019s about Sh190,\r\nand in Kenya it takes 38 hours to earn that amount of money!\r\nDo you think my two sons and I will survive this, Dad?\r\nIt\u2019s hard, especially for people living with HIV. I know I\u2019m\r\n100 times better, but it\u2019s still hard to enjoy a square meal\r\nwhen you know someone somewhere is starving to death, and\r\nsometimes just next door.\r\nOur politics have also changed a lot. For the political class,\r\nit\u2019s everyone for himself and God for the common person. I\r\nwish I could tell them the hyena\u2019s story you used to tell me.\r\nYou always concluded that no matter how greedy or hungry a\r\nhyena is, it would never eat its own child. Meaning when you\u2019re\r\na leader, no matter how greedy you are, you should never\r\nforget those who are supposed to be serving.\r\nI wish I could tell them, the way you used to tell us, that no\r\nmatter how hungry you are, you can only eat the capacity of\r\nyour stomach. You don\u2019t need more than what your stomach\r\ncan carry at any given time. I wish we could all apply this and\r\ngive the surplus to the needy. And I wish I could repeat what\r\nyou used to say: \u201cIt is good to be important, but it\u2019s even more\r\nimportant to be good.\u201d\r\nJoshua, your namesake, is such a naughty little boy. But he\r\nwalks with stature and authority. He came into my life just\r\nwhen I needed him, and every time I see him I see you in him,\r\nand I feel encouraged. Like the girl who visited our office with\r\nher father, I want to make you proud of me.\r\nPeter is in Form Four now. You can\u2019t imagine the magnitude\r\nof pride as I wait for him to \u2018clear\u2019 high school. There was a\r\ntime when this milestone looked like a far off dream \u2013 a mirage,\r\neven. Then, disease, discrimination and death were the order\r\nof my day.\r\nDad, you\u2019re irreplaceable, and I dedicate this Father\u2019s Day to\r\nyou, and to all dads who love their daughters the way you loved\r\nme.\r\nasuntawagura@hotmail.com\r\nDad\u2019s words of wisdom"}
