Workplace transfers a
setback to HIV fight

By NATION Reporter
Frequent transfers of civil servants
fuel the spread of HIV and
Aids because they separate
them from their families, say
researchers.
Now, job recruitment programmes
for thousands of
youth are a setback in the fi ght
against HIV.
New measures to deal with
HIV and Aids high risk age
groups being employed must
be put in place, warned a
government survey through
the Governance, Justice, Law
and Order Sector reform programme.
Lifting embargo
The survey, also carried out
by Amref, whose report was
presented to the Ministry of
Justice and Constitutional Affairs,
says that after the lifting
of the employment embargo
imposed 15 years ago under
the Bretton Woods structural
adjustment programmes, government
institutions had an
infl ux of new recruits aged between
17 and 26 years.
The report blames the high
prevalence of HIV in the civil
service on the government’s
failure to comply with work
place policy on the scourge.
Key among the rules fl outed
by the government against its
workers is frequent transfers
separating spouses and travel
policy by the employees.
Work place policy on HIV
stipulates that partners should
not be separated to minimise
vulnerability to infection.
Those affected most, the
survey found, were men in
job groups A to J, with some
moved more than three times
in as many years.
Police and Prisons departments
top the list of the highest
HIV prevalence rate.
The survey states that the
HIV status of civil servants remains
largely unknown, causing
loss of work days through
related illnesses.
“Stigma remains a signifi -
cant problem in government
institutions and lack of disclosure
of HIV status undermines
success of prevention
programmes,” it explains.
The report calls for new
ways to encourage staff openness,
and severe penalties for
civil servants who discriminate
against HIV-infected colleagues.
It recommends adoption
of an ethical code spelling
out principles of how workers
should deal with each other
and clients.
