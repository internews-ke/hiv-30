Ross Landon and wife Elif Yavuz
Award-winning British architect Ross Langdon and his wife,
Harvard-trained malaria specialist Elif Yavuz, were among those
killed during the Westgate Mall attack.
Mr Langdon and his eight and-a-half months pregnant wife had
gone to the shopping mall that fateful Saturday for lunch when
they were mowed down by the terrorists.
They were found lying in a pool of blood with Mr Langdon holding
protectively onto his heavily pregnant wife with the burger and
chips they had just bought scattered on the floor a few metres
away.
Mr Langdon, who studied architecture at the University of
Tasmania and the University of Sydney, worked for several firms
before founding his own firm Regional Associates Ltd in May 2008.
He was credited for a number of projects across Africa, which
included designing an HIV-Aids hospital in Kenya free of charge.
Ms Yavuz was, on the other hand, a malaria specialist working for
the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation, founded by the
former US president. She was based in Kenya.
Born in Holland, Ms Yavuz had lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
while studying at the renowned Harvard University.
