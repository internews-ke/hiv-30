It kills the bacterium when the\r\nwater is expceed to the sun fora daywhen\r\nIt Is bright, or two days when it is cloudy.\r\n\u2018It requiresa raisea sur6ce and a piece\r\nof shiny matuti to wort says Prof Were.\r\n\u201cIn the runil areas the nick that is used\r\nfor airing utensils may be used. We know\r\npiped water is ideaL but before it becomes\r\navailable for all thiscould worlC\r\nThe method has been proved to work\r\nin parts that Lie between 35 degrees north\r\nand south of the equator, and Africa lies\r\nsmack in the middle of the two latitudes,\r\nShe made her presentation on the\r\nfourth day of the global health confer\r\nence at Kenvatta International Cbnfor\r\nence Centre, Nairobi, last Thursday.\r\nThe conference that closed on Friday\r\nwith the development of the Nairobi Call\r\nfor Action, was attended by health profes\r\nsionals from all pins of the world. This\r\nwas the first time it was being held in M\r\nriot, and Thursday was the \u201cAfrica Day\u201d\r\non which focus was on health promotion\r\nfor the continent.\r\nThe Thurstlay morning session was\r\ndominated by nills for policy makers to\r\nfocus on the \u201cAfrican e,\u2019cperience\u201d to get\r\nsolutions to the myriad problems Lacing\r\nthe continent,\r\nProf Were\u2019s second suestion was the\r\nmaternal and child health handbook,\r\nwhich is the result of studies in Nigeria\r\nthat show that mothers could be bet\r\nter than hospitals in keeping the card\r\ncontaining the record of their children\u2019s\r\nprogre from the prenatal phase to five\r\nyears.\r\nIn Japan. the method has been proved\r\nto work especially where a record of the\r\nmother\u2019s pregnancyand the child\u2019s medi\r\ncal history were placed in one book upto\r\nThe solar water\r\ndisinfection tises the sun\u2019s\r\nultra\u2014violet ras to kill\r\ngenns iii drinking water\r\nage five. It has been practised there for 60\r\nyears. and in some provinces, records are\r\nkept for up to 20 years. The book Is then\r\nhanded over to the brk1emom to prove\r\nthat his bride ishiIthy.\r\nProf Were argued that the adoption of\r\nthe process could help in strengthening\r\nmediotl care and push efforts to attain\r\nMillennium Development Goals four and\r\nGoal four involves reducing child\r\nmortality, while five is intended to 1m-\r\npnwe maternal health.\r\nFrom World Health Organisation\r\nrecords, black Mrioi currently lags be-\r\nkind other regions in attaining the goals\r\nset at the UN Millennium Summit In Sep\r\ntember 2000. Kenya is unlilce\u00ecvto meet\r\nthe MDG targets by 2015 at the current\r\nrates.
