THE KEY THRUST AREAS

Message from
Hon. Dr. Linah
Jebii Kilimo, EGH,
MP, Assistant
Minister for
Co-operative
Development and
Marketing
The ministry and
the co-operative
movement
believe in serious
collaborative
efforts that will
build confidence
and enhance the
savings culture
among members.
Member education
and training will,
among other key
thrusts, focus
on changing
attitudes to
reflect a confident
21st century
co-operative subsector.
Besides low
levels of education
and training,
among the main
social factors that
are likely to affect
the operations of
the ministry are
a high prevalence
of HIV/AIDS. HIV
& AIDS affects
productivity
of staff and
often leads to
loss of skilled
staff members
and diverts
resources meant
for investment
in the sector.
Mainstreaming of
Gender and Youth
issues is important
for effective
leadership of both
the ministry and
the co-operative
movement. Low
levels of education
and training/
capacity building
are likely to affect
the operations
and performance
of both the
Ministry and
the co-operative
movement. The
provision of
housing will affect
the performance
of the co-operative
movement while
that of office
accommodation
will affect
the ministry’s
performance. The
Strategic Plan has
taken all these
factors likely to
jeopardize its
implementation
into consideration
and measures will
be put in place to
address them.
As a government
ministry, we are
determined to
deliver on the
promises of this
Strategic Plan,
and will do so
through teamwork
internally and
with other sector
ministries and
stakeholders.
