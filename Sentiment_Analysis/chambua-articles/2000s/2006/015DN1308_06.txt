Bar workers vow
to fight for rights

By CLAY MUGANDA
Do you know which Kenyan
lager is 100 per
cent rewarding? Or
which vodka is premium
and original? Or the cream
that is served chilled . . . and
enjoyed with ice and friends? If
you don’t have the answers, then
your time is not 17.59, Our Time
or Guinness Time, and neither
are you a responsible adult who
drinks responsibly.
If you had attended the First
National Bar Hostess Conference
on HIV and Aids in Kenya at
City Hall on Thursday and Friday,
you could haveknown.
The answers to those questions
were on banners in the conference
hall — courtesy of East
Africa Breweries Limited.
And since one good turn
deserves another, EABL laid out
a cocktail that left the ladies
yearning for more. At least there
are people who realise their
importance in the industry.
“The cocktail should have been
today,” Sophia remarked on Friday,
the last day of the conference.
“Many of us are aware of
HIV/Aids. Unless our employers
are brought in these discussions,
our rights will just be a mirage.”
Her sentiments were echoed by
others at Charter Hall, where bar
hostesses drawn from Uganda,
Tanzania and Kenya gathered to
talk about their rights, working
conditions, and HIV/Aids.
“We are not empowered and
we cannot stand against our
employers by demanding more
than what we are given, or complaining
about the working conditions,”
said Gladys, 24, who works
in a pub in the city centre.
“You do that, and you lose
your job. You cannot feed yourself
and your child on rights.”
Many of the bar hostesses say
that they are ready to form a
union but there is a problem.
“Legislation should be passed
compelling bar owners to realise
the important role we play in the
society,” Sophia said after Justice
Minister Martha Karua had
advised them to form a union.
“Unless the bar owners are
brought on board, we will be
fighting a losing battle.”
While opening the conference
on Thursday, Nominated MP
Njoki Ndungu said bar workers
have a right to say no to sexual
advances from clients. “Just
because you are a bar professional
does not make you commercial
sex worker,” she said. “It is about
consent, not career.” Ms Ndungu
