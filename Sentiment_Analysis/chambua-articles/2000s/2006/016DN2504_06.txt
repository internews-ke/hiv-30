Hopes for
new gel
in war
on Aids

CAPE TOWN, Monday
Researchers are closing in on a breakthrough
microbicide gel to help prevent
HIV infection in women, scientists said
on Monday, but a lack of funding by
major pharmaceutical companies is hampering
research.
“I think for many years the microbicides
research field was a little bit tentative
about making too much noise about
the potential of this technology,” Ms
Helen Rees, executive director of South
Africa’s Reproductive Health and HIV
Research Unit, said on the sidelines of
an international conference in Cape
Town.
“At this point the microbicides
research field is feeling that there might
well be the possibility of having an effective
microbicide in the next few years,”
she told Reuters.
Microbicides cover a range of vaginal
and rectal creams, gels or suppositories
that kill microbes and aim to cut the
transmission of HIV and possibly other
sexually transmitted diseases when
applied before sex.
If proven successful, they could provide
a powerful prevention tool for Aids
and one that, unlike condoms, can be
directly controlled by women. Five
potential microbicide products are in
advanced clinical trials and scientists say
the first results should be made public
within two years.
Ms Rees, a co-chair of the Cape Town
conference, said the trials and other new
products, many of them being tested in
South Africa — the country hardest hit
by Aids —offered exciting prospects for
a scientific breakthrough. “There are a
lot of new products coming through the
pipeline, new molecules and exciting
new potential products that look, in the
laboratory and in animal models, as if
they will probably be even more effective
against HIV,” she said. “What we
will see as the months and years go by
are some of these products being formulated
and moving rapidly into the clinical
trial phases.” (Reuters)
