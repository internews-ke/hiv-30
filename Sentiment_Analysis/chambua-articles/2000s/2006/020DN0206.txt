Annan tells leaders to help
prostitutes battle Aids

UNITED NATIONS, Thursday
UN Secretary-General Kofi
Annan challenged world leaders
yesterday to protect the
most marginal groups in society from
Aids — prostitutes, drug users and
homosexuals.
Mr Annan and General Assembly
President Jan Eliasson opened a
three-day conference on Aids that
includes thousands of activists, ministers
and diplomats to assess progress
so far.
To combat Aids, “It means we must
work closely and constructively with
those who have too often been marginalised
— sex workers, injecting
drug users and men who have sex
with men,” Annan said.
“We need to be realistic,” Mr Annan
said. “If we are here to try and end
the epidemic
and fight the
epidemic, we
will not succeed
by
putting our
heads in the
sand and pretending
these
people do not
exist or do not need help.”
According to a major UNAids report
released on Tuesday, the spread of
the pandemic had slowed but drug
treatment is only available to less than
half of those infected with HIV, the
virus that causes Aids.
Still, many delegations, particularly
Islamic ones and some conservative
Latin American nations, refuse to
mention prostitutes, drug users and
homosexuals, in a final statement now
under negotiation.
They prefer citing “vulnerable”
groups, fearing that specific mention
would endorse these groups. Also in
dispute are rights for girls and sex
education, among other issues.
The United States took the same position
at the last major UN Aids conference
in 2001 but US officials said this
no longer was the case.
“We would love the mention of vulnerable
populations -- generally, specifically,”
said Assistant Secretary of State
Kirsten Silverberg, who heads the State
Department office responsible for UN
affairs.
But an early marked-up draft showed
US objections to a European proposal
on services for homosexuals, sex workers
and drug users. The United States
rejected the paragraph mainly because it
called for “harm reduction,” a euphemism
for needle exchanges, which
Washington opposes.
Mr Annan also stressed the increase of
women contracting the disease, especially
in sub-Sahara Africa. Of the more
than 38 million people infected worldwide,
17 million are women, threequarters
of them in Africa, said the UN
report. Particularly disadvantaged are
women who have been raped, including
child brides by their husbands and
women who are never diagnosed and
treated.
“I believe that we are having such a big
epidemic, among other reasons, because
of the lack of control of women over
sexuality,” Dr Peter Piot, the executive
director of UNAids, the leading group
campaigning against the pandemic.
The three-day meeting is timed to the
25th anniversary of the first documented
Aids cases on June 5, 1981. It is aimed at
setting guidelines for universal treatment
and prevention.
Dr Piot said he hoped the meeting will
generate long-term funding for
HIV/Aids, which needs some $20 billion
annually by 2010. Spending in
2005 met its target of $8 billion.
The United States is by far the largest
donor, with President George W.
Bush having pledged $15 billion over
five years. But Dr Mark Dybul, acting
US global Aids coordinator, said
Washington did not believe in “largescale
international targets” because
each country had to set its own.
However, the final declaration is at an
impasse, said Ms Adrienne Germain,
president of the International Women’s
Health Coalition, who has been
following Aids debates for two decades.
Even some diplomats from Africa are
going back on agreements their leaders
had reached in early May, she said.
“There is no leadership as far as I can
see ... on many issues.”
According to the report released on
Tuesday, a worldwide survey has
found that nearly 40 million people
worldwide are living with HIV/Aids.
India now has the largest number of
Aids infections, but the epidemic still
remains at its worst in sub-Saharan
Africa, where per capita rates continue
to climb in several countries.
The virus “has spread further, faster
and with more catastrophic long-term
effects than any other disease,’’ Mr
Annan said. “Its impact has become a
devastating obstacle to the progress of
humankind.’’
But, civil society groups said they
feared that there was not a real sense
of urgency among diplomats at the
meeting to put forward specific proposals
or shed outdated ideas about
the virus.
“Even though Aids should be everybody’s
problem and issue, and everyone
should care about it, I’m sorry
to say that for the most part the diplomats
in this building either don’t care
or don’t know,’’ said Ms Germain.
Most of the targets from 2001 have
not been met. Among the biggest failures
was the so-called “3 by 5'’ target
— of getting treatment to three million
poor people infected with Aids by
the end of 2005. (Agencies)
