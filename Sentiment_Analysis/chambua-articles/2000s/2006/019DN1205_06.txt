Medics’ trial
over Aids
adjourned

TRIPOLI, Thursday
Libya today abruptly adjourned the
retrial of five Bulgarian nurses and a
Palestinian doctor accused of deliberately
infecting hundreds of children at a
Libyan hospital with the virus that
causes Aids.
“The retrial case was postponed and
will resume on June 13, with the defendants
remaining in detention,” judge
Mahmoud Chaouissa said, denying a
defence request that their clients be
released on bail.
The judge said the postponment was
needed to allow lawyers who lacked
proper papers to bring the documents to
court.
None of those involved in the long
proceedings seemed discouraged by the
delay.
“It is a good start and the postponement
underlined the court’s eagerness to
better check the facts and the evidence
of the case,” said Mr Othman Bizanti,
the medics’ lead lawyer.
Mr Idriss Lagha, a spokesman for the
families of the infected children, called
the postponement “a normal court decision”.
Bulgaria’s Foreign Minister Ivailo
Kalfin told Bulgarian national radio:
“We hope the trial will begin and end as
quickly as possible. ... The sooner it
ends, the better.” The medics first stood
trial in 2004 on charges they infected 426
Libyan children with the HIV virus
when they worked in a Benghazi hospital.
Around 50 of the children have died
and the case has fuelled outrage among
the families of the victims. The six
defendants, who have been in jail since
1999, were sentenced to death in May
2004. (Reuters)
