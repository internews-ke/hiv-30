Official: Discipline keeps Aids at bay at NYS

By NATION Correspondent
National Youth Service members
have largely been spared the
Aids pandemic because of discipline
within its ranks, the organisation
has said.
NYS director Japhet Mwania said
strict discipline was the only protection
against HIV infection.
He said a random survey conducted in
2004 at NYS Training School in Gilgil
indicated that out of the 3,500 servicemen
and women who went for voluntary
HIV test, less than one per cent were
positive.
“This has encouraged us to ensure that
there is sustained discipline in order to
save the lives of these active young people,”
he said.
Mr Mwania was speaking at NYS Technical
School in Mtongwe during the
opening of a VCT centre funded by the
Centers for Disease Control.
He said that due to the relatively young
age of the recruits, he had been a worried
man, but asked them to maintain
high standards of self discipline “in
order to survive in the wake of the worst
threat to human survival”.
Ms Mercy Muthui, the technical adviser
of CDC, said the VCT centre would be
open not only to the NYS servicemen
and women, but also to the larger
Mtongwe community. She encouraged
married people to visit as couples.
