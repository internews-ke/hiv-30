{"text": "Sunday Nation/June 18, 2006\r\nProject brings hope to slum dwellers\r\n\r\nKibaba Kidogo is changing the long-held view of faith-based organisations as centres of charity\r\n\r\nIt began as an effort to help people living with\r\nHIV and Aids, but has slowly becoming a\r\nmodel to residents of Nairobi's slums on the\r\nbenefits of pooling funds to start small businesses.\r\nWhen Zinduka Afrika, linked to the\r\nInternational Christian Centre in Nairobi,\r\nlaunched the Kibaba Kidogo project as an offshoot\r\nof its regular HIV/Aids programme, Zinduka's\r\ndirector Trizzer Mungai was leaning more on her\r\nfaith than hard-boiled economic theories.\r\nAt the core of the micro-enterprise project,\r\nwhich seeks to give HIV-infected people \ufffd especially\r\nyouth and women \ufffd a better quality of life,\r\nis changing the view of faith-based non-governmental\r\norganisations (NGOs) as channels for\r\nhandouts.\r\nAs a church-based NGO, Zinduka found it even\r\nmore difficult to explain why it would not give out\r\nhandouts \ufffd you know\ufffdJohn 3:16 and all. But\r\nMrs Mungai was determined to go a different\r\nroute, somewhere between a traditional NGO and\r\na church group.\r\nAnd so Kibaba Kidogo was born \ufffd culled from\r\nthe Kiswahili saying, kidogo kidogo hujaza kibaba.\r\nThe concept is quite simple. Get six or seven\r\nslum residents together to pool the little money\r\nthey have: it could be as low as Sh40 since they\r\nhave no regular income.\r\nTo avoid stigmatizing those infected with the\r\nHIV virus, the project has been opened up to anyone\r\none willing to join. \ufffd\ufffdIf you give a poor person\r\nSh500 to start a business, and yet they cannot even\r\neat, that money is wasted. For them their basic\r\nneeds, and not business, are a priority. We work to\r\nkeep the little they have in the community,\ufffd\ufffd said\r\nMrs Mungai. Kibaba Kidogo is unique in the\r\nsense that no donor or church funds were used to\r\nstart it, but it relies entirely on the meagre\r\nresources of the members, currently divided into\r\n20 groups. It wasn\ufffdt easy starting off. \ufffd\ufffdWe told\r\nthem we were bringing knowledge, not money.\r\nThey would listen, shake their heads and go\r\naway. Their friendship and relationship with\r\nthe church and themselves is all the security\r\nrequired. \ufffd\ufffdWe then move from social networks\r\nto social capital,\ufffd\ufffd says Mrs Mungai.\r\nWhere people have defaulted, the networks\r\nkicked and forced them to pay up \ufffd plus the\r\nfact that their money was in the group.\r\nIn the slightly over one year that the project\r\nhas been on, its fund value has grown to over\r\nSh500,000. Because only two officers are needed,\r\nZinduka Afrika has been able to keep costs\r\nfor the project low. The officers offer guidance\r\nand skills training. Members borrowing share\r\ntheir business ideas to avoid duplication.\r\n\ufffd\ufffdAs months go by, we withdraw slowly to let\r\nthem own the groups. After four months we\r\nleave the management to them, and only intervene\r\non their request. We want that after liquidation,\r\nthey are able to survive without us,\ufffd\ufffd\r\nsaid Mrs Mungai.\r\nTo start off, six members of a group may\r\nsave just Sh100 each every month. Because the\r\nseed money is low, it is first loaned to one\r\nmember at 10 per cent interest.\r\nMeanwhile, contributions continue and by\r\nthe fourth or fifth month, there is enough\r\nmoney on the table to lend to all group members.\r\nWithin three months if there is no one borrowing,\r\nthen an agreed portion of the funds are\r\nliquidated, and the process begins again.\r\n\ufffd\ufffdNobody misses the meetings. You should\r\nsee the excitement on their faces. This really\r\nempowers them,\ufffd\ufffd said Mrs Mungai.\r\nMrs Lucy Syombua who lives in Nairobi's\r\nMukuru Nyayo slums, is one of the beneficiaries.\r\n\"After I was introduced to the Zinduka\r\nAfrika savings and loan programme, I\r\nmobilised 11 women to form a savings and\r\nloan group. We were trained by Zinduka\r\nAfrika, and my initial loan was Sh500 which I\r\nused to start up a small business of selling milk\r\nnear my house.\"\r\nTo start with, she bought five litres of milk\r\ndaily and sold it to her neighbours. Within three\r\nmonths, her business had expanded and now\r\nsells up to 15 litres of milk daily.\r\n\"The programme has transformed my life.\r\nI'm no longer the housewife waiting for her\r\nhusband to provide everything. I own my business\r\nand buy food and other things for my family,\"\r\nsaid Mrs Syombua.\r\nOver 500 people have received training in\r\nentrepreneurship and savings and loan in the\r\nlast four months. One group earned over\r\nSh40,000 by selling items they had made.\r\nBefore Zinduka Africa implemented Kibaba\r\nKidogo, Mrs Mungai had tried out something\r\nsimilar with eight of her friends.\r\n\ufffd\ufffdI remember it was very hard, because if you\r\nare used to the \ufffdmerry go round\ufffd thing, you feel\r\nyou need so much money for you to do something\r\nsubstantial. I guess it was made harder by\r\nthe fact that we had a regular income.\r\nEventually we agreed on Sh2000.\ufffd\ufffd\r\nThey have liquidated the group twice now\r\nand have Sh300,000 in funds. They have their\r\nown rules\"\r\n\"Last December when we liquidated yet\r\nagain, each of us got Sh30,000. It is a great idea\r\nfor the low and middle income groups. You\r\nrealise that you don\ufffdt need to go and beg\r\nbanks,\" said Mrs Mungai.\r\nZinduka Afrika (ZAF) is registered in Kenya\r\nas an international non-governmental organisation.\r\nIts vision is to reflect the compassionate\r\nnature of God to the poor and needy through\r\nsocial and developmental services."}
