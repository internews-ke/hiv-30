Vatican yet
to decide on
new condom
directive

VATICAN CITY, Wednesday
The Vatican is studying whether condoms
can be condoned to help stem the
tide of Aids and a host of other bioethical
issues such as stem cell research, but
there is no indication of when or whether
it would pronounce itself on the matter,
officials said.
Cardinal Javier Lozano Barragan, who
heads the Vatican office for health care,
was quoted over the weekend in Italy’s
La Repubblica daily as saying his office
was preparing a document on the question
of condoms and Aids, and that it
would be released soon.
But yesterday, he clarified that his
office was merely studying the issue at
the request of the Pope as part of a
broader “dialogue” with other Vatican
departments.
“We are conducting a very profound
scientific, technical and moral study” on
how to deal with married couples when
one is infected with HIV, he told Vatican
Radio.
He said the study would be presented
to Pope Benedict XVI, “who with his
wisdom and the help of the Holy Spirit
will take a decision and tell us where we
are going.” While the Vatican has no
specific policy concerning condoms and
Aids, the Catholic Church opposes the
use of condoms as part of its overall
teaching against contraception. It advocates
sexual abstinence as the best way to
combat the spread of HIV, the virus that
causes Aids.
The issue was reignited last week when
a one-time papal contender, retired
Milan Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini, said
that condoms were the “lesser evil in
combating the spread of Aids. (AP)
