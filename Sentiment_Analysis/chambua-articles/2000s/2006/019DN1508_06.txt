Long distance
drivers raving
over job terms

By PETER NGARE
The job is lonely, and the
harsh working conditions
drive them mad — and into
cheap sex.
Take Joe for example, the
seasoned long-distance truck driver with
more than 10 years of experience. The
39-year-old driver is a bitter man. He
attributes the break up of his family five
years ago to “unfriendly working
conditions”.
He also confesses that he is living with
HIV, which he says he could not have
contracted, were it not for the kind of
work he does.
Joe’s story is replicated over and over
by other drivers. Theirs are stories of
Kenyans caught between a rock and a
hard place. They spend their lives on
highways with plenty of cheap sex, meagre
pay, and lack of job security.
The International
Transport Federation
last year classified Kenyan
truck drivers as the
most abused in the
world, due to the harsh
working conditions and
poor pay.
Mr Nicholas Mbugua,
the chairman of the
Long Distance Truck
Drivers Welfare Association,
laments the poor
state of affairs bedevilling
the drivers.
One thing the drivers
have to put up with is
driving long distances
without breaks.
Six-day journey According to Mr Abdi Mohammed
who plies between Mombasa
and Kampala, a journey to
and from coastal town takes about six
days.
“After setting off from Mombasa in
the morning, I drive for 10 hours to
Mlolongo weighbridge, where I put up
overnight,” says Mohammed.
According to Alfred, some drivers
have to spend the night in the driver’s
cabin. “I’m paid Sh3,500 as safari
allowance. The money is not enough for
food and lodging. So I sleep in the cabin,”
says Alfred.
Mr Mohammed says that after Mlolongo,
the journey to Malaba border
point kicks off early the following morning.
He arrives there in the evening,
then spends the night awaiting the final
stretch to Kampala.
At Kampala, the drivers can spend a
day or two as the cargo is off-loaded and
then start the return journey to
Mombasa.
Arrive in Mombasa Mr Mohammed says that on arriving
in Mombasa, most drivers
are not given a chance to see
their families, and are instead ordered
to drive to the go-downs for loading. “I
just take a nap on the cabin and wait to
start the journey to Kampala again,” he
says.
“If you report
that the lorry has
mechanical problems,
you are told
to load first and
then drive to Mariakani,
where
mechanics look
into it. This denies
t h e d r i v e r a
chance to go
home for a rest
and to be with the
f a m i l y , ” s a y s
Mohammed.
According to
Mr Mbugua, most
transport companies
pay their
drivers between
S h 3 , 0 0 0 a n d
Sh4,000 as safari allowance. This, he
says, is far below the recommended
Sh20,000 for a journey from Mombasa
to Kampala.
He said some drivers are forced to sit
behind the steering wheel for more than
20 hours at a time. This is usually out of
the need to be at a particular point on
time to escape sacking and abusive
language.
According to Transport Licensing
Board chairman Hassan ole Kamwaro,
what is happening is in contravention of
law. Mr Kamwaro says all drivers are
supposed to rest after every eight hours
on the road. But he says this is being
flouted by employers.
Worse still for the drivers, companies
are now laying off loaders, who are
important companions to drivers. Mr
Mbugua said a number of companies
had adopted a policy where drivers
make the long distance alone.
“If you have a tyre burst, it is a nightmare
changing it. We are being exposed
to attacks by robbers on the way,” said
one driver.
The drivers have also to contend with
the fact that they have no job security.
Mr Mbugua said on employment, the
drivers do not enter into any written
agreement with the employer.
Mr Kamwaro terms this illegal, for all
drivers of commercial vehicles are supposed
to be employed on permanent
basis.
Mr Mbugua said the salaries of most
drivers ranged between Sh8,000 and
Sh12,000. He said this compared poorly
with drivers working for companies in
Uganda. “Drivers for Ugandan lorries
get an equivalent of Sh30,000,” he said.
Most drivers interviewed disclosed
that they were forced to drive overloaded
lorries. They said the lorries are
interfered with to make room for more
cargo. “It’s a daunting task to control an
overloaded lorry. If you complain or
refuse to start the journey, you are
sacked,” said one driver.
An overloaded lorry stands high
chances of experiencing tyre bursts.
“The truck owners overload the lorries
and in case you have a tyre burst or are
involved in accident, your salary is
deducted,” said Mr Mbugua.
When working as a long distance driver,
you never know whether you will be
in employment the next minute. “Drivers
are sacked through mobile phones.
The employer just calls to ask where you
are, and he tells you to park on the side
of the road and hand over to another
driver,” said Mr Mohammed.
According to Mr Mbugua the harsh
working conditions facing the drivers
have put them in the category of high
risk groups when it comes to Aids. Failure
to give the drivers a break after the
trip to be with their families exposes
them to the lure of sex along the way.
Prostitutes position Prostitutes usually position themselves
at strategic points, with
their favourite spots being Mariakani,
Mlolongo, Machakos Junction,
Salgaa and Malaba. Drivers said the
conditions they are exposed to has led to
the break-up of a number of families.
They blame the Government for failing
to register a trade union that would
champion their rights.
“Since 1996, we have been agitating
for a union, but the Government is yet
to register it,” said Mr Mbugua.
He claimed that the registration of the
union was being frustrated by lorry owners
who, he said, had compromised senior
government officials.
