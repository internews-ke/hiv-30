{"text": "Daily Nation/ Wednesday, June 14, 2006\r\nBoost war on graft, urges Bellamy\r\n\r\nBy NATION Reporter\r\nThe US ambassador yesterday said the\r\nfight against corruption should start\r\nfrom the top \ufffd just like the fight against\r\nAids.\r\nPresident Kibaki initiated a campaign\r\nagainst Aids by taking part in an advertisement\r\nhighlighting the need to combat\r\nthe disease.\r\nThe outgoing American ambassador,\r\nMr William Bellamy, also said Kenya\r\ncould have realised a higher economic\r\ngrowth if corruption had been eradicated,\r\nelectricity and fuel prices reduced\r\nand the road network improved.\r\nHe also said the US would be watching\r\nhow Kenya conducted its war on\r\ncorruption.\r\nBut he denied claims that the US was\r\nforcing Kenya to enact a \ufffdforeign\ufffd antiterrorism\r\nlaw.\r\n\ufffdWhatever legislation Kenya produces\r\nis Kenya\ufffds. It is never going to be\r\nan American law,\ufffd he said.\r\nThe envoy spoke when he met Vice-\r\nPresident Moody Awori at his Jogoo\r\nHouse office in Nairobi.\r\nMr Awori said Kenya had put structures\r\nin place to fight the vice and the\r\nresults were evident. He said\r\ncorruption was not a Kenyan\r\nproblem but also developed\r\ncountries\ufffd.\r\nThe VP said resources were\r\nrequired to strengthen institutions\r\nthat investigate and prosecute\r\ncorruption suspects, such\r\nas the attorney-general\ufffds office\r\nand the Kenya Anti-\r\nCorruption Commission.\r\nThe two said the campaign\r\nagainst Aids had been successful\r\nbecause the number of daily deaths had\r\nreduced from 700 to 200 due to advocacy\r\nand sensitisation programmes.\r\nMr Bellamy said his government\r\nwould continue assisting the Aids\r\ncampaign.\r\nThe Vice-President said politicians\r\nwould be encouraged to demonstrate\r\npolitical will by either checking their\r\nHIV status in public or visiting voluntary\r\ncounselling and testing centres.\r\nMr Bellamy said he was critical of the\r\nGovernment because he wanted to protect\r\nAmerican interests.\r\n\ufffdAs an ambassador, it is my responsibility\r\nas a representative of the US to\r\nfollow the politics of Kenya... It is\r\nnormal for ambassadors to\r\nspeak on issues,\ufffd he said.\r\n\ufffdIf it affects American\r\ninterests I speak, that is my\r\nrole... I learnt a phrase from\r\nPresident Kibaki that you do\r\nnot need your enemies to tell\r\nyou something is wrong, you\r\nneed your friends.\ufffd\r\nHowever, he said Kenya\r\nneeded a law to deal with the\r\nthreats of terrorism as the\r\ncountry had been targeted\r\nbecause it was a success story.\r\nAccording to him, the US and other governments\r\nwere working to help Kenya to\r\nprotect itself.\r\nMr Awori said Kenya was a victim of\r\nterrorism because of her friends like the\r\nUS which were also targeted.\r\n\ufffdThe attacks were meant to send a\r\nmessage to America,\ufffd he said.\r\nHe said Kenyans could only accept\r\nhomegrown laws.\r\nThe VP said the country\ufffds economic\r\ngrowth would have been higher than 5.8\r\nper cent were it not for the drought\r\nwhich affected agricultural production\r\nand criticised those claiming that the\r\neffects of the growth had not trickled\r\ndown to the poor."}
