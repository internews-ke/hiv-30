HIV/AIDS Programme
31st October 2006 All Saints Cathedral
The Bible Society of Kenya has initiated a HIV/AIDS project called “Where is the Good Samaritan
Today?” This project aims at contributing to the reduction of the spread and prevalence of HIV &
AIDS through behaviour change. The Bible Society of Kenya will hold workshops to train church
workers and teachers in primary and secondary schools on use of Scripture-based literature and
video package on HIV/AIDS. The programme will also address other related issues such as
provision of love and care for the afflicted, besides encouraging positive living.
Expected Outcomes on the target audience;
.They will have adequate knowledge and skills to make right decisions on how to live responsibly.
. The church and schools will “break the silence” and openly discuss the HIV/AIDS issues and
give appropriate guidance to those at risk.
. The churches will address the wrong attitude that has promoted stigma and discrimination to
those infected with, and directly affected by the HIV/AIDS.
. More people will be open to go for the HIV tests in order to know their status.
. Christians will offer care and love to those that are afflicted and affected by HIV/AIDS.
