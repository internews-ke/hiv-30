Pope
may lift
condom
ban

NEW YORK,
Wednesday
Pope Benedict XVI,
known for his conservative
views on issues
ranging from homosexuality
to abortion, may review a ban
on contraception after a study
on the spread of infectious
diseases, including Aids.
The 200-page report, commissioned
by the Pope in April, is
now complete, Mexico’s Cardinal
Javier Lozano Barragan,
head of the Pontifical Council
for Health, told reporters late
yesterday. Excerpts of Cardinal
Barragan’s comments
were released on the Vatican
Web site.
“Following the Pope’s
instructions, we accurately
studied the contraceptive
from both a scientific and
moral point of view and
handed in our study,’’ Cardinal
Barragan said. “Let’s
hope that the Holy Father
says what is most convenient
on this subject.’’
Under the 26-year papacy of
John Paul II, the Vatican’s opposition
to birth control did not
waver. The church’s ban on contraception,
even the use of condoms
to stop the spread of Aids,
has drawn criticism from aid
workers and some church officials,
such as Cardinal Carlo
Maria Martini. Any easing of the
ban would contradict the Humanae
Vitae, the 1968 encyclical
in which Pope Paul VI chose to
overrule a papal commission that
recommended some form of
relaxation of church rules on
birth control.
In a June 2005 speech to African
bishops, the newly elected Pope
Benedict stuck to the official Vatican
line, blaming contraception for
a “breakdown of sexual morality’’
and repeating that abstinence and
fidelity in marriage were the only
safe way to prevent the spread of
the HIV virus. (Agencies)
