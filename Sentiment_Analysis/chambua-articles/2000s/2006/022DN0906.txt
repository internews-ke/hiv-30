Proposed
law on Aids
passes the
first test
People who knowingly infect others with
the Aids virus will be jailed for at least
seven years, if a proposed law law is
passed by Parliament.
One convicted of the offence would
also be liable to a fine of up to
Sh500,000, according the HIV and Aids
Prevention and Control Bill, tabled for
debate by Health minister Charity Ngilu.
The Bill provides a legal framework
for prevention, management and control
of the disease.
It bars forced HIV tests for purposes
of employment, marriage, admission to
educational institutions or entry into the
country.
B u t a p e r s o n
charged with a sexual
offence can be compelled
to undergo tests.
The Bill seeks to
remove confirmation
of one’s HIV status as
a condition for getting
insurance cover or
loans.
Contained in the Bill are also tough
sanctions against those undertaking
research on HIV and Aids-related diseases
without the knowledge and consent
of the person on whom the study is
conducted.
The Bill also seeks to rein in contraband
clinics that have been offering HIV
tests and passes over the role only those
certified by the Ministry of Health.
But some MPs yesterday proposed
that the clause be deleted to allow for
the use of personal kits for testing.
Parliament ended debate on the Bill
yesterday, sailing through the Second
Reading.
