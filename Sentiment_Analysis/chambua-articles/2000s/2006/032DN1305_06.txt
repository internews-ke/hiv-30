Aids jelly trials start in Kenya
New cream for women aimed at minimising chances of HIV infection

A new anti-Aids jelly aimed at minimising
chances of HIV infection is already
under trial in Kenya.
The tests have started in Thika, Mombasa,
Nandi Hills and Nairobi.
According to Kenya Medical
Research Institute director Davy Koech,
the areas were chosen for their wide difference
in HIV prevalence rates.
“Some of the regions have high HIV
prevalence, while others have low prevalence.
This will enable us to come up
with better results,” said Dr
Koech.
The gel is applied in a
woman’s genitals to protect
her against HIV and other
sexually transmitted
viruses.
While confirming the
exercise, Health minister
Charity Ngilu said the gel
would enable women to
take control of themselves.
“At the moment, condoms
are controlled by
men, and that is why we welcome the
trials,” said Mrs Ngilu after opening a
health meeting at a city hotel.
The trials are conducted by Kemri in
collaboration with the International
Partnership for Microbicides (IPM).
A team of scientists from the two
organisations have visited Mombasa to
inspect the trial sites.
Individuals will be divided into two
groups, with one given the gel and the
other a placebo (sham therapy).
The two groups which will also
include people of high risk behaviour,
will then be studied over several years.
However, Dr Koech declined to state
the number of individuals involved in
the study, saying it was early.
“We will announce the figures of people
involved in the study later,” he said.
According to the researchers, it will
take five to seven years before the efficacy
of the gel is ascertained.
Large scale experiments on the same
gel are being conducted in South Africa,
Rwanda and Tanzania.
To come up with an effective medicine,
IPM chief executive officer Zeda
Rosenberg said thousands of women
had to be involved in the trials. But she
warned that the gel had risks of failure,
just like any other contraceptive.
“This is not a magic tool in the
prevention of HIV. That’s why
research on vaccines must continue,”
Ms Rosenberg said.
She said those being recruited
for the exercise must be informed
of the risks involved, and their
consent sought in advance.
It is believed that the availability
of effective microbicides — in
form of gels, foams and creams —
would greatly empower women
to protect themselves and their
partners.
Some microbicides provide a
physical barrier to keep HIV and other
pathogens from reaching the target cells.
Others enhance the natural defences of
the reproductive organ by maintaining
an acidic pH and stripping the cover of
the disease causing pathogens.
Mrs Ngilu said Kenya had achieved a
lot in the anti-Aids campaign, adding
that prevalence rates had declined from
14 per cent in 1999 to 6.1.
But UN special envoy for HIV/Aids
Stephen Lewis, said African countries
had done little. “It’s been difficult to
change behaviour, especially that of
males,” he said.
