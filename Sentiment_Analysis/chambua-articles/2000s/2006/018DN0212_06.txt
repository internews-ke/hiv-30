Firms ‘best placed
to give Aids drugs’
Access to ARVs
at work must go
up, says the UN

GENEVA, Friday
The workplace may be
the best setting for
millions of people
with HIV and Aids to
be administered drugs
that could extend their lives,
the International Labour
Organisation (ILO) said today.
In a report published on
World Aids Day, the United
Nations agency said that more
than 24 million people in the
global workforce in 2005 suffered
from HIV or the disease
it causes, Aids.
Nearly 67 per cent of these
lived in Africa.
Giving these workers access
to anti-retroviral drug therapy,
or ARVs, could have lengthened
their working lives by
more than two years, and considerably
increased per capita
incomes in places such as sub-
Saharan Africa, the report
found.
“Access to ARVs in the workplace
must rise substantially,”
it said, estimating that 1.8 million
more African workers
would be alive in 2010 if 80 per
cent of the workforce were to
start and stay on ARV therapy
from this year.
Public health experts say
that the life-extending drugs
have transformed the oncedeadly
HIV and Aids into
chronic conditions. But they
need to be taken at regular
intervals to be effective, and
can cause drug resistance when
taken improperly.
The ILO estimated that the
HIV epidemic stripped an average
of 0.5 percentage points off
the economic growth of 43
affected countries every year
between 1992 and 2004.
In sub-Saharan Africa, 31
countries lost 0.7 percentage
points of economic growth per
year during the period.
Employment growth also
suffered markedly. The ILO
said HIV and Aids caused a 0.5
per cent yearly decline in sub-
Saharan Africa’s annual
employment growth rate,
“equivalent to an employment
loss of 1.1 million (jobs) per
year for Africa.”
In China, Premier Wen Jiabao
invited 15 HIV/Aids
orphans and child victims to
tour the ruling Communist Party’s
headquarters today as a top
UN official said the country
needed more education to combat
the disease’s stigma.
Beijing was initially slow to
acknowledge the threat, but it
has stepped up the fight
against HIV/Aids in recent
years, increasing spending on
prevention programmes and
i m p l e m e n t i n g a n t i -
discrimination legislation.
However, UN China Resident
Coordinator Khalid Malik said
there was “great unevenness”
in the supply of healthcare and
tools in China in the fight
against Aids at regional level.
