Libya court to deliver
HIV case verdict
Five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian
doctor could face the firing
squad if a Libyan court convicts
them on Tuesday on charges of
deliberately infecting hundreds of
Libyan children with the virus that
causes Aids. The court will make a
decision that is likely to have repercussions
on the north African country’s
gradual rapprochement with
the West. The six are accused of
intentionally infecting 426 Libyan
children with HIV at a hospital in
Benghazi in the late 1990s.
