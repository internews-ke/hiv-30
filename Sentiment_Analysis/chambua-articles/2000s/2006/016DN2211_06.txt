HIV infection on
the rise, says UN
GENEVA: HIV infection is rising in
every region of the world and
most worryingly in countries like
Uganda and Thailand, which had
been heralded as success stories
in the fight against Aids, the
United Nations said yesterday.
Nearly 40 million adults and children
are infected worldwide. The
most striking increases in new
cases are in east Asia and in eastern
Europe/central Asia, mainly
due to drug use and unsafe sex,
UNAids and the World Health
Organisation said.
