Medic wants Aids
tests for Muslims
before marriage

By NATION Correspondent
Muslim leaders should use mosques to
educate couples on the need to visit
Aids testing centres before marriage, a
doctor has said.
Dr Boa Abdulsamad, who runs a voluntary
counselling and testing (VCT)
centre in Malindi said yesterday that
HIV and Aids were prevalent among
Muslims because their leaders were not
doing enough to curb the spread.
Speaking after receiving equipment
donated by the Council of Imams and
Preachers of Kenya at the Nakumatt
branch at Likoni, Mombasa, the Al
Khairat medical centre boss said Muslims
should be forced to know their HIV
status before marriage.
“The Council of Imams and other religious
organisations have to make it mandatory
for spouses to go for voluntary
counselling and testing as the only way
to arrest the Aids spread, which is rising
at an alarming rate,” he said.
Dr Abdulsamad said there was a lot of
secrecy among Muslims on HIV, as they
associate it with immorality.
“There can never be success in fighting
the pandemic if religious leaders do
not educate their flocks that knowing
one’s status is necessary,” he said.
