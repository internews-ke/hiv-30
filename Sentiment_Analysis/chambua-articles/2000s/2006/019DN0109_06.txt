India on the
spot over
Aids drugs

NEW DELHI, Thursday
India’s top court today asked the government
to explain why it had failed to
meet its target of providing free drugs
for 100,000 HIV-positive people by
2005.
The court also wanted to know on
what basis the government delayed the
objective by two years.
“What’s the difficulty? Why was the
target year shifted?” the three-member
bench, headed by the Chief Justice of
India Y.K. Sabharwal, asked the federal
government.
India is home to 5.7 million people living
with the Aidscausing
HIV, more
than any other
country in the
world, according to
UN estimates.
Several Indian
HIV/Aids NGOs
complained to the
court that not only was India’s target
inadequate, but it was not even being
met.
At their request, the court has asked
the government to explain by end-
September why the 100,000 target had
been postponed twice, most recently to
2007, and how it decided on the original
100,000 target.
Only about 50,000 HIV-positive Indians
are currently believed to be receiving
life-saving anti-retroviral (ARV)
drugs free of charge.
India’s National Aids Control Organisation
says a major obstacle in giving
free drugs is that many patients live in
far-flung rural areas. (Reuters)
