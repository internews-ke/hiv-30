Families flee as cattle
raiders attack village

By JACKLINE MORAA
Raiders stole 350 cattle when they
invaded a village in Trans Mara District
this week.
Tension was high at Olesentu yesterday
after the Easter holiday raid.
Two councillors and their families
were among hundreds of people who
fled the area due to insecurity.
Councillors Tunai ole Kijabe and
Moses ole Kuya said they left the area
due to frequent attacks which had
claimed five lives in the past two weeks.
Police were yesterday sent to the area
after a series of gun attacks and cattle
raids.
Villager Simeon ole Makala told journalists
that the gangsters raided the area
on Monday night and harassed residents
before driving away the livestock.
And passengers in a car belonging to a
senior intelligence official escaped death
narrowly during the Easter weekend
after gangsters sprayed it with bullets
near Olesentu on the
Lolgorien-Kilgoris
highway.
Mr Kijabe’s driver
was killed by the gunmen
who shot him
near Olesentu trading
centre as he transported
milk to Kilgoris
town two weeks ago.
A senior officer from the provincial
CID offices in Nakuru is still investigating
the incident.
District commissioner Julius Mathenge
yesterday declared war on the
criminals and said that police would
hunt them down.
Mr Mathenge said those behind the
crimes would be arrested to answer for
their misdeeds. He appealed to residents
to report illegal gun holders to the
police, saying the
arms could fuel
conflict.
T r a n s M a r a
county council chairman
Daniel ole
Kokoyo said fear
had engulfed the
area.
“Five lives have been lost, highway
attacks targeting this area are on the
rise, 350 cows have been stolen, and still
the local CID boss walks with an empty
file. It is time police boss Hussein Ali
came to our rescue,” he said.
