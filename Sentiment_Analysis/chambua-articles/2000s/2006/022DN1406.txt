Boost war on graft, urges Bellamy

By NATION Reporter
The US ambassador yesterday said the
fight against corruption should start
from the top — just like the fight against
Aids.
President Kibaki initiated a campaign
against Aids by taking part in an advertisement
highlighting the need to combat
the disease.
The outgoing American ambassador,
Mr William Bellamy, also said Kenya
could have realised a higher economic
growth if corruption had been eradicated,
electricity and fuel prices reduced
and the road network improved.
He also said the US would be watching
how Kenya conducted its war on
corruption.
But he denied claims that the US was
forcing Kenya to enact a “foreign” antiterrorism
law.
“Whatever legislation Kenya produces
is Kenya’s. It is never going to be
an American law,” he said.
The envoy spoke when he met Vice-
President Moody Awori at his Jogoo
House office in Nairobi.
Mr Awori said Kenya had put structures
in place to fight the vice and the
results were evident. He said
corruption was not a Kenyan
problem but also developed
countries’.
The VP said resources were
required to strengthen institutions
that investigate and prosecute
corruption suspects, such
as the attorney-general’s office
and the Kenya Anti-
Corruption Commission.
The two said the campaign
against Aids had been successful
because the number of daily deaths had
reduced from 700 to 200 due to advocacy
and sensitisation programmes.
Mr Bellamy said his government
would continue assisting the Aids
campaign.
The Vice-President said politicians
would be encouraged to demonstrate
political will by either checking their
HIV status in public or visiting voluntary
counselling and testing centres.
Mr Bellamy said he was critical of the
Government because he wanted to protect
American interests.
“As an ambassador, it is my responsibility
as a representative of the US to
follow the politics of Kenya... It is
normal for ambassadors to
speak on issues,” he said.
“If it affects American
interests I speak, that is my
role... I learnt a phrase from
President Kibaki that you do
not need your enemies to tell
you something is wrong, you
need your friends.”
However, he said Kenya
needed a law to deal with the
threats of terrorism as the
country had been targeted
because it was a success story.
According to him, the US and other governments
were working to help Kenya to
protect itself.
Mr Awori said Kenya was a victim of
terrorism because of her friends like the
US which were also targeted.
“The attacks were meant to send a
message to America,” he said.
He said Kenyans could only accept
homegrown laws.
The VP said the country’s economic
growth would have been higher than 5.8
per cent were it not for the drought
which affected agricultural production
and criticised those claiming that the
effects of the growth had not trickled
down to the poor.
