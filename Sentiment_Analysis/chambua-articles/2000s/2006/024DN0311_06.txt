Knut officials to declare their HIV status

By NATION Correspondent
Officials of a teachers union would
declare their HIV status in public
during the World Aids Day to be
marked on December 1.
Thirty national executive council members
of the Kenya National Teachers
Union (Knut) made the resolve at the
end of a three-day workshop on Aids at
Plaza Beach Hotel in Mombasa.
They said declaring one’s HIV status in
public was the most effective way to
fight the spread of the pandemic in the
country.
Secretary-general Francis Ng’ang’a
announced that during
the World Aids Day, the
officials would conduct a
voluntary counselling
and testing clinic in Nairobi.
And Mr Ng’ang’a would
be the first teacher to
undergo the voluntary
test and others would
follow suit.
He said the trade union had decided to
take the bold step to encourage more
teachers to come out and declare their
status.
“We believe as teachers we must lead by
example, we are going to demonstrate
that we are committed to the fight
against HIV/Aids,” he said.
Mr Ng’ang’a also announced the union
had mandated its secretariat to meet
Teachers Service Commission officials
to harmonise the HIV/Aids policy at
work claiming the existing one by
employers was unfriendly and stigmatised
those affected.
He said the union would start a comprehensive
training on HIV/Aids for members
as they intensify their war against
the scourge.
The workshop was sponsored by the
American Federation of Teachers
