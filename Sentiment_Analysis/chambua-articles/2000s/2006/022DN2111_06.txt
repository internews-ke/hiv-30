Woman shot in
wedding clash
over HIV status

By JUMA NAMLOLA
A woman is fighting for her life in hospital
after she was shot by police in a violent
clash at a wedding.
The woman was hit by a bullet fired
by a police officer who was in a riot
squad trying to quell a confrontation
between the families of the groom and
bride over their HIV status before the
wedding in Mombasa on Saturday, said
police.
The woman, known as Mama Vero,
was shot in the back and the bullet
exited under her breast,
said Dr Khadija Shikelly,
the administrator at
the Coast Provincial
General Hospital.
“Her condition has
stabilised,” Dr Shikely
said by telephone
yesterday.
The woman, who is said to have been
in the bridal party, was shot near a
church in Bangladesh slum as relatives
and friends of the two families threw
stones at each other.
The busy Mombasa-Nairobi highway,
near the area, was temporarily closed.
The violence was sparked by the
bridegroom’s family, which protested at
the refusal by Pastor Steven Ouma of
Glory Worship Centre to solemnise the
union until the two produced their
HIV/Aids reports, said Mombasa police
boss Wilfred Mbithi.
The man failed to produce a report on
his HIV status and the pastor refused to
solemnise the marriage, said Mr Mbithi.
“The two families had agreed that
their children would tie the knot only
after undergoing HIV tests from reputable
voluntary counselling and testing
centres. The bride produced hers but
the groom dilly-dallied,” said Mr
Mbithi.
It was then that the bride’s family
insisted that the marriage ceremony
would only continue
after the groom’s results
were known.
But the groom’s family
tried to force the pastor
to play his role and
unite the two lovers,
which he refused.
“Annoyed and anxious
for the wedding to go on, some relatives
and friends of the groom became
rowdy and threatened to raze the
church,” said Mr Mbithi.
The church members sought help
from nearby police who rushed in to
quell the tension.
Police were shooting in the air to
scare the crowd, but a bullet hit the
woman who fell down bleeding, said Mr
Mbithi.
