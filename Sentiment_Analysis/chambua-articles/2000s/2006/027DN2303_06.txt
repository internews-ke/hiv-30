Stalking the Aids virus in Samburu

By Arthur Okwemba
With only a bag, a file and a pair of
strong legs, Daniel Ebongon
traverses the width and breath of
Samburu District hunting for the
Aids virus.
Ebongon, known locally as the ‘Hunter’ has
since December tested 231 people for HIV, giving
a full new meaning to mobile VCT.
Today, when we caught up with him, the Hunter,
had just walked over 25 kilometres to Lolkuniani
in Wamba division, where several Samburu
herdsmen and women had converged for the
market day.
“This is one day I never miss, it offers a unique
chance to meet a big group of people and possible
clients,” says Ebongon, who works for the Nomadic
Community Trust.
As the people go about trading, the Hunter moves
amongst them talking about the importance of
knowing their HIV status. Some who have not
heard of the virus are suspicious of his activities and
rarely warm up to his messages.
On the other hand, those who agree to be tested
are moved a few metres from the crowd where he
counsels them, before carrying out the test. Within
30 minutes, the clients get their results.
Some who are willing but too busy trading have to
be waited for, sometimes for as long as six hours
when they are through with business. But yet others
who are too busy have to be booked for the next
market day. Even with all this difficulties, Ebongon
is able to test three to four clients on every
market day.
During other days, he moves to various homesteads
educating the pastoralists about HIV and
testing any who are willing. Although it has been
difficult to cover a larger area, Ebongon will not
be the only one walking around this area in the
coming months.
Recently, the United Nations Population Fund,
which has been funding activities on the prevention
of HIV/Aids in the district, has trained people
who will, among things, carry out mobile VCT
