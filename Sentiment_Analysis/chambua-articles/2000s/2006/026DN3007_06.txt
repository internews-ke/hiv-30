Use of ICT lowers
cost of managing
medical records

By SAM WAMBUGU
Quite often when it comes to
Kenya's health system, the
infrastructure to support
and sustain information technology
systems is not available on a
regular basis, including regular
electricity supply, and workers
skilled in computer use.
Low power battery operated
devices such as hand-held can be
used where reliable electrical
power is not available.
In addition devices that can
store and forward information can
be used when regular connectivity
is not available. Import duties on
solar equipment and accessories
have been removed, including
deep cycle and sealed batteries
specifically for solar power,
throwing a life-line to areas where
electricity is still foreign.
ICT tools can improve the performance
of the health care service
delivery by providing quality
information in a timely manner to
providers, policy makers and the
donor community. It allows health
care providers to collect, store,
retrieve and transfer information
electronically.
It can also improve the timeliness
of data by reducing the
amount of data processing necessary
through automation, and the
speed at which data is reported to
higher levels through electronic
data transfer. Put together, this
may determine death or survival
of a patient.
Additionally, ICT tools can aid
in the collection of data at the
point of care, thereby reducing the
use of fault-prone paper-based
systems. This is already in use in
some high volume
health facilities
and facilities
supported by religious
organizations
and nongove
r n m e n t a l
organizations in
Kenya.
E l e c t r o n i c
medical records
(EMR), handheld
devices and
telemedicine can
aid providers in
managing their
patient care by
providing decision support in the
form of on-hand medical histories;
drug formularies, dosages,
and drug-to-drug interactions; and
peer-to-peer consultations.
There are multiple units within
the hospital that capture different
data. Healthcare workers can use
clinical information for diagnostic
and treatment purposes. Hospital
administrators are monitoring
such aspects as patient flow, the
need for supplies, and financial
operations of the facility. Other
staff may be focused on the
reporting of population health statistics
within and across hospital
facilities.
This more complex array of
data needs at the hospital level
increases the opportunities for
ICT to be applied. At the community
level, health information
has a bounty of benefits, including
providing data for decision making,
problem solving, planning
and resource tracking. For example,
care for orphans and children
made vulnerable by HIV/Aids is
by its very nature community and
ideally home-based.
It is general knowledge that the
most successful and effective care
is dependent upon the identification
of a potentially vulnerable
child, providing a medical and
social care plan before they are
orphaned, and continued afterward,
coupled with long term follow-
up that emphasizes preventing
the child from drifting to the
street.
The only way to do this successfully
is by employing an
active and competent electronic
information system that includes
surveillance of the needs of the
children in the community.
Early identification of potentially
vulnerable children is
tremendously enhanced when
such a system is connected to HIV
diagnostic and treatment programmes,
such as counselling and
testing, and home-based care
services.
In order for such a linkage
between children and HIV/Aids
treatment to be successful, respective
information systems must be
competent. Clinicians at health
facilities providing HIV/Aids care
rely on information that must be
accurate and reliable to ensure
effective patient management.
It is critical that treatment regimens
are followed to reduce the
likelihood of individuals developing
resistance to drugs, or worse
yet, the emergence of
a new drug-resistant
strain of HIV. Clinical
knowledge and treatment
management
must work with tools
to provide an opportunity
for evidencebased
medicine: a
robust health management
information system
is one of the tools.
Maintaining antiretroviral
therapy
(ART) records
involves having
detailed medical
records available at points of care.
Traditionally, this has been done
with a paper record stored at the
clinic, or carried by the patient.
However, there are advantages to
having the information electronically
since it can be retrieved
more easily, and the computer
programmes can provide intelligent
analysis and treatment
advice.
Stake holders in the health
industry must champion the establishment
of sound systems for collecting,
storing and analysing
medical information electronically.
