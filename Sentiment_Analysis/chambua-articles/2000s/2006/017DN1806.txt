Firms in Aids drive
Two local firms have joined hands with
the US Agency for International
Development (Usaid) to help communities
wracked by HIV/Aids.
Called Lifeworks, the partnership will
see Unilever and General Motors company
staff train beneficiaries in business
management skills for the next four years
at a cost of Sh35 million.
The project targets women and youth living
along the main truck routes in the
region who are "at greater risk of acquiring
HIV as a result of the high-risk
behaviours they engage in to make a living."
The agreement for the partnership was
signed by managing directors Bill Lay of
GM, Unilever's David Mureithi and
Usaid's deputy director Cheryl Anderson.
The agency has committed $45 million
(Sh3.2 billion) to the project.
