{"text": "Sunday Nation/April 9, 2006\r\n\r\nPositive and covered\r\n\r\nsunta Wagura, the iconic activist is\r\nfamiliar with the travails of HIV-positive\r\npeople trying to procure personal\r\nfinance products.\r\nOnly two years ago, a mortgage financier\r\nguillotined her application simply because she\r\nhad no life insurance cover.\r\n\"I only succeeded after I threatened to\r\nexpose the company.\r\nThe following day, they called and gave me\r\nthe mortgage unconditionally,\" she says.\r\nYet Ms Wagura's case is not that of a lone\r\nvoice crying in the wilderness. Indeed, there\r\nare many that simply go unheard.\r\nOver two decades after the first case of\r\nHIV/Aids was reported in Kenya, many of the\r\ncountry's 2.2 million positive people find themselves\r\nshut out of life insurance, and with it\r\nmany other personal finance products whose\r\nvendors insist on one passing \"the test\" as a\r\npre-condition.\r\nIt is a saga of hypocritical denial, livid fear,\r\noutright corporate greed, conservatism, and\r\nmost glaringly, lack of expertise among local\r\ninsurers to accurately price the HIV/Aids risk\r\nand (surprise!) even make a profit from underwriting\r\nit.\r\nMs Wagura\ufffdwho is the founder of the\r\nKenya Network of Women Living with Aids\r\n(Kenwa)\ufffdsays she gets at least three letters\r\nevery week from members complaining against\r\ndiscrimination by life insurers on the basis of\r\ntheir HIV status.\r\n\"Most insurers do not provide cover to Aids\r\npatients. They consider them high risk.\r\nThese people should not be discriminated\r\nagainst when they are shopping for life insurance.\r\nIt only deepens the stigmatization,\" she\r\nsays.\r\nBut there is hope yet in Kenya for HIV-positive\r\npeople seeking life insurance cover.\r\nTwo firms with a South African link\ufffd\r\nbacked by years of experience in a region\r\nwhich has one of the highest prevalence rates in\r\nthe world\ufffdare seeking to change this by coming\r\nup with products that do not lock them out.\r\nSA has six million people infected by the virus,\r\nthe highest in the world.\r\nPan Africa Life Assurance\ufffdthe local scion\r\nof Johannesburg-based African Life Assurance\r\nGroup (which has since been acquired by\r\nSanlam Limited)\ufffdhas been in Kenya since\r\n2001, following the mutation of the former Pan\r\nAfrican Insurance into two parts and the sale of\r\nits life division.\r\nBut Metropolitan, the latest kid on the local\r\nlife insurance block, just launched in Kenya a\r\nfortnight ago.\r\nFrom its base on the mezzanine floor of\r\nInternational Life House, CEO Linus Makhulo\r\ntalks with much conviction about its product\r\nsuite, which consists of both savings and risk\r\nmanagement brands.\r\n\"These are just the products that have been\r\nchosen for our assault on the Kenyan market.\r\nThere is more where this came from.\r\nOur Aids Solution Funder is an add-on to our\r\ncorporate products like group life cover and\r\ngroup funeral cover,\" he said in an interview.\r\nSince the product is sold as a form of value\r\nadded on Metropolitan's group covers, there is\r\nan inevitable red flag: the ultimate decision as\r\nto whether a HIV-positive person will get life\r\ninsurance or not, rests squarely with the\r\nemployer.\r\nThere is a limitation though as personal life\r\ncover is apparently not included, shutting out\r\nthe self-employed, a sizeable crowd in this\r\ncountry. And even in the case of those who\r\nhave a salaried job, it still depends on the\r\nrather precarious magnanimity of the employer.\r\nIt is the latter to apply for the cover and\r\nindicate that it includes the section of its workforce\r\nthat is HIV-positive, an increasingly\r\nlarge portion at many firms in Kenya.\r\nStill with changing employer perceptions\r\non Aids and greater hope for the same, Mr\r\nMakhulo is convinced this product will fly.\r\n\"Most firms have adopted a policy on Aids\r\nat the workplace. They are encouraging workers\r\nto declare their status. Some already provide\r\ncounselling and have ARV (anti-retrovirals)\r\ndispensing regimes.\r\nSuch companies will see our product as a\r\nnatural escalation of what they already have,\"\r\nthe youthful CEO, told BusinessSunday.\r\nBut the young actuary is under no illusions\r\nabout the gravity of the job at hand. In a generally\r\nconservative business environment,\r\nwhere most prefer the tried and beaten path to\r\nCONTINUED ON PAGE 18."}
