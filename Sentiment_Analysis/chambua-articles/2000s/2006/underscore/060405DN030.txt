{"text": "Daily Nation/ Wednesday, April 5, 2006\r\n\r\nStop AIDS, Keep the Promise:\r\nAligning Treatment and Prevention\r\nThe spread of HIV&AIDS remains a huge challenge to our community. The number of people living with HIV in Kenya totals\r\nto about 1.1 million adults between 15 and 49 years, another 60,000 aged 50 and over, and approximately 100,000 children.\r\nThe government of Kenya target of placing only 140,000 of eligible patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) by end of 2006 is\r\na drop in the ocean. The number of people with HIV/AIDS who require treatment immediately in Kenya is 250,000. The goal\r\nof providing treatment for all those who require it may be elusive unless there are concerted efforts by the government and\r\nother stakeholders in improving the existing health and social infrastructure.\r\nAt the same time, those who are not infected should be kept uninfected. In regard to the impact of HIV/ AIDS on the\r\neducation sector, we are turning a blind eye to the education needs and opportunities for orphans. There are teachers and\r\nstudents infected who are not receiving much needed attention among other groups who need care and support. We need\r\ngreater access to treatment and greater access to prevention now than ever before. The gains in reduction of national\r\nprevalence levels need to be appreciated. However, we should focus our attention to pockets of areas where these gains are\r\nbeing reversed.\r\nThis therefore poses a challenge to the government, donors, civil societies and HIV&AIDS service organisations to ensure\r\nthat both treatment and care for people living with HIV&AIDS and prevention services are provided side by side. While we\r\nappreciate donor funding, stand alone initiatives that enjoy little or no ownership by communities do not make much\r\ndifference in the long run. We need to ensure that both government and donor funded projects are designed to produce\r\ntangible results.\r\nEstablished in 1990 by a group of NGOs who had begun responding to the HIV&AIDS epidemic, Kenya AIDS NGOs\r\nConsortium (KANCO) continues to rally her members to address emerging challenges in responding to HIV&AIDS. Kenya\r\nAIDS NGOs Consortium (KANCO), a national network of NGOs, CBOs, and Faith Based Organisations involved in\r\nHIV&AIDS and STI activities in Kenya has been at the forefront in responding to HIV&AIDS and its impact.\r\nKANCO\ufffds response to the epidemic is guided by her mission to be a premier organisation committed to providing and\r\npromoting leadership, collaboration and enhancing capacity among Civil Society Organizations for collective action towards\r\neffective response to HIV&AIDS and its impact on the Kenya society. Currently with over 840 member organisations,\r\nKANCO has prioritised four key programme areas, which include:\r\n\ufffd Promoting HIV&AIDS Information Access and Documentation,\r\n\ufffd Capacity Building for members and other stakeholders,\r\n\ufffd HIV&AIDS Policy Development and Advocacy, and\r\n\ufffd Grant Making and Grant Management for its members geared towards improving the ability of these\r\norganisations to deliver vital HIV/AIDS services to those who need them in the community.\r\nThese programmes are geared towards promoting prevention for those who are not infected and providing treatment and\r\ncare for those living with HIV&AIDS. One such initiative aims at highlighting the need to continue linking prevention to\r\ntreatment. In the recent past, there has been an increase in access to (ART) or \ufffdtreatment\ufffd which has brought hope to many\r\npeople living with HIV&AIDS.\r\nIt has been realised that though treatment access has increased, several opportunities in its promotion have been missed.\r\nThere is need to make people aware of the process of getting drugs easily to avoid loosing them. This mainly happens\r\nbecause people are not aware of the opportunities existing or have inadequate support to enable them access counselling\r\nand testing, and treatment opportunities.\r\nWhat can you do? Simple, if in the neighbourhood you know of such people in need of HIV prevention and treatment\r\nservices, please talk to them and refer them to a nearby institution providing VCT services or one where you think the\r\ninfected person can get information on HIV testing and treatment if necessary.\r\nAs we encourage giving and caring for the needy in this season, you can help financially or seek support from your church or\r\nschool to help those affected and infected. We need to ensure that our brothers and sisters out there get support.\r\nPrevention efforts need to focus on people who have not been reached while maintaining the ones we have been working\r\nwith.\r\nFor any meaningful results to be achieved in the fight against HIV&AIDS, both prevention and treatment must have equal\r\nemphasis in policy-making, funding and service delivery levels. Prioritizing one over the others is counter productive in the\r\nlong run. This is because prevention and treatment initiatives are fundamentally interdependent. HIV treatment, care and\r\nsupport can be a gateway to prevention and vice versa.\r\nPrevention and treatment need to be linked in HIV&AIDS programming. In recent years policy makers and donors have shown\r\nsolid support for scaling up HIV treatment while downplaying prevention efforts. Failure to scale up prevention alongside\r\ntreatment could lead to increase in the infection rates thus placing more demand on treatment. Eventually, the number of\r\npeople requiring treatment will overwhelm providers of treatment services.\r\nTreatment makes prevention more effective while prevention makes treatment affordable.\r\nWhere both prevention and treatment programmes exist, they are not fully integrated in the community. Simultaneous\r\nexpansion and alignment of prevention and treatment initiatives needs to be understood and adopted by a cross section of\r\nstakeholders ranging from public, private and community sectors.\r\nHowever, for this to be achieved, it is important that all partners and stakeholders \ufffdKeep the Promise\ufffd. The government and\r\npolicy makers need to ensure they meet the targets they have committed to in the fight against HIV&AIDS. Some of these\r\nimportant promises are contained in the UNGASS Declaration of Commitment signed in June 2001, Millennium Development\r\nGoals, 3 by 5 Initiative by the World Health Organisation, and lately, the goal of Universal access to prevention, care, treatment\r\nand support for all people who require them by 2010.\r\nAchieving these commitments requires efforts from different stakeholders. Clear roles for all stakeholders need to be defined\r\nand challenging those responsible to be held accountable to fulfil their promise. Equitable allocation of resources to both\r\nprevention and treatment is a key ingredient in this process. Programmes targeting both prevention and treatment should also\r\nbe intensified. Diverse stakeholders including the government, donors and organisations working in HIV&AIDS need to\r\nempower communities to address issues of both prevention and treatment.\r\nGreater involvement of People Living with HIV&AIDS (PLWHAs) in programmes addressing issues of HIV&AIDS is paramount.\r\nThe role of PLWHAs is a critical component of this response. They form a vital part of the response to the epidemic since they\r\nare advocates for treatment access. Through their personal testimonies and experiences, they help to promote prevention and\r\ncommunity education on HIV&AIDS care and support.\r\nKANCO is striving to advocate for the improvement of prevention and treatment services for the most vulnerable groups in\r\nthe community including youth and women. Various undertakings including training on prevention and treatment, stigma\r\nreduction campaigns, referral services and resource mobilisation to support local communities are some of the major activities\r\nthat KANCO has conducted in supporting aligning of prevention to treatment. KANCO hopes to intensify provision of\r\ninformation, advocacy and networking among NGOs, CBOs,\r\nFaith Based Organisations and other stakeholders for\r\ncomprehensive HIV&AIDS prevention and treatment in Kenya.\r\nWe need to keep focus on the trends of the epidemic while\r\nworking together. \ufffdLets Stop AIDS, Lets Keep the Promise.\ufffd\r\nKANCO manages four established HIV/AIDS Resource\r\nCentres in Nairobi, Mombasa, Nakuru and Kakamega which\r\nacquire, process, repackage and desseminate practical, relevant\r\nand up-to-date HIV & AIDS information. The resource centres\r\noffer advice on how to access HIV & AIDS services as well as\r\nanswer peoples concerns in relation to HIV & AIDS including\r\nwhere you can get tested or access ARVs. The resource\r\ncentres also contain a special collection for women developed\r\nin collaboration with USAIDs \ufffdWomen and AIDS Resource\r\nCentre.\ufffd\r\nThe resource centres are open to AIDS Service organisation\r\nand the public.
