{"text": "Sunday Nation/June 25, 2006\r\nOrphan sees\r\nhairdressing\r\nas window\r\nout of poverty\r\n\r\nBy WARUGURU MUCHIRA\r\nRosemary Kabura is a\r\nhappy 19 year-old.\r\nDespite she and her four\r\nsiblings being orphaned,\r\nand having to depend on their\r\naunt\ufffds support for the past three\r\nyears, she can now earn a certificate\r\nin hair dressing, which gives\r\nher greater hope in the future.\r\nMr Josiah Gatuni, 23, is also a\r\nresident of Korogocho. He finished\r\nhis \ufffdO\ufffd level studies last year\r\nand attained a C-.\r\nAfter this, he spent a lot of time\r\nloitering in the sprawling\r\nKariobangi estate.\r\nThe eldest in a family of three,\r\nhe is currently supporting his sister\r\nthough a small video shop,\r\nwhile his younger brother lives\r\nupcountry.\r\nNow he wants to study hairdressing,\r\nand perhaps make a reasonable\r\nliving out of it.\r\nBoth Ms Kabura and Mr Gatuni\r\namong 52 students benefiting\r\nfrom a project run by World\r\nVision, an international non-governmental\r\norganisation, and\r\nAshleys Hair and Beauty\r\nAcademy as part of its Kariobangi\r\nHIV Project.\r\nThe project aims at providing\r\nyouth orphaned by HIV/Aids with\r\nskills.\r\nIn a memorandum of understanding\r\nbetween the two organisations,\r\nWorld Vision will pay a\r\ntotal of Sh1.04 million for the\r\nduration of the course which is\r\nSh20,000 per student while\r\nAshleys will subsidize the remaining\r\nSh25,000 at a total cost of\r\nSh1.3 million for 2006.\r\nThe training lasts six months,\r\ncovering various aspects of hair\r\ndressing.\r\n\"If World Vision was not\r\naround, my aunt would have had\r\nto struggle to see how I would get\r\ncollege,\" shares Ms Kabura.\r\n\"Now I can help my younger\r\nones and I promised I won\ufffdt let her\r\ndown,\" she says in reference to her\r\nthree younger siblings one of\r\nwhom is in Form 2, while the others\r\nare in Standard Eight and\r\nStandard One respectively.\r\n\"When I was in school, I was\r\ninterested in hair,\" says Mr\r\nGatuni. He relied on his aunt for\r\nhis secondary school fees.\r\n\"The school has a good foundation\r\nwith an international certificate,\r\nand I know I have a good\r\nchance to work in a good salon,\"\r\nhe says, sharing his future plans.\r\nHe reveals that Ashleys has\r\npromised the top four graduating\r\nstudents employement in the salon\r\nand barber shop, \"I am working\r\nvery hard to be one of them.\"\r\nAccording to the academy's\r\ndirector and principal, Terry\r\nMungai, the seeds for the school\r\nwere sown early this year, when\r\nWorld Vision approached her to\r\nsupport its Kariobangi programme.\r\n\"The challenging part is how\r\nmuch they were willing to give,\r\nbut for me I believe that when you\r\ngive more, you get more,\" she\r\nrecounts.\r\nWith Sh1.3 million paid upfront\r\nby World Vision as their contribution,\r\nMs Mungai was able to\r\nsecure a suitable location in\r\nKariobangi.\r\n\"It was important that we bring\r\nthe school close to the students, so\r\nthat they do not have to incur costs\r\nof transport and miss classes or\r\narrive late.\"\r\nMs Mungai also stocked the\r\nschool with hair care and beauty\r\nproducts for the practical lessons.\r\n\"We had to make the purchase\r\nat once because we just get the\r\none off payment, whereas in town\r\nit is continuous,\" she says comparing\r\nthe operations of the school\r\nbased in town. \"Even though we\r\nare in Kariobangi, we have to\r\nmaintain standards and keep the\r\nimage.\"\r\nThe school comprises two\r\nclassrooms and a salon where the\r\nstudents undertake their practical\r\nsessions.\r\nThe salon is also open to external\r\nclients, and the students earn a\r\ncommission on every client they\r\nservice.\r\nThe school spirit has also had\r\nan impact on the students. As Ms\r\nKabura says, \"Here we pray and\r\nworship and I know by the end of\r\nthe six months, many of our lives\r\nwill have changed.\"\r\nMs Mungai is determined that\r\nher students will make something\r\nof themselves, and she often gives\r\nthem motivational talks: \"I tell\r\nthem they should not let their\r\nenvironment limit them because\r\nyou are as big or as small as you\r\nthink you are.\"\r\nMs Kabura dreams of eventually\r\nbecoming a professional cosmetologist.\r\n\"When I get a job, I\ufffdd\r\nlike to support the others.\"\r\nMs Mungai says that their practical\r\nexperience will go a long\r\nway in gearing them towards success.\r\n\"The salon is very important,\r\nbecause they are already gaining\r\nexperience of the workplace. Most\r\nsalons pay on commission so the\r\nmore clients you have, the more\r\nyou make,\" says Ms Mungai. The\r\ncommission is paid on weekly\r\nbasis.\r\nWith knowledge on how to provide\r\ngood services and treat their\r\ncustomers well, thus retaining\r\nthem, the partnership project\r\nhopes that the HIV orphans will\r\nbe able to uplift their lives and\r\nthose of their families."}
