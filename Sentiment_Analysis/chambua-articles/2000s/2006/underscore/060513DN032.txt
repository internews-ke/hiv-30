{"text": "SATURDAY NATION\r\nMay 13, 2006\r\nAids jelly trials start in Kenya\r\nNew cream for women aimed at minimising chances of HIV infection\r\n\r\nBy JEFF OTIENO\r\nA new anti-Aids jelly aimed at minimising\r\nchances of HIV infection is already\r\nunder trial in Kenya.\r\nThe tests have started in Thika, Mombasa,\r\nNandi Hills and Nairobi.\r\nAccording to Kenya Medical\r\nResearch Institute director Davy Koech,\r\nthe areas were chosen for their wide difference\r\nin HIV prevalence rates.\r\n\ufffdSome of the regions have high HIV\r\nprevalence, while others have low prevalence.\r\nThis will enable us to come up\r\nwith better results,\ufffd said Dr\r\nKoech.\r\nThe gel is applied in a\r\nwoman\ufffds genitals to protect\r\nher against HIV and other\r\nsexually transmitted\r\nviruses.\r\nWhile confirming the\r\nexercise, Health minister\r\nCharity Ngilu said the gel\r\nwould enable women to\r\ntake control of themselves.\r\n\ufffdAt the moment, condoms\r\nare controlled by\r\nmen, and that is why we welcome the\r\ntrials,\ufffd said Mrs Ngilu after opening a\r\nhealth meeting at a city hotel.\r\nThe trials are conducted by Kemri in\r\ncollaboration with the International\r\nPartnership for Microbicides (IPM).\r\nA team of scientists from the two\r\norganisations have visited Mombasa to\r\ninspect the trial sites.\r\nIndividuals will be divided into two\r\ngroups, with one given the gel and the\r\nother a placebo (sham therapy).\r\nThe two groups which will also\r\ninclude people of high risk behaviour,\r\nwill then be studied over several years.\r\nHowever, Dr Koech declined to state\r\nthe number of individuals involved in\r\nthe study, saying it was early.\r\n\ufffdWe will announce the figures of people\r\ninvolved in the study later,\ufffd he said.\r\nAccording to the researchers, it will\r\ntake five to seven years before the efficacy\r\nof the gel is ascertained.\r\nLarge scale experiments on the same\r\ngel are being conducted in South Africa,\r\nRwanda and Tanzania.\r\nTo come up with an effective medicine,\r\nIPM chief executive officer Zeda\r\nRosenberg said thousands of women\r\nhad to be involved in the trials. But she\r\nwarned that the gel had risks of failure,\r\njust like any other contraceptive.\r\n\ufffdThis is not a magic tool in the\r\nprevention of HIV. That\ufffds why\r\nresearch on vaccines must continue,\ufffd\r\nMs Rosenberg said.\r\nShe said those being recruited\r\nfor the exercise must be informed\r\nof the risks involved, and their\r\nconsent sought in advance.\r\nIt is believed that the availability\r\nof effective microbicides \ufffd in\r\nform of gels, foams and creams \ufffd\r\nwould greatly empower women\r\nto protect themselves and their\r\npartners.\r\nSome microbicides provide a\r\nphysical barrier to keep HIV and other\r\npathogens from reaching the target cells.\r\nOthers enhance the natural defences of\r\nthe reproductive organ by maintaining\r\nan acidic pH and stripping the cover of\r\nthe disease causing pathogens.\r\nMrs Ngilu said Kenya had achieved a\r\nlot in the anti-Aids campaign, adding\r\nthat prevalence rates had declined from\r\n14 per cent in 1999 to 6.1.\r\nBut UN special envoy for HIV/Aids\r\nStephen Lewis, said African countries\r\nhad done little. \ufffdIt\ufffds been difficult to\r\nchange behaviour, especially that of\r\nmales,\ufffd he said.\r\nSee Editorial on Page 8"}
