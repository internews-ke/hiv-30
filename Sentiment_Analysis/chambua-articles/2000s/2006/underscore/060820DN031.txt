But Health Minister\r\nManto Tshabalala-Msimang still\r\nquestions antiretrovirals and\r\ninstead promotes home-grown\r\nremedies such as olive oil, beetroot\r\nand garlic. She says they\r\nboost nutrition and immune\r\nresponse but activists say her\r\nprescription leads to thousands\r\nof deaths every year.\r\n\ufffdIt is the only country in\r\nAfrica whose government continues\r\nto propound theories\r\nmore worthy of a lunatic fringe\r\nthan of a concerned and compassionate\r\nstate,\ufffd Mr Lewis said on\r\nFriday.\r\nMr Mbeki\ufffds ruling ANC signalled\r\nit had no plans to revise its\r\nstrategy issuing a statement on\r\nFriday savaging the Treatment\r\nAction Campaign, South Africa\ufffds\r\nAids activist group which led\r\ncriticism of Tshabalala-Msimang\r\nat the Toronto conference. \ufffd\r\nReuters\r\nMr Lewis"}
