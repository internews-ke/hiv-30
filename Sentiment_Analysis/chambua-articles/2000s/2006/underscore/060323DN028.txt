At the moment, there is an\r\ninnovative condom distribution\r\nsystem, which is supposed to\r\nwork hand in hand with the\r\nmobile VCT strategy.\r\nBecause of the pastoralism lifestyle,\r\nUNFPA is facilitating the\r\ndistribution of condoms through\r\ndispensers placed on tree\r\nbranches along strategic routes.\r\nThis enables men to pick these\r\ncondoms as they go about their\r\ndaily activities.\r\n\ufffdThe best strategy to intervene\r\nin the prevention and\r\nmanagement of\r\nHIV/Aids in areas\r\nlike Samburu is coming\r\nup plans that fit\r\nwell with the way of\r\nlife of these people,\ufffd\r\nsays Judy Karogo of\r\nUNFPA.\r\nWith the walking\r\nVCT and condom dispensers\r\npatched on\r\ntrees, there is hope to\r\nreduce HIV prevalence from the\r\ncurrent 8.1 per cent. \ufffdBut easier\r\nsaid than done,\ufffd says Ebongon\r\nAt times when he\r\ngoes for a prior\r\nappointment he\r\nmight find the client\r\nhas moved, in\r\nwhich case he has to\r\ntrack them down\ufffd\r\na herculean task.\r\nThe other challenge\r\nis that people are\r\ndemanding to be\r\ngiven ARVs before\r\nthey agree to be\r\ntested. The situation becomes\r\nmore difficult as those found to\r\nbe HIV positive constantly follow\r\nhim wanting to be provided with\r\nthe drugs.\r\nAlthough some of the hospitals in\r\nthe district have ARVs, those\r\ninfected have to walk for over 50\r\nkilometres to reach the nearest\r\ncentre.\r\nA number of his clients who came\r\nfor pre-test counselling have\r\nfailed to return for post-test counselling;\r\nwhile others have never\r\nreturned for another test after the\r\nthree months window period.\r\nThe situation is equally difficult\r\nfor him when he tries to convince\r\nhis relatives friends and acquaintances\r\nto be tested. \ufffdSome of\r\nthese people fear that confidentiality\r\nwill be compromised and\r\nwould rather have the test done\r\nby a stranger.\ufffd\r\nDespite all these difficulties,\r\nmobile VCT centres are being\r\ntouted as the best strategy in\r\nreaching out to as many people as\r\npossible in the rural areas and\r\ncommunities living in extreme\r\nremote areas.\r\nIn a recent interview, Dr Kevin\r\nDeCock, former director of the\r\nUS Centres for Disease Control\r\nin Kenya, said establishing VCT\r\ncentres in areas where people are\r\ndispersed was going to be a waste\r\nof resources.\r\nHe argued that the use of mobile\r\nVCT centres which are operated\r\nby people not from the community\r\nwhere the tests are being\r\ndone would be the best way forward.\r\n\ufffdAWC Features"}
