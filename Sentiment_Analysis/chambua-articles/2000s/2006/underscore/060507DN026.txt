{"text": "Sunday Nation/ May 7, 2006\r\nI\ufffdm married? But I can\ufffdt tell this man from Adam!\r\n\r\nMail-order brides; the mass\r\nhysteria of the Rev Moon in\r\nSouth Korea; child brides;\r\nthey all must feel this way.\r\nOne day you are a happy (or\r\nnot so happy) young woman\r\nliving out your life. The next day, you are a bride.\r\nAnd sometimes you don\ufffdt even know it.\r\nFrom the Indian sub-continent, through many\r\ntraditional African communities, to parts of\r\nIslamic doctrine, reluctant brides have been\r\ngiven for ages, yet the latest permutation of the\r\npractice has many women in Southern Africa\r\npanic-stricken.\r\nLike elsewhere in the world, marrying a local is\r\nthe easiest way of getting Permanent Residence\r\nin South Africa. With residence, one can participate\r\nin almost every aspect of life, save for voting.\r\nSo, men with foreign passports in their pockets\r\nand fear of their homelands in their hearts, try\r\nevery which way to walk down the proverbial\r\naisle with the Nosimos, Nandiphas and Nosilelas\r\nof this world. Except that often, the objects of\r\naffection don\ufffdt even have a clue.\r\nRecent investigations in South Africa\ufffds\r\nDepartment of Home Affairs reveal that corrupt\r\nemployees have been finagling Identity Numbers\r\nof unsuspecting wenches from the national data\r\nbank and passing them on to foreigners from all\r\nwalks of life \ufffd but mostly Bangladeshi, Egyptians,\r\nPakistanis, Chinese and Nigerians (no surprise\r\nthere).\r\nOnce in possession of ID details, the \ufffdbridegroom\ufffd\r\nand conniving Home Affairs officer proceed\r\nto hold a civil ceremony with the absent\r\nbride, despite an explicit South African\ufffdand\r\nprobably world-wide\ufffdlaw that requires wouldbe\r\nbrides and grooms to be domiciled in the same\r\nroom for a wedding to be legal.\r\nAnyway, after the false champagne and honeymoon,\r\nthe chap applies for Permanent Residence\r\nas the spouse of a South African citizen and he\ufffds\r\nin the clear from there on. His \ufffdwife\ufffd does not\r\neven have to know about it.\r\nThat is in the ideal world of course. In the real\r\nworld, most of the victims of these sham marriages\r\neventually discover to their horror that they are\r\n\ufffdmarried\ufffd or are committing \ufffdbigamy\ufffd . Probably\r\nas a function of its former police-state status, South\r\nAfrica has the most intrusive government bureaucracy\r\nof any African country, and often requires all\r\nmen, women and children to have some form of ID\r\non them at all times. The most useful one \ufffd and\r\nmost coveted by foreigners \ufffd is a green Identity\r\nDocument book that all South Africans get as a\r\nbirth right.\r\nIn it is a name, picture and a 13-digit number that\r\nstarts with the year in which the person was born.\r\nThe ID book has a computerised barcode and is\r\nextremely difficult to forge. But it\ufffds a product of\r\nhuman ingenuity, so c\ufffdmon! Crooks with little incentive\r\nfor getting a real job will always find a way. And\r\nthat\ufffds where the false brides come in.\r\nAnyone who has ever attempted divorce knows\r\nhow traumatic and terrifying it is. It\ufffds even more so\r\nfor the young women who go to Home Affairs to\r\nreplace lost ID books or to register their real marriages,\r\nonly to be told that they were married, and\r\nhad different\ufffdoften foreign\ufffdsurnames! With close\r\nto 4,000 fake marriages uncovered over the last five\r\nyears, this can hardly be considered a crisis. However,\r\nbecause most women don\ufffdt routinely visit Home\r\nAffairs to check on their marital status, the official\r\nfigures are estimated to be off the mark by tens of\r\nthousands.\r\nIt\ufffds not like all the women are innocent either. It\ufffds\r\nbeen suggested that some have actually participated\r\nin the said sham marriages (a practice that is common\r\nin the US) and have been handsomely compensated.\r\nBut unlike in the US (rent Green Card\r\nwith Andie MacDowell and Gerard Depardieu)\r\nwhere American women are often well-motivated to\r\nbreak the law against false marriage, most of their\r\npoorer cousins in South Africa often have little say\r\nin the matter.\r\nNaturally, the women\ufffds lobby is fighting back.\r\nThey\ufffdve forced the Department of Home Affairs to\r\ndisplay a \ufffdScam Marriage\ufffd\ufffd poster in every one of its\r\noffices across South Africa. They\ufffdve threatened to\r\nsue the government if it grants victims of fake marriages\r\na divorce instead of annulling the marriage.\r\nAnd they\ufffdve forced through a new law that requires\r\nall foreigners who marry South African citizens to\r\nwait for five years before they can apply for Permanent\r\nResidence.\r\nTheir hope is that this would kill off the incentive\r\nfor \ufffdmarrying into\ufffd the country since it\ufffds almost\r\nimpossible to keep up appearances for that long.\r\nBut what, you might wonder, tempts men to go to\r\nthese illegal lengths to acquire legal status in foreign\r\nlands? Most are escaping extreme poverty (Pakistan\r\nand Bangladesh), repression (Egypt and China) or a\r\ncombination of both.\r\nTo people fleeing from these lands, it doesn\ufffdt\r\nreally matter that South Africa has unemployment\r\nrates of close to 50 percent, that its cities are some of\r\nmost unsafe, or that the HIV/Aids pandemic has\r\nbeen so devastating it is projected to shave 10 million\r\noff the country\ufffds census figures by 2030. In almost\r\nevery respect also, South Africa will never be the\r\nUS, or Western Europe where asylum seekers are\r\nalmost always guaranteed a monthly cheque, free\r\nhousing as well as free education and health insurance.\r\nStill, stealing other (especially poor women\ufffds)\r\nidentities is not the best way of winning friends.\r\nThese women have often endured traumatic lives\r\nthemselves. Many grew up in broken homes devastated\r\nby apartheid practices that condemned\r\ntheir men to early graves, a generation in exile, or\r\nlong periods in detention.\r\nToday, there are precious few families of black\r\nSouth Africans that experienced what we can simplistically\r\nrefer to as a normal family life with a\r\nman, his wife and their children living under the\r\nsame roof for, say, 20 years.\r\nIn the years since the end of apartheid, many\r\nwomen have had to depend on the state for their\r\nvery survival because they have no skills, no land,\r\nand no capital. Many are eligible for Disability\r\ngrants, Pension or Child allowances given to single\r\nmothers. To these women, the ID book is their\r\nlife and to take it away is to condemn them to\r\ndeath.\r\nIncidentally, it\ufffds often fellow South Africans,\r\nnot foreigners, who are most at fault. It is the wellpaid\r\nHome Affairs employees who steal ID numbers\r\noff the national data bank. It\ufffds they who help\r\npreside over bogus marriages; they who issue fake\r\nmarriage certificates; and they who expedite the\r\nPermanent Residence process. And it\ufffds they who\r\npocket the millions of Rands that oil these operations\r\neach year.\r\nIn contrast to most other Africans in government\r\nemploy (excepting our avaricious Members\r\nof Parliament), South African bureaucrats are\r\nwell-compensated indeed. So doing their job this\r\nbadly must be a manifestation of a different\r\nmalaise.\r\nStill, whatever happened to marrying for love?\r\nskyazze@hotmail.com"}
