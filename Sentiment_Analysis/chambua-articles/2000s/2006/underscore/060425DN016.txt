{"text": "Daily Nation/ Tuesday, April 25, 2006\r\n\r\nHopes for\r\nnew gel\r\nin war\r\non Aids\r\n\r\nCAPE TOWN, Monday\r\nResearchers are closing in on a breakthrough\r\nmicrobicide gel to help prevent\r\nHIV infection in women, scientists said\r\non Monday, but a lack of funding by\r\nmajor pharmaceutical companies is hampering\r\nresearch.\r\n\ufffdI think for many years the microbicides\r\nresearch field was a little bit tentative\r\nabout making too much noise about\r\nthe potential of this technology,\ufffd Ms\r\nHelen Rees, executive director of South\r\nAfrica\ufffds Reproductive Health and HIV\r\nResearch Unit, said on the sidelines of\r\nan international conference in Cape\r\nTown.\r\n\ufffdAt this point the microbicides\r\nresearch field is feeling that there might\r\nwell be the possibility of having an effective\r\nmicrobicide in the next few years,\ufffd\r\nshe told Reuters.\r\nMicrobicides cover a range of vaginal\r\nand rectal creams, gels or suppositories\r\nthat kill microbes and aim to cut the\r\ntransmission of HIV and possibly other\r\nsexually transmitted diseases when\r\napplied before sex.\r\nIf proven successful, they could provide\r\na powerful prevention tool for Aids\r\nand one that, unlike condoms, can be\r\ndirectly controlled by women. Five\r\npotential microbicide products are in\r\nadvanced clinical trials and scientists say\r\nthe first results should be made public\r\nwithin two years.\r\nMs Rees, a co-chair of the Cape Town\r\nconference, said the trials and other new\r\nproducts, many of them being tested in\r\nSouth Africa \ufffd the country hardest hit\r\nby Aids \ufffdoffered exciting prospects for\r\na scientific breakthrough. \ufffdThere are a\r\nlot of new products coming through the\r\npipeline, new molecules and exciting\r\nnew potential products that look, in the\r\nlaboratory and in animal models, as if\r\nthey will probably be even more effective\r\nagainst HIV,\ufffd she said. \ufffdWhat we\r\nwill see as the months and years go by\r\nare some of these products being formulated\r\nand moving rapidly into the clinical\r\ntrial phases.\ufffd (Reuters)"}
