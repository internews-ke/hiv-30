{"text": "24 Daily Nation/Thursday, January 19, 2006\r\n\r\nNew Aids vaccine trials\r\nare launched in Nairobi\r\n\r\nsub-types, A, B, and C. Almost 65 per cent of all\r\nHIV infections in Kenya and Sub-Saharan Africa\r\nare subtype A ; C is predominant in Southern\r\nAfrica and India, with B circulating mostly in\r\nAmerica, Japan, Australia, the Caribbean and\r\nEurope.\r\nTo make it potent, the vaccine is designed to\r\nattack the virus from two levels. On one level, it is\r\nexpected to elicit neutralising antibodies that will\r\ndisable the two key proteins \ufffd gp120 and gp41 \ufffd\r\nthat enable the virus to infect a cell.\r\nFor those viruses that will not be destroyed by\r\nthe antibodies and end up infecting the cell, then\r\nthe second level, the Cellular Immune Response,\r\nwill come into play.\r\nIn this case, when the infected cell takes a certain\r\nform, the immune cells, especially the killer\r\nT-cells, will be alerted and respond by killing it\r\nbefore the virus replicates and infects more cells.\r\nWhile most of the vaccines which have been\r\ntested so far are designed to induce a cellular\r\nimmune response, it has remained a very tricky\r\narea for scientists.\r\nA vaccine that elicits antibodies, although seen\r\nas the best way out, has also posed challenges to\r\nthe scientific community.\r\nRecent studies have shown, however, that a\r\nvaccine that is capable of neutralising antibodies as\r\nwell as cellular immune response is the best way\r\nout. And that is why the NIH settled on the current\r\nvaccine.\r\nThe institution first tested the vaccine among\r\nAmericans in 2004 before moving the testing to\r\nother countries.\r\nMost international scientific research institutions\r\nare taking this route to avoid being accused\r\nof using people in developing world as guinea pigs\r\nin their studies.\r\nThey are then safe if they test vaccines in their\r\nhome countries before doing so among populations\r\nin developing countries.\r\nTrials on the same vaccine began last December\r\nin Rwanda, with another 15 expected to carry similar\r\ntrials on the same vaccine candidate.\r\nIn Kenya, Walter Reed, the American Army\r\nResearch arm which works in collaboration with\r\nKenya Medical Research Institute (Kemri), is one\r\nsuch other site that is planning to start trials on this\r\nparticular vaccine in Kericho.\r\nAlready, it is understood that preparations are at\r\nan advanced stage, with the researchers having\r\nscreened hundreds of people in Kericho to establish\r\nHIV prevalence and incidence in the\r\narea.\r\nIf the phase one trials are successful,\r\nKavi will move to phase 2A that is\r\nlikely to look at the vaccine\ufffds dosage\r\nlevels. Volunteers to be involved in this\r\nphase will also be those at low-risk of\r\ncontracting HIV.\r\nBut when the trials move to phase\r\n2B, where the vaccine\ufffds efficacy is to be\r\nproved, those to participate as volunteers\r\nwill be people at high risk of contracting\r\nthe virus.\r\nAlready, Kangemi slums have been\r\nchosen as the ideal setting for the final\r\ntrial. For the past two years, Kavi has\r\nbeen carrying out studies on HIV prevalence\r\nand incidence among slum and\r\nresidents of the neighbouring estates.\r\nIn the event the vaccine is proven\r\neffective after the Kangemi trials, the\r\neffort will have wiped out the disappointment\r\nthat met the failure of the\r\nearlier Nairobi and Oxford universities\r\nvaccine trials.\r\nTrials on that earlier vaccine were\r\ndiscontinued last year when the results\r\nindicated that, of the 86 volunteers vaccinated\r\nsince 2001 in Kenya and Uganda,\r\nthe immune response rate was not\r\ngreater than 25 per cent.\r\nIn Britain, where 119 volunteers\r\nwere vaccinated, only 18 per cent\r\nimmune responses were registered.\r\nThis was far below the 60 per cent\r\nmark that IAVI and its scientific advisory\r\ncommittee had considered the benchmark\r\nfor a vaccine to warrant efficacy trials.\r\nAt that time, Kambili said: \ufffdWe have not found\r\ngood evidence from this vaccine that would make\r\nus invest in it and move forward. So we have\r\ndecided to work with the Kenyan team to conduct\r\ntrials on other vaccines we have in the pipeline.\ufffd\r\n\ufffd An AWC-Feature"}
