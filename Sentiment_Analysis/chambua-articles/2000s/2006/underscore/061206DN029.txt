Mr Gary Hoffman,\r\nthe head of corporate responsibility\r\nat Barclays told a\r\nconference co-hosted by\r\nUNICEF to mark World Aids\r\nDay that the work that the\r\nbank was doing on the ground\r\nin Africa was changing and\r\nsaving lives.\r\n\ufffdFor our employees its really\r\nimportant we look after them.\r\nTheres one territory in Africa\r\nwhere nearly four out of 10\r\nBarclays employees are HIV\r\npositive. That\ufffds clearly a serious\r\nissue for families and a\r\nserious issue for business, in\r\nterms of absence.\ufffd\r\nBarclays says that GDP rates\r\nacross the continent will fall\r\nunless companies do more. Mr\r\nHoffman predicted that in\r\nSouth Africa alone growth\r\nrates could fall by 1.5 per cent\r\na year, unless more was done."}
