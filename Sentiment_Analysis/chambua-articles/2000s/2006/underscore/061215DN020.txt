{"text": "DAILY NATION\r\nFriday December 15, 2006\r\n\r\nSwazi nurses flee Aids duties\r\n\r\nUN estimates the national\r\ninfection rate of people aged\r\n15 at 49 at 33.4 per cent\r\n\r\nMBABANE, Thursday\r\nWill the last nurse on duty\r\nplease turn off the\r\nlights?\ufffd reads a handwritten\r\nnote at a clinic\r\nin Manzini, Swaziland\ufffds\r\nAids-hit commercial\r\ncentre, 35km southeast of the capital,\r\nMbabane.\r\nThe wry note disguises the pain of\r\nthe country\ufffds diminishing number of\r\nnurses and hints at the reason why\r\ntheir colleagues have fled the country to\r\noffer their services elsewhere.\r\n\ufffdThe working conditions, the lack of\r\nbasic necessities to treat people and all\r\nthe dying: it\ufffds demoralising,\ufffd said a\r\nnurse, 28, who asked that her name not\r\nbe used. \ufffdIt\ufffds not just the money - it is\r\nhard to watch people die and you are\r\nhelpless to do anything about it because\r\nthere are no drugs or other things [to\r\ntreat them].\ufffd\r\nWorking in a poorly lit ward with\r\nscant equipment and a chronic shortage\r\nof drugs, are as much a motivation\r\nto leave the country as any promise of\r\ngreater financial reward in Europe, the\r\nUS or neighbouring South Africa.\r\nIn the emergency room of Manzini\ufffds\r\nRaleigh Fitkin Memorial Hospital, a\r\nchild screams as a nurse removes\r\nsutures from a stitched finger wound. \ufffdI\r\nhaven\ufffdt got the proper cutter \ufffd they\r\nhave such scissors in the paediatric\r\nward,\ufffd said the nurse as she gouged the\r\ntender skin around the wound with\r\nlarge scissors not intended for this\r\nprocedure.\r\nIn a recent report, \ufffdPublic sector\r\nnurses in Swaziland: can the downturn\r\nbe reversed?\ufffd released by Human\r\nResources for Health, an on-line medical\r\njournal published in collaboration\r\nwith the World Health Organisation,\r\nauthors Katharina Kober and Wim Van\r\nDamme noted: \ufffdThe public health sector\r\nin Swaziland faces a serious shortage\r\nof health workers: 44 per cent of\r\nposts for physicians, 19 per cent of\r\nposts for nurses and 17 per cent of nursing\r\nassistant posts are unfilled. We\r\nidentified emigration and attrition due\r\nto HIV/Aids as major factors depleting\r\nthe health workforce.\ufffd\r\nUNAids estimates the national HIV\r\ninfection rate of people aged 15 to 49 at\r\n33.4 per cent, the highest in the world.\r\nTwo-thirds of Swaziland\ufffds roughly one\r\nmillion people, ruled by sub-Saharan\r\nAfrica\ufffds last executive monarch, live on\r\n$2 or less per day.\r\nThe report concluded: \ufffdOur projections\r\nshow that both emigration and\r\nattrition due to HIV/Aids pose a serious\r\ndouble threat for Swaziland\ufffds\r\nhealth system, which, if not effectively\r\ntackled, would mean the loss of 44 per\r\ncent of the nursing workforce in the\r\npublic sector up to 2010.\ufffd\r\nNurses at St Theresa\ufffds, a clinic on\r\nthe outskirts of Manzini run by the\r\nRoman Catholic Church with financial\r\nsupport from government, last week\r\nheld a crisis meeting after two months\r\nof erratic salary payments or none at\r\nall.\r\n\ufffdIt is too hard doing what we do,\r\nunder these conditions that you see,\ufffd a\r\nnurse at the clinic told IRIN/PlusNews.\r\nAs a result of the government\ufffds policy\r\nof zero growth, no new posts were\r\ncreated in over 20 years, even with the\r\nonset of the HIV/Aids pandemic,\r\nwhich began to bite in the mid-1990s.\r\nThe WHO has put the total number of\r\nhealth workers posts at 3,726.\r\n\ufffdSome 758 of the 944 established\r\nnursing posts in the public and mission\r\nsectors are filled. The nurse-topopulation\r\nratio in the public and mission\r\nsectors is, therefore, around 70\r\nper 100,000. The official number of\r\nnursing posts was widely regarded as\r\ninadequate for the actual workload in\r\nthe health sector,\ufffd the Kober and Van\r\nDamme report commented.\r\nThe researchers said that 288 of the\r\n758 nurses, about 38 per cent,\r\nemployed in the public and mission\r\nsectors were probably HIV positive, of\r\nwhom 29, or 10 per cent, might have\r\ndied during 2005. They projected that\r\nthree to four per cent of the entire\r\nnursing workforce would succumb to\r\nAids-linked illnesses each year.\r\nHIV/Aids is a lesser contributor to\r\nthe country\ufffds nursing shortage than\r\nemigration. Researchers found that 100\r\nof the national nursing workforce of\r\nabout 800 leave the country annually.\r\nSwaziland\ufffds two nursing colleges produce\r\nabout 80 to 90 graduates a year,\r\nwhile a school for nursing assistants\r\ndelivers around 20 graduates.\r\nAlthough the two training sites\r\nreceive hundreds of applicants annually,\r\ntoo few student bursaries from the\r\nhealth and social welfare ministry, a\r\nlack of teaching staff and student\r\naccommodation, and insufficient opportunities\r\nfor practical training have kept\r\nenrolment low.\r\nA basic nursing course last three\r\nyears, but most students do either one\r\nadditional year to obtain a qualification\r\nin midwifery or a five-year Bachelor in\r\nNursing Sciences degree course.\r\n\ufffdI left nursing school and went right\r\nto work, like all my classmates. I worked\r\nat the Mbabane Government Hospital\r\n[the country\ufffds largest health facility],\r\nand right away I saw someone die\r\nbecause they couldn\ufffdt get the medicines\r\nthey needed. This is why Swaziland\r\nloses more nurses to \ufffdgreener pastures\ufffd,\r\nin my opinion. And Aids is making our\r\nwork so much harder,\ufffd the nurse said.\r\nThe Kober and van Damme report\r\nsaid 80 per cent of bed occupancy in the\r\nmedical and paediatric wards of government\r\nhospitals nationwide was\r\nHIV/Aids-related.\r\n\ufffdDoctors from a mission hospital\r\nestimated that five years ago they\r\nwould spend an average of five minutes\r\nper patient on a ward round, while\r\ntoday this was more likely to be 20 to\r\n30 minutes. There is an increased\r\ndemand for health services, and health\r\nworkers speak of feeling overwhelmed\r\nand burned out,\ufffd the authors said.\r\nOn a previous visit, Kober and Van\r\nDamme found that public and mission\r\nhealth facilities had 1,481 posts, but\r\nonly 1,184 staff were reported as actually\r\nworking at the facilities, leaving\r\n297, or 20 per cent, of the posts vacant.\r\nTo increase the number of nurses,\r\nthe Ministry of Health has requested\r\nthe Ministry of Public Service to lift a\r\nban on the recruitment of foreign nurses,\r\nwhose salaries would be paid by the\r\nGlobal Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis\r\nand Malaria.\r\nAnother solution to the shortage of\r\nnurses might come from government\ufffds\r\nrollout of antiretroviral drugs for people\r\nliving with HIV.\r\n\ufffdNo one wants to talk about it, but\r\nSwaziland\ufffds Aids problem is frightening\r\nnurses. We are on the frontline of this\r\nbattle, and it is easy for some to run\r\naway from the danger,\ufffd the nurse said.\r\n\ufffdIt takes real patriotism and a dedication\r\nto your calling as a nurse to work\r\nas a nurse in Swaziland today.\ufffd\r\n(afrol News)"}
