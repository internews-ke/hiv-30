{"text": "Daily Nation/Thursday, March 16, 2006\r\nWhen to care for Aids patients at home\r\n\r\nCONTINUED FROM PAGE 27\r\ntion most. I am still haunted by the skeletal figure\r\nof Makokha, in a foetal position on the floor, and\r\nteeth bared in pain each time there was an attempt\r\nto turn her. I feel that Makokha\ufffds mother must be\r\nequally haunted by the image of her once beautiful\r\ndaughter, whom she had to watch dying without\r\nprofessional nursing support.\r\nI am disturbed that the hospital withheld information\r\nregarding Makokha\ufffds HIV status, exposing\r\nher mother to possible infection. I also feel that,\r\nsuch knowledge would have improved the patient\ufffds\r\ncare.\r\nThe second Butere case was admitted at the Kisumu\r\nDistrict Hospital. Dan Omenda\ufffds* was diagnosed\r\nwith malaria and pneumonia, but before\r\nadmission he had tested HIV positive. But was surprisingly\r\ndischarged the next day.\r\nLater with a hilarious sense of humour, Omenda,\r\nwho was aware of his HIV status said as he laughed\r\nsarcastically on return to his sister\ufffds house in a Kisumu\r\nestate, \ufffdGo die home!\ufffd A sister who heard\r\nhim was horrified and demanded to know if that is\r\nwhat he had been told.\r\n\ufffdNo,\ufffd he said.\r\nBut whether or not the discharging doctor or\r\nnurse told him to go die at home is immaterial. The\r\npoint is that, Omenda, like Makokha, was just too\r\nweak to be discharged at that particular time.\r\nNo wonder he died three days after discharge.\r\nIf that is the care portrayed by both mission and\r\ngovernment hospitals, there is no wonder that Aids\r\npatients prefer to be sick within the comfort of the\r\nfamily members, since those who end up in hospitals\r\nare treated like untouchables.\r\nFaced with negative attitudes in hospitals, NGOs\r\nare now leading in making Aids patient care manageable\r\nat home, as I found out when I visited\r\nKicoshep (Kibera community self help program.), a\r\nnon governmental organisation for Aids patients,\r\nwhich has a hospital at Mashimoni Village just next\r\nto the railway line.\r\nMs Jane Kyove, 47, an HIV carrier, who has\r\ngone public, was brought to Nairobi a year ago by\r\nher nephew, on account of her illness. He paid her\r\nrent for six months before he stopped as it was\r\nproving to be too costly for him.\r\nMs Kyove, who has been admitted to hospital\r\ntwice before, says she prefers home based care\r\nbecause it gives her time to plan her work unlike in\r\nhospital, where her daily routine is restricted.\r\nSave for drugs, she describes being in the hospital\r\nas \ufffduseless\ufffd because even there, patients are still\r\ntaken care of by their friends and relatives.\r\nMs Kyove also knows patients who have died in\r\nhospital without a nurse anywhere near their beds.\r\nHer observation is that the nurses are overwhelmed\r\nby work.\r\nOn the other hand, Jane is not quite comfortable\r\nabout home based care. She was a patient attendant\r\nbefore falling sick, so she is conversant with infection\r\nand she fears for her Form Four school leaver\r\nwith whom she lives.\r\nShe fears that her daughter might contract Aids\r\nfrom handling her as they lack protective gloves.\r\nKicoshep only gives gloves to their volunteer care\r\ngivers.\r\nStill in Kibera, I visited Phoebe who also has\r\ngone public about her Aids status. According to\r\nher, the uninfected persons need to be careful in\r\norder to avoid HIV infection altogether.\r\nWhen I met her, Phoebe had been sick for two\r\ndays without drugs for lack of money. She said that,\r\nat home her neighbours and relatives give her personalised\r\nattention, unlike in hospital where care is\r\nduty-driven.\r\nAt home, care is given with compassion. She is in\r\nfull support of home-based care. Phoebe, like Jane\r\nmakes table mats and dolls for sale to earn a living.\r\nShe had not sold any because she had been in bed\r\nfor two days, nursing a headache, a backache and\r\ngases in the stomach.\r\nPatient Karanja, prefers to be at home rather\r\nthan in hospital. He said at home he could move to\r\nthe sun at will unlike in the hospital. He said he\r\nalso felt at home where he is attended to on\r\ndemand by his sister who usually is with him before\r\nhis wife returns at night.\r\nKaranja, unlike Makokha and Omenda above,\r\nhas lived to give bitter testimony of hospital care.\r\nHe told me that before he fell sick last year, his\r\nfriend died at Kenyatta hospital in September with\r\nno nurse near him.\r\n\ufffdI would not wish to be in that situation,\ufffd he\r\nsaid, adding, his being alive today is due to his\r\nrefusal to go to hospital, his caring sister and nearness\r\nto Kayole from where he gets his drugs from\r\nCatholic nuns.\r\nIn spite of problems arising from shortage of cash\r\nto give quality care to Aids patients, home-based\r\ncare givers I talked to said they are happy with\r\nhome based care because it makes families responsible\r\nfor their sick. It reduces the stigma met in hospitals\r\nand gives patients a chance to do what they\r\ncan before they succumb, thereby improving their\r\nself esteem.\r\n*Names have been changed to protect privacy\r\nThe writer is a Kenya Registered Nurse."}
