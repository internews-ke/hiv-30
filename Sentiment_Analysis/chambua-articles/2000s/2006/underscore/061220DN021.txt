{"text": "DAILY NATION\r\nWednesday December 20, 2006\r\n\r\nMedics guilty, Libyan\r\ncourt orders\r\n\r\nTRIPOLI, Tuesday\r\nA HIV CASE\r\nPalestinian doctor Ashraf Hajouj awaits the verdict from the caged\r\ndock, at the trial along with five Bulgarian nurses in Tripoli yesterday.\r\nAt right, Mr Ibrahim Mohammed al-Aurabi, 61, the father of an infected\r\nchild, shouts and gestures his approval of the verdict yesterday.\r\nLibyan court today\r\nfound five Bulgarian\r\nnurses and a Palestinian\r\ndoctor guilty of\r\ninfecting hundreds of\r\nchildren with the\r\nHIV virus that causes Aids and sentenced\r\nthem all to death.\r\nThe verdict and sentences were\r\nannounced by judge Mahmoud\r\nHaouissa. The six are accused of\r\nintentionally infecting 426 Libyan\r\nchildren with HIV at a hospital in\r\nBenghazi in the late 1990s. The\r\nprosecution had demanded the\r\ndeath penalty.\r\nMeanwhile, in Sofia, Bulgaria\r\ncondemned the death sentences\r\nagainst its nationals and the Palestinian\r\ndoctor.\r\nForeign Minister Ivailo Kalfin\r\ncalled the decision \ufffddeeply disappointing.\ufffd\r\nThe Black Sea country\ufffds\r\nparliament urged the international\r\ncommunity to reject the court\ufffds verdicts\r\nand put pressure on Libya to\r\nfree the nurses.\r\nHere is reaction by Mr\r\nGeorge Joffe, Maghreb expert, at\r\nCambridge University: \ufffdIt was\r\nabsolutely predictable on political\r\nground and had nothing to do with\r\nthe facts of the case.\ufffd\r\n\ufffdI\ufffdm not surprised. I think now\r\nthe real negotiations will begin, to\r\nfind a way either arranging compensation\r\nfor the families of the\r\ninfected children, or a pardon for\r\nthe nurses.\ufffd \ufffdThere are two reasons\r\nfor this. Number one, it gives Gaddafi\r\na much better lever to force\r\nnegotiations for compensation, and\r\nnumber two, it\ufffds a way of appeasing\r\nthe families in Benghazi.\ufffd\r\n\ufffdThere will be a price to pay. It\r\ndepends on what the international\r\ncommunity is prepared to pay. But\r\nthat\ufffds still not clear. It will be\r\nalmost certainly in the form of\r\nhumanitarian compensation.\ufffd\r\nThe medics, who deny the charges,\r\nwere convicted in a 2004 trial\r\nand sentenced to death by firing\r\nsquad. But the Libyan supreme\r\ncourt quashed the ruling last year\r\nand ordered the case be returned to\r\na lower court. (Reuters)"}
