{"text": "SATURDAY NATION\r\nDecember 2, 2006\r\n\r\nREPORT\r\nFirms \ufffdbest placed\r\nto give Aids drugs\ufffd\r\nAccess to ARVs\r\nat work must go\r\nup, says the UN\r\n\r\nGENEVA, Friday\r\nThe workplace may be\r\nthe best setting for\r\nmillions of people\r\nwith HIV and Aids to\r\nbe administered drugs\r\nthat could extend their lives,\r\nthe International Labour\r\nOrganisation (ILO) said today.\r\nIn a report published on\r\nWorld Aids Day, the United\r\nNations agency said that more\r\nthan 24 million people in the\r\nglobal workforce in 2005 suffered\r\nfrom HIV or the disease\r\nit causes, Aids.\r\nNearly 67 per cent of these\r\nlived in Africa.\r\nGiving these workers access\r\nto anti-retroviral drug therapy,\r\nor ARVs, could have lengthened\r\ntheir working lives by\r\nmore than two years, and considerably\r\nincreased per capita\r\nincomes in places such as sub-\r\nSaharan Africa, the report\r\nfound.\r\n\ufffdAccess to ARVs in the workplace\r\nmust rise substantially,\ufffd\r\nit said, estimating that 1.8 million\r\nmore African workers\r\nwould be alive in 2010 if 80 per\r\ncent of the workforce were to\r\nstart and stay on ARV therapy\r\nfrom this year.\r\nPublic health experts say\r\nthat the life-extending drugs\r\nhave transformed the oncedeadly\r\nHIV and Aids into\r\nchronic conditions. But they\r\nneed to be taken at regular\r\nintervals to be effective, and\r\ncan cause drug resistance when\r\ntaken improperly.\r\nThe ILO estimated that the\r\nHIV epidemic stripped an average\r\nof 0.5 percentage points off\r\nthe economic growth of 43\r\naffected countries every year\r\nbetween 1992 and 2004.\r\nIn sub-Saharan Africa, 31\r\ncountries lost 0.7 percentage\r\npoints of economic growth per\r\nyear during the period.\r\nEmployment growth also\r\nsuffered markedly. The ILO\r\nsaid HIV and Aids caused a 0.5\r\nper cent yearly decline in sub-\r\nSaharan Africa\ufffds annual\r\nemployment growth rate,\r\n\ufffdequivalent to an employment\r\nloss of 1.1 million (jobs) per\r\nyear for Africa.\ufffd\r\nIn China, Premier Wen Jiabao\r\ninvited 15 HIV/Aids\r\norphans and child victims to\r\ntour the ruling Communist Party\ufffds\r\nheadquarters today as a top\r\nUN official said the country\r\nneeded more education to combat\r\nthe disease\ufffds stigma.\r\nBeijing was initially slow to\r\nacknowledge the threat, but it\r\nhas stepped up the fight\r\nagainst HIV/Aids in recent\r\nyears, increasing spending on\r\nprevention programmes and\r\ni m p l e m e n t i n g a n t i -\r\ndiscrimination legislation.\r\nHowever, UN China Resident\r\nCoordinator Khalid Malik said\r\nthere was \ufffdgreat unevenness\ufffd\r\nin the supply of healthcare and\r\ntools in China in the fight\r\nagainst Aids at regional level.\r\n(Reuters)"}
