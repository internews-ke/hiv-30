{"text": "Daily Nation/ Friday, July 21, 2006\r\n\r\nGates donates\r\nSh20bn to\r\nAids research\r\n\r\nSEATTLE, Thursday\r\nMore than 20 years after\r\nscientists began searching\r\nfor an HIV vaccine,\r\nthe Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation\r\nthis week announced a\r\nmajor effort to bring together\r\nresearchers from around the\r\nworld with a collaborative new\r\nbusiness model.\r\nThe foundation announced 16\r\ngrants totalling $287 million\r\n(Sh20 billion) over five years to\r\nset up an international network\r\nof HIV vaccine scientists. A third\r\nof the money \ufffd five of the grants\r\n\ufffd will pay for central laboratories\r\nand data analysis facilities to\r\ntest researchers\ufffd findings.\r\nThe hope is to more definitively\r\nidentify the most effective vaccine\r\napproaches and then direct\r\nfuture efforts toward those ideas,\r\nsaid Dr Nicholas Hellmann,\r\nacting director\r\nof the Gates Foundation\ufffds\r\nHIV, TB and\r\nreproductive health\r\nprogramme.\r\n\ufffdUnfortunately, developing\r\nan effective HIV\r\nvaccine has proven to\r\nbe tremendously difficult,\r\nand despite the\r\ncommitted efforts of many\r\nresearchers around the world,\r\nprogress simply has not been fast\r\nenough,\ufffd\ufffd Dr Hellmann said.\r\nThe $287 million commitment is\r\nthe Gates Foundation\ufffds single\r\nlargest investment in the area of\r\nHIV-Aids research. Before this\r\nweek\ufffds announcement, the foundation\r\nhad already announced\r\nHIV-Aids grants totalling more\r\nthan $10 million (Sh730 million)\r\nin 2006. Total grants in this area\r\nin 2005 were more than $53 million\r\n(Sh3.8 billion).\r\nEach of the 165 investigators in\r\n19 countries who are getting\r\nmoney in this series of grants had\r\nto agree to share their findings in\r\nreal time and compare results\r\nwith others \ufffd even if they had\r\nbeen working on competing\r\nprojects in the past.\r\nHistorically, HIV vaccine\r\nresearch mostly has been conducted\r\nby small research\r\ngroups working independently,\r\nsaid Dr Juliana McElrath, associate\r\nhead of the infectious diseases\r\nprogram at the Fred\r\nHutchinson Cancer Research\r\nCentre in Seattle and a lead\r\nresearcher on one of the new\r\ngrants. \ufffdWhile critical progress\r\nhas been made, the HIV vaccine\r\nfield has lacked a shared,\r\nfocused strategy,\ufffd\ufffd she said.\r\nDr McElrath spoke about the\r\nlack of standardised tools to\r\ncompare results and ways to\r\nshare information quickly. She\r\nnoted that research teams usually\r\ndecide on their own\r\nwhether to pursue a particular\r\napproach and vaccine candidates\r\nfrom different researchers\r\nare not usually compared.\r\n\ufffdAs a result, there\ufffds no guarantee\r\nthat the best vaccine\r\ncandidate will be\r\nthe one that is rapidly\r\nadvanced\r\nthrough clinical trials,\ufffd\ufffd\r\nshe said.\r\nDr Hellmann said\r\nthe new level of collaboration\r\nbeing created\r\nthrough this\r\nseries of grants is\r\ncritical to making HIV vaccine\r\ndevelopment more efficient,\r\nbut he acklowledged that an\r\neffective vaccine may still be 10\r\nyears away. The collaborative\r\napproach is a new paradigm in\r\nHIV vaccine research that Dr\r\nHellmann hopes will move the\r\nprocess forward as quickly as\r\npossible.\r\nThe 11 grants going to research\r\nprojects are evenly split\r\nbetween groups seeking to find\r\nantibodies that will neutralise\r\nHIV, and those researchers trying\r\nto find a way to elicit cellular\r\nimmunity. Dr Hellmann\r\nsaid the ultimate vaccine may\r\ncombine both approaches.\r\nOver 40 million people are currently\r\nliving with HIV/Aids\r\naround the globe while 25 million\r\nhave so far died of causes\r\nrelated to the scourge.
