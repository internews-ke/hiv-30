{"text": "October 21, 2006\r\nMeet playwright Cajetan Boy\r\nHis crusading spirit refused to be confined to the world of offices and ties\r\n\r\nBy Kamau Mutunga \r\nIf you go to the Internet and\r\n\ufffdgoogle\ufffd the name Cajetan\r\nBoy, you\ufffdll get thousands of\r\nsites harping one or two\r\nthings about him. Seven\r\nyears ago, your search\r\nwould have yielded the response, \ufffdthe\r\nname does not match any documents.\ufffd\r\nNot any more for the man best\r\nknown as the script writer for the locally\r\npopular soap operas, Better Days and\r\nHeart&Soul.\r\nMeet Cajetan Boy, the resident playwright\r\nat Et Cetera Productions and\r\narguably Kenya\ufffds most prolific playwright,\r\nfilm and soap script writer.\r\nAnd at the just concluded Kenya\r\nInternational Film Festival (KIFF) held\r\nat the Alliance Francaise Auditorium,\r\nlocal film lovers got a preview of his latest\r\nefforts for the silver screen.\r\nRoho and Deadly Ties, a 40-minute\r\npreview of a 30-part television soap\r\nopera were screened to a full house. He\r\nalso acted in Vincent Mbaya\ufffds film,\r\nEmancipation, also shown at the Alliance\r\nFrancaise, besides the 2004 film\r\nadaptation of his play, By Any Means\r\nNecessary, in which Helen Keli scooped\r\nthe Best Actress\ufffd\r\nAward for her role\r\nas Jezebel.\r\nIt has also been\r\nnominated for exhibition\r\nat the forthcoming\r\nLos Angeles\r\nFilm Festival.\r\nGetting into film\r\nwas a deviation\r\nfrom his earlier\r\ncalling for which he\r\nis known\ufffd the\r\nstage \ufffd for which\r\nhe has written six\r\nfull-length plays\r\nstarting with Benta\r\nin 1999, followed\r\nby All Girls\r\nTogether; Family\r\nTies; By Any Means Necessary; Backlash\r\nand DeadTalk, which made its\r\ndebut at the Phoenix Players in April\r\nthis year.\r\nBenta is the perennial favourite. It\r\nhas been translated and performed in\r\nDholuo and Kikuyu as Mos, Benta, Mos\r\nand Kahora, Benta respectively. Giles\r\nMigan, a visiting American teacher, was\r\nso enthralled after watching it that she\r\nhad it published by Jacaranda Designs\r\nfor use by her students back home.\r\nFamily Ties, on the other hand, was\r\nadapted as a television drama series and\r\nserialised by a local television station\r\ntwo years ago, while Backlash is in the\r\nfilm editing stages at Sisimka studios.\r\nWe were recounting all these developments\r\nin his life on this humid Thursday\r\nafternoon at the Professional Centre\r\npub, whose basement houses The\r\nPhoenix Players\ufffd, Kenya\ufffds only repertory\r\ntheatre, where Cajetan or \ufffdCaje\ufffd\r\nto his pals, is directing Eva Moberg\ufffds\r\nsubtle comedy, Forever Young.\r\nI survey his clean shaven dome, bushy\r\nbeard, two earrings on his left ear,\r\nbeaded bracelets in national colours,\r\nnumerous silver rings, faded jeans...Caje\r\ncuts the profile of your typical Kenyan\r\nthespian \ufffd informal, artistically expressive.\r\nHimself.\r\nHe stares at me with his glassy eyes,\r\nwhich transports me into a time capsule\r\nback to 1994 or thereabouts. The place\r\nwas Fort Jesus estate in Kibera inside a\r\nsingle Spartan room. There was only a\r\nmattress. And in, shuffled a tall marvinclad\r\nman in faded jeans and sneakers.\r\nHe was a student at the University, I\r\nwas told.\r\n\ufffdMeet Dick\ufffd David Mwangi, my\r\nformer schoolmate whom I had gone to\r\nvisit, said by way of introduction. I was\r\nto see Dick again in 1996 at the defunct\r\nMiujiza Players\ufffd Theatre. He was acting\r\nas Bin Broker in Meja Mwangi\ufffds The\r\nPlague, alongside Caroline Odongo, a\r\nrespectable theatre director whom he\r\nlater married.\r\nAnd I made a mental note to ask\r\n\ufffdDick\ufffd when, how and why he became\r\n\ufffdCajetan Boy\ufffd.\r\n\ufffdThat year was my turning point. I\r\nhad seen a press advert seeking performing\r\nartistes to act in scripts for USAidsponsored\r\nHIV/Aids awareness campaigns\r\nat the Miujiza Players. And I was\r\npicked. But the project required six\r\nplays and the submitted ones didn\ufffdt\r\nmeet the required criteria.\ufffd\r\nCajetan plunged head-on into script\r\nwriting with Dilemma, Leon, Why? and\r\nVictim, which were performed all over\r\nthe country. Thereafter, he became\r\ntotally immersed in theatre.\r\nHis fertile imagination and prolific\r\npen saw him write Marital Affairs,\r\nWorking woman, Food for Thought and\r\nCuts of Brutality, which were all taken\r\nup by NGO advocacy groups.\r\nThe then doyen of Kenyan theatre,\r\nJames Falkland approached him. He told\r\nhim to duplicate the success he had with\r\nOne Act plays with a simple, but full\r\nlength play and Benta \ufffd a moving portrayal\r\nof the injustices perpetrated by\r\nclass systems\ufffd premiered to full houses\r\nin 1999.\r\n\ufffdPeople thought Falkland was mad to\r\nhave a Kenyan play staged at the upmarket\r\nPhoenix Players\ufffd. But he went\r\nfurther and encouraged me to pen a\r\nlighter play with a single set and few\r\nactors and All Girls Together was the\r\nresult. In 2001, the play was adapted and\r\nserialised by a local TV station.\ufffd\r\nThemes in his plays revolve around\r\nrelationships, crime, poverty and poor\r\ngovernance. \ufffdMy plays subconsciously\r\nreflect what is going on in our society,\ufffd\r\nsays Cajetan whose muse is not inspired\r\nby other playwrights.\r\nActually, he prefers reading science\r\nfiction, elements of which can be discerned\r\nfrom DeadTalk, a play that\r\nrevolves around the question: what\r\nwould a dead person do, given a second\r\nchance at life?\r\nThe action took place in a city mortuary\r\nwhere two undertakers, Paco and\r\nNoah, were attending to the bodies of\r\nMiles, who had died of HIV complications;\r\nBaraka, a thug who was shot 12\r\ntimes; Nayla who died while procuring an\r\nabortion after being raped and Lucilla, a\r\nhappy-go-lucky woman who was run\r\nover by a philandering hubby.\r\nBut quarter-way through the play,\r\nsimilar questions are posed by in a \ufffddialogue\r\nof the dead\ufffd when the deceased\r\nwake up as spirits, providing insights\r\ninto their lives before they died while\r\nquestioning the meaning of life at the\r\nsame time.\r\nTreachery, loneliness, carelessness,\r\ncrime, ambition and human superficiality\r\nare some of the themes explored in\r\nthis play whose germ-seed was an idea\r\nfrom Nicholas Ombewa.\r\nHow does he prod the muse for such\r\nplays?\r\n\ufffdI can think about a play\ufffds storyline\r\nfor three months, but I take three weeks\r\nto put it together. I wrote Episode Two\r\nof Deadly Ties in two days. I don\ufffdt experience\r\nwriters\ufffds block as I work on multiple\r\nscripts. If I get stuck on one, I jump\r\nto the other. I save my ideas as SMSes\r\non my cellphone so that I don\ufffdt forget\r\nthem,\ufffd says Cajetan, who has acted in\r\nover 30 productions among them A Man\r\nfor all Seasons, Taming of the Shrew and\r\nthe Good woman of Setswan, his most\r\nmemorable play where he acted as\r\nWang, the water seller.\r\nBut the last time we watched him on\r\nstage was in December 2005 at the\r\nPhoenix Players when he acted as Shaka\r\nZulu in John Githongo\ufffds debut\r\neffort,Shaka Zulu is Coming to Dinner.\r\nWe are at Club Soundd on this Tues-\r\nMeet playwright Cajetan Boy\r\n\ufffdCaje\ufffd cuts\r\nthe profile\r\nof your typical\r\nKenyan\r\nthespian \ufffd\r\ninformal,\r\nartistically\r\nexpressive.\r\nHimself\r\nCajetan Boy: \ufffdI work on multiple scripts. INSET: Playing a gangster for\r\nhire in the movie \ufffdBy Any means Necessary\ufffd.\r\nCONTINUED ON PAGE 20"}
