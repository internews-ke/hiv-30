{"text": "Daily Nation/ Thursday, May 25, 2006\r\n\r\nGive the Vulnerable a Life Free of Violence and Fear\r\n\r\nGender-based violence, or violence\r\nagainst women, is a major public\r\nhealth and human rights problem\r\nthroughout the world. This is not an\r\nAfrican phenomenon. It is a global\r\npandemic. Men and women must work\r\ntogether to end this scourge.\r\nGlobally, one in three women will be\r\nraped, beaten, coerced into sex or otherwise\r\nabused in her lifetime. Violence against\r\nwomen has profound implications for health\r\nbut is often ignored. The World Health\r\nOrganisation warns that \ufffdone of the most\r\ncommon forms of violence against women is\r\nthat performed by a husband or male\r\npartner.\ufffd This violence is frequently invisible\r\nsince it happens behind closed doors. Often,\r\nlegal systems and cultural norms do not treat\r\nit as a crime, but rather as a \ufffdprivate\ufffd family\r\nmatter, or a normal part of life. But let\ufffds be\r\nclear: women who are forced to have sex by\r\ntheir husbands are brutalised and lose\r\nrespect for that man.\r\nRegrettably, sexual violence is\r\nincreasingly prevalent in Kenya. One woman\r\nis raped every 30 minutes. A chilling statistic. But it is not just\r\nwomen that are affected. The Nairobi Women\ufffds Hospital has\r\ntreated over 100 men in the last three years. More people are\r\nvictims of such abuse but may be too scared by the stigma\r\nattached to the crime to tell their families, let\r\nalone report their attacks to the relevant\r\nauthorities. Society must be more\r\nunderstanding, and encourage victims to seek\r\nmedical help quickly so that anti-retrovirals can\r\nprevent HIV transmission most effectively.\r\nAlmost daily in the local media there are\r\nreports of children, men and women being\r\nsubjected to barbaric acts of violence. In a\r\ndisturbing new trend, there has been an\r\nincrease in incidents where men target minors\r\nfor sex in the belief that it will make them\r\nimmune from contracting HIV. Some men,\r\nalready infected with HIV/Aids, reportedly rape\r\nyoung girls believing that sex with a virgin will\r\ncure them. This is a medical nonsense and a\r\nmoral outrage.\r\nProtecting vulnerable Kenyans from sexual\r\nviolence will involve action on several fronts.\r\nTraining for police, judges and health workers\r\nso that there is a national network who\r\nunderstand how to tell the signs and help and\r\nprotect those who are suffering. This would\r\nbuild on the important initiative of the Kenya\r\nPolice at Kilimani. It means men discussing\r\ntogether the hazards that their loved ones face \ufffd seeking to\r\nunderstand their viewpoint \ufffd and resolving how communities can\r\nprotect women and children better. And it needs better laws.\r\nThe current legislative framework was enacted in 1930 and is\r\nwholly inadequate and inconsistent with modern society. The\r\nexisting laws do not provide for crimes such as sexual abuse of\r\nmen and boys, the intentional transmission of HIV/Aids, or\r\npaedophilia. The Sexual Offences Bill proposes to address this by\r\nreforming the law and enforcing harsher punishments for sex\r\noffenders.\r\nWe welcome the ongoing debate on this issue. It is the proper\r\nrole of Parliament to debate, draft legislation and agree on\r\namendments. But I agree strongly with a point emphasised by so\r\nmany who have contributed to the debate on second reading \ufffd\r\nthis opportunity to put right the shortcomings of existing laws must\r\nnot be missed.\r\nI look forward to the passing of a Bill that carries widespread\r\nsupport. But the original draft must not be watered down to the\r\npoint that it no longer protects vulnerable Kenyans adequately.\r\nFor instance, I read with great concern reports that an amendment\r\nis proposed to Clause 11\ufffd Indecent Act with a Child \ufffd reducing\r\nthe minimum sentence to a Sh.50,000 fine. Surely the very\r\nessence of this Bill is to protect children from such barbaric acts?\r\nTo quote Nelson Mandela \ufffdSafety and Security don\ufffdt just\r\nhappen, they are the result of collective consensus and public\r\ninvestment. We owe our children, the most vulnerable citizens in\r\nour society, a life free of violence and fear.\ufffd\r\nWe know that the legislative framework is not enough on its\r\nown. But it\ufffds an essential starting point. It will give the women of\r\nKenya a legal forum in which their voice can be heard.\r\n\ufffd H.E. Adam Wood,\r\nBritish High Commissioner to Kenya"}
