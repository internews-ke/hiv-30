{"text": "Monday, December 4, 2006\r\n\r\nHospital struggles with\r\ndeadly new TB strain\r\n\r\nBy SARAH MCGREGOR\r\nTUGELA FERRY (South Africa)\r\nn a country where Aids kills 900\r\npeople each day, full hospitals\r\nand beleaguered doctors are\r\nnothing new.\r\nBut at one hospital in rural\r\nKwaZulu-Natal province, what\r\ncould be a new public health nightmare\r\nis taking its toll as doctors and nurses\r\ngrapple with a new, highly drugresistant\r\nform of tuberculosis.\r\nAt least 74 people, including staff, at\r\nthe Church of Scotland Hospital in\r\nTugela Ferry have died since January\r\n2005 after catching the drug-resistant\r\nstrain. Most were HIV-positive and their\r\nimmune systems were already weakened.\r\nThe new strain is resistant to most if\r\nnot all of the lines of defence against the\r\nhighly infectious lung disease spread\r\nthrough coughing and sneezing. Left\r\nuntreated, TB attacks the lungs and can\r\ntravel to other organs, the brain and\r\nbones.\r\nLast week, South Africa\ufffds health\r\ndepartment said 263 cases of extremely\r\ndrug-resistant TB, or XDR-TB, had been\r\nrecorded in KwaZulu-Natal, with about\r\n30 new cases being reported each\r\nmonth. Another 40 cases have been\r\nrecorded in other regions.\r\nXDR-TB is particularly deadly for\r\nthose whose immune systems have\r\nalready been weakened by HIV/Aids \ufffd\r\nterrible news in KwaZulu-Natal where\r\nalmost 40 per cent of the adult population\r\nis believed to be infected with the\r\nvirus.\r\n\ufffdEverything changed in 1990 with\r\nAids. We had TB under control then,\r\nmaybe 100 patients. Now we have 800,\ufffd\r\nsaid the Christian-run hospital\ufffds chief\r\nmedical officer Theo Van Der Merwe.\r\n\ufffdWith XDR-TB more people are dying.\r\nIt\ufffds depressing because we can work\r\nlonger hours but I don\ufffdt see it slowing\r\ndown.\ufffd\r\nThe World Health Organisation said\r\nlast month the new strain could become\r\na major killer in Aids-hit parts of Africa\r\nwhere governments have been slow to\r\nroll out TB control programmes.\r\nExperts say the best way to fight Aids\r\nand TB in Africa is to overlap strategies.\r\nBut no new antibiotics have been\r\ndeveloped for TB in 40 years and it will\r\nbe at least 2020 before new treatments\r\nare widely available.\r\nPoverty and lack of resources complicate\r\nthe problem.\r\nIn KwaZulu-Natal, the well-kept\r\nmodern Church of Scotland hospital is\r\na stone\ufffds throw from dilapidated shacks\r\nwhere running water and reliable electricity\r\nare luxuries and bucket toilets\r\nare standard.\r\nThe poor residents settled in the lush\r\nhills nearby are a target for acute diseases.\r\nAbout 1.3 million of KwaZulu-\r\nNatal\ufffds 9.2 million people are HIVpositive.\r\nThe hospital waiting-room is packed\r\nwith patients who eke out a living as\r\nsubsistence farmers or sell small items\r\nlike single cigarettes or fresh produce\r\nat roadside stalls.\r\nInside the TB ward, the windows are\r\nwide open \ufffd fresh air makes it hard for\r\nTB germs to stay alive \ufffd but the breeze\r\noffers little comfort to the bedridden\r\nand fatigued.\r\nDozens are kept in crowded rooms.\r\nThere are no vacancies and a waiting\r\nlist of around 50. Staff strap on surgical\r\nmasks and patients cough into cloths to\r\nprevent spreading the illness.\r\nDoctors and nurses are on call day and\r\nnight, stretched to breaking-point because\r\nthe hospital is short 20 medical staff and\r\nefforts to recruit are hampered by a lack\r\nof specialists.\r\n\ufffdMy neighbour stopped coming over to\r\nvisit. Finally she yelled (across the yard)\r\nthat she no longer wanted to sit with me\r\nbecause I work with XDRs,\ufffd said Thobeka\r\nMajola, 24, a nurse at the hospital. \ufffdI\ufffdm\r\nscared too.\ufffd\r\nIn many ways, life has changed remarkably\r\nlittle on the streets of Tugela Ferry\r\ndespite the arrival of the deadly TB strain.\r\nFriends greet each other with outstretched\r\nhands, huddle to chat and stroll\r\narm-in-arm on the town\ufffds rutted roads.\r\nBut there are fears the disease might\r\nnot be fully understood in an area which\r\nhas lost many of its educated residents to\r\nurban centres. \ufffdI am not 100 per cent sure\r\nbut I\ufffdve heard that you can die from it,\ufffd\r\nsaid Jaheni Majolo, 36, who tested positive\r\nfor the deadly strain and is being\r\ntreated. The mother-of-five, a widow, said\r\nshe expects to survive. Elena Jordaan, the\r\nhospital\ufffds chief nurse, said she cranks up\r\nthe volume in the TB ward when Zululanguage\r\ntelevision programmes talk\r\nabout XDR-TB in an attempt to teach sufferers.\r\n(Reuters)"}
