{"text": "Daily Nation / Tuesday, August 15 , 2006\r\n\r\nLong distance\r\ndrivers raving\r\nover job terms\r\n\r\nBy PETER NGARE\r\nThe job is lonely, and the\r\nharsh working conditions\r\ndrive them mad \ufffd and into\r\ncheap sex.\r\nTake Joe for example, the\r\nseasoned long-distance truck driver with\r\nmore than 10 years of experience. The\r\n39-year-old driver is a bitter man. He\r\nattributes the break up of his family five\r\nyears ago to \ufffdunfriendly working\r\nconditions\ufffd.\r\nHe also confesses that he is living with\r\nHIV, which he says he could not have\r\ncontracted, were it not for the kind of\r\nwork he does.\r\nJoe\ufffds story is replicated over and over\r\nby other drivers. Theirs are stories of\r\nKenyans caught between a rock and a\r\nhard place. They spend their lives on\r\nhighways with plenty of cheap sex, meagre\r\npay, and lack of job security.\r\nThe International\r\nTransport Federation\r\nlast year classified Kenyan\r\ntruck drivers as the\r\nmost abused in the\r\nworld, due to the harsh\r\nworking conditions and\r\npoor pay.\r\nMr Nicholas Mbugua,\r\nthe chairman of the\r\nLong Distance Truck\r\nDrivers Welfare Association,\r\nlaments the poor\r\nstate of affairs bedevilling\r\nthe drivers.\r\nOne thing the drivers\r\nhave to put up with is\r\ndriving long distances\r\nwithout breaks.\r\nSix-day journey According to Mr Abdi Mohammed\r\nwho plies between Mombasa\r\nand Kampala, a journey to\r\nand from coastal town takes about six\r\ndays.\r\n\ufffdAfter setting off from Mombasa in\r\nthe morning, I drive for 10 hours to\r\nMlolongo weighbridge, where I put up\r\novernight,\ufffd says Mohammed.\r\nAccording to Alfred, some drivers\r\nhave to spend the night in the driver\ufffds\r\ncabin. \ufffdI\ufffdm paid Sh3,500 as safari\r\nallowance. The money is not enough for\r\nfood and lodging. So I sleep in the cabin,\ufffd\r\nsays Alfred.\r\nMr Mohammed says that after Mlolongo,\r\nthe journey to Malaba border\r\npoint kicks off early the following morning.\r\nHe arrives there in the evening,\r\nthen spends the night awaiting the final\r\nstretch to Kampala.\r\nAt Kampala, the drivers can spend a\r\nday or two as the cargo is off-loaded and\r\nthen start the return journey to\r\nMombasa.\r\nArrive in Mombasa Mr Mohammed says that on arriving\r\nin Mombasa, most drivers\r\nare not given a chance to see\r\ntheir families, and are instead ordered\r\nto drive to the go-downs for loading. \ufffdI\r\njust take a nap on the cabin and wait to\r\nstart the journey to Kampala again,\ufffd he\r\nsays.\r\n\ufffdIf you report\r\nthat the lorry has\r\nmechanical problems,\r\nyou are told\r\nto load first and\r\nthen drive to Mariakani,\r\nwhere\r\nmechanics look\r\ninto it. This denies\r\nt h e d r i v e r a\r\nchance to go\r\nhome for a rest\r\nand to be with the\r\nf a m i l y , \ufffd s a y s\r\nMohammed.\r\nAccording to\r\nMr Mbugua, most\r\ntransport companies\r\npay their\r\ndrivers between\r\nS h 3 , 0 0 0 a n d\r\nSh4,000 as safari allowance. This, he\r\nsays, is far below the recommended\r\nSh20,000 for a journey from Mombasa\r\nto Kampala.\r\nHe said some drivers are forced to sit\r\nbehind the steering wheel for more than\r\n20 hours at a time. This is usually out of\r\nthe need to be at a particular point on\r\ntime to escape sacking and abusive\r\nlanguage.\r\nAccording to Transport Licensing\r\nBoard chairman Hassan ole Kamwaro,\r\nwhat is happening is in contravention of\r\nlaw. Mr Kamwaro says all drivers are\r\nsupposed to rest after every eight hours\r\non the road. But he says this is being\r\nflouted by employers.\r\nWorse still for the drivers, companies\r\nare now laying off loaders, who are\r\nimportant companions to drivers. Mr\r\nMbugua said a number of companies\r\nhad adopted a policy where drivers\r\nmake the long distance alone.\r\n\ufffdIf you have a tyre burst, it is a nightmare\r\nchanging it. We are being exposed\r\nto attacks by robbers on the way,\ufffd said\r\none driver.\r\nThe drivers have also to contend with\r\nthe fact that they have no job security.\r\nMr Mbugua said on employment, the\r\ndrivers do not enter into any written\r\nagreement with the employer.\r\nMr Kamwaro terms this illegal, for all\r\ndrivers of commercial vehicles are supposed\r\nto be employed on permanent\r\nbasis.\r\nMr Mbugua said the salaries of most\r\ndrivers ranged between Sh8,000 and\r\nSh12,000. He said this compared poorly\r\nwith drivers working for companies in\r\nUganda. \ufffdDrivers for Ugandan lorries\r\nget an equivalent of Sh30,000,\ufffd he said.\r\nMost drivers interviewed disclosed\r\nthat they were forced to drive overloaded\r\nlorries. They said the lorries are\r\ninterfered with to make room for more\r\ncargo. \ufffdIt\ufffds a daunting task to control an\r\noverloaded lorry. If you complain or\r\nrefuse to start the journey, you are\r\nsacked,\ufffd said one driver.\r\nAn overloaded lorry stands high\r\nchances of experiencing tyre bursts.\r\n\ufffdThe truck owners overload the lorries\r\nand in case you have a tyre burst or are\r\ninvolved in accident, your salary is\r\ndeducted,\ufffd said Mr Mbugua.\r\nWhen working as a long distance driver,\r\nyou never know whether you will be\r\nin employment the next minute. \ufffdDrivers\r\nare sacked through mobile phones.\r\nThe employer just calls to ask where you\r\nare, and he tells you to park on the side\r\nof the road and hand over to another\r\ndriver,\ufffd said Mr Mohammed.\r\nAccording to Mr Mbugua the harsh\r\nworking conditions facing the drivers\r\nhave put them in the category of high\r\nrisk groups when it comes to Aids. Failure\r\nto give the drivers a break after the\r\ntrip to be with their families exposes\r\nthem to the lure of sex along the way.\r\nProstitutes position Prostitutes usually position themselves\r\nat strategic points, with\r\ntheir favourite spots being Mariakani,\r\nMlolongo, Machakos Junction,\r\nSalgaa and Malaba. Drivers said the\r\nconditions they are exposed to has led to\r\nthe break-up of a number of families.\r\nThey blame the Government for failing\r\nto register a trade union that would\r\nchampion their rights.\r\n\ufffdSince 1996, we have been agitating\r\nfor a union, but the Government is yet\r\nto register it,\ufffd said Mr Mbugua.\r\nHe claimed that the registration of the\r\nunion was being frustrated by lorry owners\r\nwho, he said, had compromised senior\r\ngovernment officials."}
