{"text": "DAILY NATION\r\nThursday, December 7, 2006\r\n\r\nNew scientific\r\nevidence in Libyan\r\nHIV case\r\n\r\nLONDON, Wednesday\r\nScientists have produced new\r\nevidence that casts doubts on\r\ncharges against five Bulgarian\r\nnurses and a Palestinian\r\ndoctor accused of deliberately\r\ninfecting 426 Libyan children\r\nwith HIV in 1998.\r\nThe trial of the six health\r\nworkers ended in Tripoli last\r\nmonth. The prosecutor\r\ndemanded the death penalty\r\nafter five Libyan HIV/Aids\r\nexperts stood by their 61-page\r\nreport written in 2003 that\r\nfound the infections resulted\r\nfrom an intentional act.\r\nA Libyan court is expected\r\nto deliver a verdict on\r\nDecember 19.\r\nBut a team of international\r\nscientists who reconstructed\r\nthe history of the virus from\r\nsamples from the children\r\nhave shown the subtype of\r\nHIV began infecting patients\r\nat the Al-Fateh Hospital in\r\nBenghazi before the foreign\r\nmedical team arrived.\r\n\ufffdThe evidence shows the\r\nchain of infection started a\r\nfew years before the arrival\r\nof the foreign staff accused\r\nof causing it deliberately,\ufffd\r\nDr Tulio de Oliveira, a\r\nmolecular virologist at\r\nOxford University in England,\r\nsaid in an interview.\r\nThe scientists, whose\r\nfindings are published\r\nonline by the journal\r\nNature, analysed the genetic\r\ncode of HIV and Hepatitis C\r\nviruses from the children to\r\ndetermine when the outbreaks\r\nstarted. They did an\r\nextensive analysis using 20\r\ndifferent models.\r\n\ufffdAll of them give a date\r\nfor the start of the epidemic\r\naround the mid-1990s,\ufffd said\r\nDe Oliveira.\r\nHe added that a team of\r\n10 specialists from around\r\nthe world who reviewed the\r\nresearch think the results\r\nare \ufffdextremely solid.\ufffd\r\nThe six medical workers,\r\nwho have protested their\r\ninnocence and said their\r\nconfessions had been made\r\nunder torture, arrived in\r\nLibya in March 1998. They\r\nhave been in detention since\r\n1999. (Reuters)"}
