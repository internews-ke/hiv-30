{"text": "Daily Nation/ Friday, April 21, 2006\r\nSpirited campaign to stop human rights abuses in industry takes root\r\n\r\nBy JOHN OYWA\r\nAwoman is putting the finishing\r\ntouches to a bulky\r\ntraining manual she has\r\nbeen preparing for a month\r\nin a small office at Tom\r\nMboya estate in Kisumu.\r\nThis week, she is handling three topics:\r\n\ufffdHuman Rights for Women in the Fishing\r\nIndustry\ufffd, \ufffdSex-For-Fish and Aids\ufffd\r\nand \ufffdMicro Finance Management for\r\nWomen Fish Traders\ufffd.\r\nLying on the far end of her desk is a\r\nFood and Agriculture Organisation 1998\r\nreport titled: \ufffdWomen Feed the\r\nWorld\ufffd, with a kicker to the effect that\r\nmore than half of the world\ufffds food is\r\nproduced by women.\r\nMeet Ms Jennipher Kere, the woman\r\nwho left a plum job in the Ministry of\r\nEducation to champion the rights of\r\nwomen fish traders.\r\nFor five years, Ms Kere has been spearheading\r\na campaign to end what she\r\nterms gender discrimination and human\r\nrights abuses in the fishing industry.\r\nFishing project\r\nAn organisation she helped found in\r\n2002 \ufffd Women in the Fishing Industry\r\nProject (Wifip) \ufffd has produced radio\r\nprogrammes and distributed training\r\nmanuals to women in all the major\r\nbeaches of Lake Victoria.\r\nWifip, Ms Kere says, has helped form 15\r\nwomen\ufffds groups in Nyando, Kisumu,\r\nBondo and Busia districts to sensitise\r\nwomen on their rights, Aids, and fish\r\nmarketing.\r\n\ufffdI started the organisation because I\r\nknew women needed information and\r\nempowerment if they were to survive in\r\nthe male-dominated fishing industry\ufffd,\r\nshe told the Nation.\r\nShe says sex-for-fish is traumatising, and\r\nblames it on ignorance and poverty ravaging\r\nmany communities in the Lake\r\nBasin.\r\n\ufffdIt is a complex phenomenon. The\r\nwomen are not being forced into sex.\r\nThere are conditional factors that force\r\nthem to sleep with men,\ufffd says Ms Kere.\r\nShe adds: \ufffdThere\ufffds a group of women\r\nthat is just ignorant. The women don\ufffdt\r\nknow the dangers\r\ninvolved in reckless\r\nsex. Some do it out\r\nof desperation \ufffd to\r\nsurvive. These\r\ninclude widows who\r\nhave children to\r\nfeed.\ufffd\r\nMany of the woman\r\ntrapped in the sex-for-fish business are\r\nnot from the fishing communities and\r\nmight have run away from their matrimonial\r\nhomes after divorcing or losing\r\ntheir husbands.\r\nSome are on the beaches to escape traditional\r\ncustoms like wife inheritance.\r\nThe women in the fishing industry are\r\nmainly involved in post-harvest activities\r\nlike fish smoking, drying and marketing.\r\nMrs Kere says women flock the beaches\r\nbecause fish trade is easy to start. One\r\nneeds only about Sh500 to start trading\r\nin fresh or dried fish. Others start it\r\nwithout a single cent \ufffd on credit.\r\nDevelopment agencies\r\nShe says the islands where most of the\r\nvulnerable women live have been\r\nneglected by the Government and other\r\ndevelopment agencies.\r\nThese islands, like Ringiti, Remba,\r\nMigingo and others have no health centres,\r\nand fishermen and women fish\r\ntraders are being decimated by Aids.\r\n\ufffdI once shed tears when I visited Ringiti\r\nIsland. The level of immorality and\r\nignorance was shocking. HIV-related\r\ndeaths were horrifying,\ufffd says Ms Kere.\r\nShe adds: \ufffdThe people living on the\r\nislands are in dire need of voluntary\r\ncounselling and testing centres (VCTs).\r\nThey also need anti-retroviral drugs and\r\neducation on how to live positively with\r\nthe virus.\ufffd\r\nThere is also need to advise the fishing\r\ncommunities to change their eating habits\r\nas a way of guarding against opportunistic\r\ndiseases brought by HIV. Fish is\r\nthe main source of food on the beaches.\r\nMs Kere says women fall prey to sex\r\npests on the beaches because they have\r\nnever known their rights. They never\r\nnegotiate, even for things they have a\r\nright to get.\r\nTo overcome these problems Ms Kere\r\nwants the Government and its development\r\npartners to start elaborate health\r\nand human rights campaigns on the\r\nbeaches.\r\n\ufffdThere is an urgent need to empower\r\nthe women through education and financial\r\nassistance to enable them to start\r\nbusinesses. They should be encouraged\r\nto form groups and buy boats, if possible,\ufffd\r\nshe says.\r\nEmpowerment, she explains, is not just\r\nabout giving the women money to start\r\nbusiness, but a wholesome approach that\r\nincludes educating women on their\r\nrights and good business management.\r\n\ufffdStaff at Wifip tried an integrated\r\napproach in addressing women issues on\r\nsatellite beaches in four districts and it\r\nworked. Women targeted have\r\nimproved their businesses, and no longer\r\ndepend on free fish\ufffd, she says.\r\nMs Kere\ufffds organisation has been giving\r\nloans to women through a micro-finance\r\nrevolving fund. This has enabled them to\r\ndiversify into other income-generating\r\nprojects.\r\nA research commissioned by Wifip in\r\nAugust 2002 indicates that about 44 per\r\ncent of women in the fishing industry fall\r\nbetween the ages of 25 to 39. About 19\r\nper cent are aged 40 and above, while\r\nthe rest are aged below 25.\r\nStandard Eight\r\nAbout 48 per cent of women involved in\r\nfish trade on the beaches have been to\r\nschool up to Standard Eight. Only One\r\nout of 229 have college\r\neducation,\r\nwhile 29 per cent\r\nhave secondary\r\neducation.\r\nTwenty-one per\r\ncent of the women\r\nare widows, two per\r\ncent are separated\r\nfrom their husbands while 26 per cent\r\nare in polygamous unions.\r\nThe report says that about 63 per cent of\r\nwomen trading in fish save their earnings\r\nthrough \ufffdmerry-go-rounds\ufffd.\r\nFifteen per cent save in form of animals,\r\nwhile only six per cent save in banks.\r\nThere are no banks on the beaches, and\r\nfish traders have to travel long distances\r\nto Migori, Kisumu, Homa Bay, Bondo,\r\nSiaya or Busia to acess banking.\r\nSome women, about 1.3 per cent according\r\nto the research, leave their money\r\nwith shopkeepers.\r\nAbout 33 per cent save between Sh51 to\r\nSh100 per week.\r\nThe report indicates that while most\r\nwomen (51.8 per cent) use family contributions\r\nto start fish businesses, some\r\neight per cent get credit from fishermen."}
