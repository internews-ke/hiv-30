{"text": "Thursday, March 23, 2006\r\nStalking the Aids virus in Samburu\r\n\r\nBy Arthur Okwemba\r\nWith only a bag, a file and a pair of\r\nstrong legs, Daniel Ebongon\r\ntraverses the width and breath of\r\nSamburu District hunting for the\r\nAids virus.\r\nEbongon, known locally as the \ufffdHunter\ufffd has\r\nsince December tested 231 people for HIV, giving\r\na full new meaning to mobile VCT.\r\nToday, when we caught up with him, the Hunter,\r\nhad just walked over 25 kilometres to Lolkuniani\r\nin Wamba division, where several Samburu\r\nherdsmen and women had converged for the\r\nmarket day.\r\n\ufffdThis is one day I never miss, it offers a unique\r\nchance to meet a big group of people and possible\r\nclients,\ufffd says Ebongon, who works for the Nomadic\r\nCommunity Trust.\r\nAs the people go about trading, the Hunter moves\r\namongst them talking about the importance of\r\nknowing their HIV status. Some who have not\r\nheard of the virus are suspicious of his activities and\r\nrarely warm up to his messages.\r\nOn the other hand, those who agree to be tested\r\nare moved a few metres from the crowd where he\r\ncounsels them, before carrying out the test. Within\r\n30 minutes, the clients get their results.\r\nSome who are willing but too busy trading have to\r\nbe waited for, sometimes for as long as six hours\r\nwhen they are through with business. But yet others\r\nwho are too busy have to be booked for the next\r\nmarket day. Even with all this difficulties, Ebongon\r\nis able to test three to four clients on every\r\nmarket day.\r\nDuring other days, he moves to various homesteads\r\neducating the pastoralists about HIV and\r\ntesting any who are willing. Although it has been\r\ndifficult to cover a larger area, Ebongon will not\r\nbe the only one walking around this area in the\r\ncoming months.\r\nRecently, the United Nations Population Fund,\r\nwhich has been funding activities on the prevention\r\nof HIV/Aids in the district, has trained people\r\nwho will, among things, carry out mobile VCT\r\nCONTINUED ON PAGE 28"}
