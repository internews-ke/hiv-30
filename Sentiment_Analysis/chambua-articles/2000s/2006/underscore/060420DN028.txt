{"text": "Daily Nation/ Thursday, April 20, 2006\r\n\r\nHIV POSITIVE BOY HACKED TO DEATH\r\nWe People Living With HIV/AIDS (PLWHAS) and the rest of the stakeholders wish to make public express\r\nour grievances and devastation on the death of 15yr old Isaiah Gakuyo, who, on the morning of Wednesday\r\n12th April 2006 was murdered by his guardian uncle. This was beastiality of the highest order. It is\r\nregrettable and most unfortunate that 20 years down the line of intensive HIV/AIDS intervention activities in\r\nour dear country, stigma and discrimination still stands defiantly as an epidemic on its own. The\r\nunacceptable murder of Isaiah could be the tip of an iceberg for children orphaned by AIDS who have either\r\nsuffered or died painfully and silently under the untold torture by their families and communities.\r\nThe hacking to death of Isaiah Gakugo leaves a painful, unforgettable and deplorable landmark in our hearts\r\nwhich signifies how stigma and discrimination is embedded in our society.\r\nThe deafening silence of our leaders and relevant authorities on this matter remains a a great concern. None\r\nhas come out openly to condemn this act. No wonder the weak law enforcement and police inaction still\r\nforms the basis of ignoring pertinent issues in Kenya, when it comes to cases related to HIV/AIDS.\r\nDespite a recommendable progress in addressing HIV/AIDS pandemic and the positive results we have\r\nregistered, such shameful acts of stigma and discrimination poses the greatest potential to diminish the gains\r\nalready made.\r\nWe propose the following Actions to be undertaken:\r\nImmediate action: We call on the government of Kenya, through the Police, Ministry of Home Affairs,\r\nChildren\ufffds Department, headed by VP, H. E Moody Awori to immediately arrest and charge the boy\ufffds Isaiah\ufffds\r\nmurderer.\r\nIn this regard, we give the government 14 days to act, after which we shall file a court case against the state\r\nfor failing to protect Isaiah.\r\nLong term action; we call on the government and all stakeholders to draw up a clear strategy for addressing\r\nthe needs of orphans and vulnerable children in such areas as security, care and social welfare.\r\nWe also call on all human rights activists, those concerned and interested in children\ufffds rights and people\r\nliving with HIV/AIDS to come out very loud and clear and condemn this barbaric act. We would like to see\r\njustice administered and the rights of Orphans and Vulnerable Children\ufffds addressed, as outlined in the\r\nconvention of rights of the child to which African countries are signatories.\r\nWe call on all religious leaders and churches predominantly to be in the forefront, and come out strongly in\r\ncondemning and destigmatizing HIV/AIDS in our society.\r\nFinally, we call on all Kenyans to show solidarity in mourning the cruel death of Isaiah Gakuyo, and join us\r\nin a peaceful demonstration against this violation of human rights, on Thursday, 20th April 2006 at 10:00am\r\nstarting at the KICC Grounds, and culminating at Uhuru Park\ufffds Freedom Corner.\r\nTODAY IT IS ISAIAH GAKUYO, TOMORROW IT COULD BE YOU OR YOUR LOVED ONE.\r\nNATIONAL EMPOWERMENT NETWORK OF PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV AND AIDS IN\r\nKENYA (NEPHAK) AND OTHER CONCERNED STAKEHOLDERS."}
