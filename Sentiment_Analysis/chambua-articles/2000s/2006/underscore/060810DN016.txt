{"text": "Daily Nation/ Thursday, August 10, 2006\r\nGates gives Sh36bn to Aids fund\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, Wednesday\r\nThe Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation\r\nsaid today it was giving $500 million\r\n(Sh36 billion) to the Global Fund to\r\nFight Aids, TB and Malaria, by far its\r\nbiggest grant to the fund, which says it\r\nsorely lacks cash.\r\nThe money, to be given over five\r\nyears, is the largest private donation to\r\nthe fund, founded nearly five years ago\r\nto serve as the primary financing vehicle\r\nfor efforts to fight the HIV pandemic,\r\ntuberculosis and malaria.\r\nThe fund has always struggled to persuade\r\nrich nations to contribute.\r\n\ufffdEven with this support, it is likely\r\nthat the fund will need an additional\r\n$500 million to reach our goal of $1.1\r\nbillion to fully fund all of the grants that\r\nwe expect to approve for our sixth round\r\nof funding,\ufffd said Mr Richard Feachem,\r\nExecutive Director of the Global Fund.\r\nMr Richard Burzynski of the International\r\nCouncil of Aids Service Organisations\r\nsaid the fund has a predicted $2.1\r\nbillion shortfall for this year and next\r\nyear alone.\r\nSo far, the fund has committed a total\r\nof $5.4 billion in grants, mostly to poor\r\ncountries. It prides itself on making\r\nrecipients account for the money and\r\nearlier this year withdrew some funding\r\nfor Nigeria.\r\n\ufffdThe Global Fund is one of the most\r\nimportant health initiatives in the world\r\ntoday,\ufffd Mr Gates, who founded Microsoft\r\nsaid in a statement.\r\nMr Gates and\r\nt h e f u n d\r\nannounced the\r\ncash gift less than\r\na week before the\r\n16th International\r\nAids Conference,\r\nbeing\r\nheld this year in\r\nToronto. The\r\nGates Foundation\r\npledged $100\r\nmillion to the\r\nFund in 2001, and\r\n$50 million in\r\n2004. The Geneva-based fund, administered\r\nindependently, was responsible for\r\nabout a fifth of all international funding\r\nfor programmes to fight HIV in 2005.\r\nThis included HIV drugs for 544,000\r\npeople, more than 1.4 million people\r\ntreated for TB and more than 11 million\r\nbed nets distributed to protect children\r\nfrom malaria. \ufffdAs we move from crisis\r\nmanagement to a sustained Aids\r\nresponse, we will continue to rely on the\r\nGlobal Fund as the best model to provide\r\nstrategic and predictable funding,\ufffd\r\nsaid Dr Peter Piot, Executive Director of\r\nthe United Nations Aids agency\r\nUNAids.\r\nRecipients also praised the Fund.\r\n\ufffdThe Global Fund has provided us with\r\nthe support we need to drive back Aids\r\nand other diseases, and I am happy to\r\nsee that this contribution will help it continue\r\nto do so for years to come,\ufffd President\r\nPaul Kagame of Rwanda said.\r\n(Reuters)"}
