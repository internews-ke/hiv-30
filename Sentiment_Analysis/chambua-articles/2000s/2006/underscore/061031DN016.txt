{"text": "Daily Nation/ Tuesday, October 31, 2006\r\n\r\nConfused on SA visit,\r\nis this part of Africa?\r\nBy BARRY MOODY\r\nJOHANNESBURG,\r\nMonday\r\n\r\nLanding in Johannesburg\r\nfrom anywhere else in\r\nAfrica can be a deeply disorientating\r\nexperience, no matter\r\nhow many times you do it.\r\nIn fact the contrasts are so great,\r\nyou can end up wondering if you\r\nare still in Africa at all.\r\nConfusion sets in as soon as you\r\nhead into town along a network\r\nof fine roads that would put\r\nLondon to shame, let alone the\r\ndusty potholed streets of most\r\nAfrican cities.\r\nIf there are traffic jams, it is\r\nbecause too many gleaming\r\nBMW, Mercedes and other new\r\ncars are racing home to indulge\r\nthe almost religious devotion to\r\nquality leisure time.\r\nIn Nairobi, where I live, you can\r\nget held up on the main airport\r\nroad at almost any time by the\r\ncrazed antics of battered minibuses\r\nand hoards of scruffy cars\r\nplaying Russian roulette at the\r\nmany roundabouts \ufffd a much\r\nmore typically African experience.\r\nIn another striking contrast, the\r\nplush northern suburbs of\r\nJohannesburg are dotted with\r\nritzy shopping malls where\r\ndesigner stores sell luxury clothing\r\nat European prices.\r\nIn fact, shopping seems to be the\r\nmajor pastime for well-off whites\r\nand blacks, fuelling a retail\r\nboom which the central bank\r\nadmits it is struggling to choke,\r\ndespite rising inflation.\r\nThere are many other signs of\r\nprosperity here. During a recent\r\npublic holiday my inquiry about\r\nbooking a room at a country\r\nhotel was met with a derisive:\r\n\ufffdBut we have been booked up\r\nfor months sir.\ufffd\r\nYet more than a decade after\r\napartheid was defeated, this\r\nprosperity is still one-sided \ufffd\r\nmost of the clients\r\nin the plush\r\nhotels and restaurants\r\nare white\r\nand the staff\r\nblack.\r\nThe private economy,\r\nas opposed\r\nto political power,\r\nis still largely in\r\nwhite hands and\r\nalthough a black\r\nmiddle class is\r\nrapidly expanding,\r\nthe fruits of\r\nblack rule are taking\r\na long time to\r\nreach the majority\r\nof the population.\r\nSome other things also seem\r\nhardly to have changed.\r\nRugby, long the national game, is\r\nstill mostly a white preserve. At a\r\nrecent match against Australia,\r\nmost of the team and almost all\r\nthe crowd were white. Security\r\nmen at the gate appeared to be\r\nthe same beefy, broken-nosed\r\nwhite men as a decade ago, albeit\r\nnow cordial to blacks.\r\nAn impressive network\r\nSouth Africa\ufffds prosperity and\r\ncontrasts are not confined to\r\nJohannesburg. From the graceful\r\nwinelands of the Western Cape\r\nto the beautiful coasts of\r\nKwaZulu-Natal, the entire country\r\nis linked with an impressive\r\nnetwork of well-surfaced roads\r\nthat could not be more of a contrast\r\nto my home in Kenya.\r\nOne of Kenya\ufffds premier tourist\r\nattractions, the Maasai Mara\r\nreserve, is linked to Nairobi by\r\nroads that often resemble a\r\ndried-up river bed, complete\r\nwith rocks and pools of water.\r\nA glance at some statistics\r\nillustrates the\r\ncontrasts.\r\nSouth Africa is the\r\nundisputed economic\r\ngiant of sub-Saharan\r\nAfrica. With six per\r\ncent of the population\r\nit has more than onethird\r\nof the GDP \ufffd\r\nthree times that of\r\nsecond-placed Nigeria\r\nand 40 times more\r\nthan Mali. Nevertheless,\r\ndespite South Africa\ufffds\r\nenormous achievements,\r\noutward\r\nimpressions can obscure\r\nmany challenging problems,\r\nincluding the slow trickle-down\r\nof wealth to the majority.\r\nSouth Africa has some of the\r\nworld\ufffds worst violent crime and\r\nthe greatest caseload of Aids\r\ncases, with one in nine of its 45\r\nmillion population infected with\r\nHIV.\r\nArchbishop Desmond Tutu, the\r\nanti-apartheid hero and South\r\nAfrica\ufffds moral conscience, said\r\nrecently he was deeply concerned\r\nabout crime and the widening\r\ngap between rich and\r\npoor.\r\n\ufffdWe need to be very careful that\r\nthe poor don\ufffdt begin to say\r\n\ufffdWhere is the freedom\r\ndividend?\ufffd... I am very surprised\r\nthat it has taken them so long to\r\nvent their anger and their impatience,\ufffd\r\nhe said. (Reuters)"}
