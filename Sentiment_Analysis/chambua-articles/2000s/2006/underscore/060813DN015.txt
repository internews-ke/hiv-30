{"text": "Sunday Nation/ August 13, 2006\r\n\r\nBar workers vow\r\nto fight for rights\r\n\r\nBy CLAY MUGANDA\r\nDo you know which Kenyan\r\nlager is 100 per\r\ncent rewarding? Or\r\nwhich vodka is premium\r\nand original? Or the cream\r\nthat is served chilled . . . and\r\nenjoyed with ice and friends? If\r\nyou don\ufffdt have the answers, then\r\nyour time is not 17.59, Our Time\r\nor Guinness Time, and neither\r\nare you a responsible adult who\r\ndrinks responsibly.\r\nIf you had attended the First\r\nNational Bar Hostess Conference\r\non HIV and Aids in Kenya at\r\nCity Hall on Thursday and Friday,\r\nyou could haveknown.\r\nThe answers to those questions\r\nwere on banners in the conference\r\nhall \ufffd courtesy of East\r\nAfrica Breweries Limited.\r\nAnd since one good turn\r\ndeserves another, EABL laid out\r\na cocktail that left the ladies\r\nyearning for more. At least there\r\nare people who realise their\r\nimportance in the industry.\r\n\ufffdThe cocktail should have been\r\ntoday,\ufffd Sophia remarked on Friday,\r\nthe last day of the conference.\r\n\ufffdMany of us are aware of\r\nHIV/Aids. Unless our employers\r\nare brought in these discussions,\r\nour rights will just be a mirage.\ufffd\r\nHer sentiments were echoed by\r\nothers at Charter Hall, where bar\r\nhostesses drawn from Uganda,\r\nTanzania and Kenya gathered to\r\ntalk about their rights, working\r\nconditions, and HIV/Aids.\r\n\ufffdWe are not empowered and\r\nwe cannot stand against our\r\nemployers by demanding more\r\nthan what we are given, or complaining\r\nabout the working conditions,\ufffd\r\nsaid Gladys, 24, who works\r\nin a pub in the city centre.\r\n\ufffdYou do that, and you lose\r\nyour job. You cannot feed yourself\r\nand your child on rights.\ufffd\r\nMany of the bar hostesses say\r\nthat they are ready to form a\r\nunion but there is a problem.\r\n\ufffdLegislation should be passed\r\ncompelling bar owners to realise\r\nthe important role we play in the\r\nsociety,\ufffd Sophia said after Justice\r\nMinister Martha Karua had\r\nadvised them to form a union.\r\n\ufffdUnless the bar owners are\r\nbrought on board, we will be\r\nfighting a losing battle.\ufffd\r\nWhile opening the conference\r\non Thursday, Nominated MP\r\nNjoki Ndungu said bar workers\r\nhave a right to say no to sexual\r\nadvances from clients. \ufffdJust\r\nbecause you are a bar professional\r\ndoes not make you commercial\r\nsex worker,\ufffd she said. \ufffdIt is about\r\nconsent, not career.\ufffd Ms Ndungu\r\n\ufffdBring our employers into the discussions\ufffd\r\nCONTINUED ON PAGE 16"}
