{"text": "Daily Nation/ Wednesday, February 1, 2006\r\nThrough powerful stories, Kenyan students tell the world of painful\r\nexperiences with a raging epidemic and give their communities hope\r\n\r\nOf art, masks and war on Aids\r\n\r\nThe students walk up the stage,\r\nwearing masks. One-by-one\r\nthey tell their heart-rending\r\ntales on Aids.\r\nThe colourful masks veil their faces\r\nand give them the courage to speak up\r\nabout the epidemic and its devastating\r\neffects on their communities. The masks\r\nalso seem to give their presentations the\r\npunch, resulting in a powerful collective\r\npicture, one of people who have seen\r\nthe worst of the epidemic \ufffd and their\r\nresolve to roll it back.\r\nFrom behind their veils, the students\r\nnarrate painful experiences with a disease:\r\nHow it has forced them to face\r\nharsh realities at tender ages and left\r\nsome of them destitute by taking away\r\nparents after depleting their resources.\r\nBut in their sad stories lies hope,\r\nthanks to a partnership between Okok\r\nSecondary School in Kisumu District of\r\nNyanza Province and Kiboko Projects,\r\nan American non-governmental organisation\r\nworking with children from\r\ndiverse cultures in campaigning against\r\nthe disease worldwide. The project is\r\nusing schools to reach out to the wider\r\ncommunity with messages on HIV and\r\nAids, providing an avenue for students\r\nand other residents to express themselves\r\nand relate their experiences as\r\none way of coming to terms and coping\r\nwith the epidemic.\r\nStudents address HIV/Aids issues\r\nthrough mask-making, storytelling,\r\nphoto diaries, painting, theatre and\r\nvideo interviews. Through the various\r\nmedia, they capture the challenges of\r\nfamilies ravaged by the epidemic and\r\nthe tribulations children face after the\r\ndeath of their parents and relatives.\r\nCorrect misperception\r\nOne aim of the project is to spread\r\nthe message far and wide. That is\r\nwhy Okok has been linked to Eleanor\r\nRoosevelt High School in New York\r\nCity in an exchange programme that\r\nencourages sharing of experiences. It is\r\nhoped the exchanges will correct misperception\r\nby students from both countries\r\nand create a common understanding\r\non how to fight the epidemic.\r\nFor Jenipher Anyango, a 14-year-old\r\nForm One student, the project has\r\nopened her eyes and strengthened her\r\nresolve to do something to contain the\r\nspread of HIV, the virus that causes\r\nAids.\r\nAnyango, who is among the girls\r\ninvolved in making masks and recording\r\nvideo interviews, says working with\r\nthese media has given her courage to\r\nspeak openly about HIV and Aids,\r\nwhich she could not do in the past due\r\nto the stigma attached to the disease.\r\n\ufffdThis way of communicating gives\r\nyou the courage to speak. With a mask\r\ncovering your face, you get to speak\r\nopenly and the veil of fear is also lifted,\ufffd\r\nshe says.\r\nAnyango says she can now face the\r\nworld and her peers to talk openly\r\nabout the epidemic.\r\n\ufffdI didn\ufffdt know the youth have a role\r\nto play in the society\r\nby speaking openly\r\nand boldly on issues\r\nthat affect not only us,\r\nbut also our elders.\r\nThrough the exposure\r\nwe have to work by\r\nstudents in other parts\r\nof the world through\r\nthis project, a sense of duty has been\r\ninstilled in us and we are prepared for\r\nthe challenges.\ufffd\r\nAnyango says young people should be\r\nhelped to take up their roles in the society\r\nby being exposed to activities that\r\nprepare them for such roles. Says the\r\nteenager: \ufffdIt is our duty as much as it is\r\nfor the older people to address issues\r\nrelated to Aids as they equally affect\r\nand infect us, but without such exposure,\r\nwhich builds self-confidence in us, we\r\ncannot effectively play our part.\ufffd\r\nPaul Bugi, 17, agrees. The Form\r\nThree student says his personal experience\r\nwith the artistic projects, especially\r\nm a s k -\r\nmaking, has\r\ngiven him a\r\nbetter view\r\nof how to\r\ndeal with\r\ni s s u e s\r\nrelated to\r\nt h e\r\nepidemic.\r\n\ufffdIt was not easy before, but my experience\r\nwith the masks and paintings has\r\ninvigorated and encouraged me to\r\naddress these issues,\ufffd he says.\r\nThe school\ufffds principal, Mr Kariako\r\nMalachi, says the Kiboko activities have\r\nnot only instilled confidence in his students,\r\nbut have also unlocked their\r\npotential.\r\n\ufffdThrough the projects, we have seen\r\npotential journalists conducting interviews\r\nand also artists-in-the-making\r\ncommunicate through powerful paintings\r\nand drawings,\ufffd he said.\r\nKiboko Projects was started seven\r\nyears ago by New York artists Mark\r\nScheflen and Jill Raufman. It has since\r\ngrown into a flourishing cultural organisation\r\nthat has organised workshops,\r\nexhibitions, and cultural exchange programmes\r\non three continents.\r\nNeglected children\r\nIt aims to provide \ufffdopportunities for\r\nartistic and creative expression to individuals,\r\nsome of whom have had limited\r\naccess to this experience\ufffd.\r\nThe organisation reaches out to communities\r\nthrough art and education,\r\nencouraging people of all ages and\r\ndiverse background to tell their \ufffdunfiltered\ufffd\r\nstories to the world. For instance,\r\nin Kiboko Projects you will find people\r\nranging from those living with\r\nHIV/Aids, the physically and mentally\r\nhandicapped, children from neglectful\r\nfamilies, immigrants and ex-convicts, to\r\nstudents and professional artists.\r\nExhibitions are an important vehicle\r\nfor linking people from various communities\r\ntaking part in the project. Last\r\nyear, works by Kenyan communities featured\r\nin one such show in St Petersburg,\r\nbringing the reality of Aids in Africa to\r\nthe people of the second largest city in\r\nRussia, where Aids is becoming a matter\r\nof concern.\r\nThe show, hosted by the Artists\r\nUnion of Russia, featured five diverse\r\nprojects created through workshops with\r\nartists, students and families in Kenya,\r\nAmerica and St Petersburg itself. On\r\ndisplay were hand-painted masks and\r\ninsightful photo diaries.\r\nNeglected children\r\nAlso on show were videos telling\r\ncompelling stories: A family of children\r\naged 13-18 years orphaned by Aids;\r\na young woman who turned to prostitution\r\nto pay her school fees; a 29-year-old\r\nfather of four struggling to make sure his\r\nchildren are cared for after he dies of\r\nAids-related illnesses.\r\nMs Raufman, Kiboko Projects executive\r\ndirector, says she has learnt to\r\nappreciate the power of arts. \ufffdThe\r\nyoung and old have been able to pass\r\ninformation though arts, helping not\r\nonly in the war against Aids but also\r\novercoming other challenges.\ufffd\r\nMs Raufman believes fighting stigma\r\nis important strategy in the war on Aids:\r\n\ufffdPeople need to know about it, that\ufffds\r\nwhen the stigma starts to fall off.\ufffd\r\nMr Scheflen, a photographer/teacher\r\nand former construction worker, is not\r\nnew to Kenya. He first visited the country\r\nin 1985 and was moved by the people\ufffds\r\nwarmth. He was to return a year\r\nlater to Kituvi village in Eastern Province\r\nto put up a three-room house for his\r\nhosts.\r\nHe recalls how villagers \ufffdbecome construction\r\nworkers or artisans\ufffd and joined\r\nhim to build what he calls his \ufffdsecond\r\nhome\ufffd.\r\nWhen he retured to America, he compiled\r\nphotos, videos and an intimate\r\njournal of his observations into a fascinating\r\nshow of his days in Kenya. He has\r\nsince displayed the showcase in galleries,\r\nuniversities and public exhibition spaces\r\nin New York City.\r\nBesides his own works, Mr Scheflen is\r\ndisplaying drawings and paintings by\r\nChildren of Makueni and Machakos."}
