{"text": "Daily Nation/ Friday, August 18, 2006\r\n\r\nRequest for a Consultant to Evaluate HACI.\r\nThe Hope for African Children Initiative (HACI) is a pan-African effort established by leading\r\nglobal humanitarian organizations namely; Plan, Care, Network of African People Living\r\nwith HIV/AIDS (NAP+), Save the Children Alliance, the Society for Women and AIDS in\r\nAfrica (SWAA), World Conference on Religions for Peace (WCRP) and World Vision\r\nInternational. Through this effort, these organizations work together to increase the capacity\r\nof local communities to provide prevention, care and support services to African children\r\nand their families affected by HIV/AIDS. The initiative specifically addresses the challenges\r\nfaced by children orphaned by AIDS in Africa, and the millions whose parents are sick or\r\ndying from opportunistic infections caused by HIV.\r\nHACI\ufffds core priorities are:\r\n1. Expanding the network of local African organizations working to address AIDS-related\r\nchallenges.\r\n2. Providing financial, material, and technical support to communities so that they can\r\nadequately care for children affected by AIDS, by implementing programs that\r\nempower the family, children and communities to access social services in a\r\nsustainable manner.\r\n3. Supporting local advocates and religious leaders in their efforts to engage government\r\nand encourage policy formulation pertaining to AIDS-related issues.\r\nHACI is currently implementing OVC programs in nine (9) countries in Africa. Currently, the\r\nHACI focus countries are Cameroon, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique,\r\nSenegal, Uganda and Zambia.\r\nVarious donors have funded HACI to-date among them the Bill and Melinda Gates\r\nFoundation, Plan Netherlands, Plan Finland, Plan Norway, SIDA Regional HIV/AIDS Team,\r\nand PEPFAR. After six years of program implementation, the Core partners who form HACI\r\nand the Initiative\ufffds Stakeholders have decided to assess the progress, achievements,\r\nlessons and challenges of implementing OVC programming using the HACI model,\r\nstructure and approach.\r\nThis evaluation is also rooted in the genuine desire of parties involved to reflect and learn\r\nfrom the project/programme undertaken. Through this evaluation, HACI would also like to\r\ntake stock of its operations and programs now that the initiative has been operational for\r\nalmost six years. The Secretariat of HACI would like to undertake a major evaluation of\r\nHACI both at the regional and national levels. This evaluation will inform the current\r\nprocess of re-thinking the strategic directions of HACI in two major areas: Program focus\r\nand Institutional set up.\r\nThe overall objectives of the evaluation are:\r\nI. To assess whether the set programme/project objectives have been efficiently and\r\neffectively achieved\r\nII. To assess how the programme/project contributed to the objectives set in the policy &\r\nprogramme framework of Plan Sweden and Plan Nederland.\r\nThe evaluation will be expected to achieve a number of objectives. For each of the areas,\r\nthe evaluation will address what has worked and what has not worked and why? The\r\nevaluation will provide a better understanding of country-specific results for children,\r\ncost-effectiveness, fundraising horizons, universe of players addressing OVC needs, office\r\ncapacities, etc. to inform the future vision. The evaluation will also attempt to answer,\r\namong many other questions, the following: What does the data tell us about country\r\noperations? Should Country programs include all HACI\ufffds four priority activities: do they add\r\nvalue locally? How sustainable are they? Might it have been better to endorse a more\r\nneeds- and market-driven \ufffdmenu approach\ufffd where country operations would be tailored to\r\nneeds/opportunities, aiming to fill gaps? Standing in the future, how could HACI succeed in\r\nachieving its expectations?\r\nInterested individuals or firms should request for detailed scope of work from\r\ninfo@hacisecretariat.org not later than August 25, 2006."}
