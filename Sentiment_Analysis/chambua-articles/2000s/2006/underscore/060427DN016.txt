{"text": "Daily Nation/ Thursday, April 27, 2006\r\nVatican yet\r\nto decide on\r\nnew condom\r\ndirective\r\n\r\nVATICAN CITY, Wednesday\r\nThe Vatican is studying whether condoms\r\ncan be condoned to help stem the\r\ntide of Aids and a host of other bioethical\r\nissues such as stem cell research, but\r\nthere is no indication of when or whether\r\nit would pronounce itself on the matter,\r\nofficials said.\r\nCardinal Javier Lozano Barragan, who\r\nheads the Vatican office for health care,\r\nwas quoted over the weekend in Italy\ufffds\r\nLa Repubblica daily as saying his office\r\nwas preparing a document on the question\r\nof condoms and Aids, and that it\r\nwould be released soon.\r\nBut yesterday, he clarified that his\r\noffice was merely studying the issue at\r\nthe request of the Pope as part of a\r\nbroader \ufffddialogue\ufffd with other Vatican\r\ndepartments.\r\n\ufffdWe are conducting a very profound\r\nscientific, technical and moral study\ufffd on\r\nhow to deal with married couples when\r\none is infected with HIV, he told Vatican\r\nRadio.\r\nHe said the study would be presented\r\nto Pope Benedict XVI, \ufffdwho with his\r\nwisdom and the help of the Holy Spirit\r\nwill take a decision and tell us where we\r\nare going.\ufffd While the Vatican has no\r\nspecific policy concerning condoms and\r\nAids, the Catholic Church opposes the\r\nuse of condoms as part of its overall\r\nteaching against contraception. It advocates\r\nsexual abstinence as the best way to\r\ncombat the spread of HIV, the virus that\r\ncauses Aids.\r\nThe issue was reignited last week when\r\na one-time papal contender, retired\r\nMilan Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini, said\r\nthat condoms were the \ufffdlesser evil in\r\ncombating the spread of Aids.
