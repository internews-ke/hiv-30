{"text": "DAILY NATION\r\nFriday December 1, 2006\r\n\r\nMINISTRY OF HEALTH\r\nDecember 1st each year marks a global event dedicated to remembering the infected and\r\naffected by Aids, learning more about the devastating effects of the disease around the\r\nworld, and reaffirming the commitment to fight it.\r\nThis year\ufffds theme \ufffdSTOP AIDS, KEEP THE PROMISE\ufffd reflects on the effects of\r\nHIV/AIDS. The devastation brought by HIV/AIDS is so acute that it has become one of\r\nthe main obstacles to development itself. We therefore must join hands to stop it.\r\nLadies and gentlemen, two-thirds of new infections are occuring in the region, translating\r\nin 3.2 million infections each year. The increasing trend of HIV/aids infection at alarming\r\nlevels dictate that special measures and \ufffdemergency actions be taken to stop further\r\nspread of the scourge on the continent. however, we cannot forget to highlight the falling\r\nprevalence in our country.\r\nAs you are aware, the response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic proposed in the national aids\r\nstrategic plan comprises three broadly defined intervention areas:\r\n\ufffd Prevention of new infections;\r\n\ufffd Care and support for those infected or affected by HIV/AIDS\r\n\ufffd Mitigation of the impact of the epidemic on economic and social development efforts.\r\nWith the above in mind, we hope this commemoration will among others bring increased\r\ncommitment for increased HIV Prevention in Kenya and African region as a whole. During 2005, the Ministers of Health held in line\r\nwith the declaration and road map towards a summit in Gaberone in 2001, there followed a resolution calling for Member States to\r\nintensify HIV Prevention efforts. The resolution also called for the declaration of year 2006 as the year for acceleration of HIV\r\nprevalence in Kenya our prevention program have achieved\r\nacceleration of HIV prevention is an important intervention and it takes place within the ambit of the universal access that provides\r\na new momentum to scale up and integrate prevention, and support with the goal of reaching universal access by 2010.\r\nLadies and gentlemen, the national HIV/aids strategic plan is to enable the government to play its leadership role in aids prevention\r\nand control activities. of late, there has been a high level of political goodwill by the government to scale up HIV/aids prevention\r\nand care.\r\nIN THE MEANTIME, WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO INTENSIFY OUR OWN CAMPAIGN AGAINST AIDS, INCLUDING:\r\n\ufffd A sustained public awareness campaign encouraging safe sex and the use of condoms;\r\n\ufffd A better focused programme targeted at the reduction and elimination of poverty and the improvement of the\r\nnutritional standards of our people;\r\n\ufffd A concerted fight against opportunistic diseases, including the and all sexually transmitted diseases; with HIV\r\nand AIDS as well as the orphans in our society;\r\n\ufffd Contributing to the international effort to develop an aids vaccine; and,\r\n\ufffd Further research on Anti-retroviral drugs.\r\nLadies and Gentlemen, it is through continued collaborations, that we wil l be able to harmonize our efforts in the administration of\r\na comprehensive response towards the HIV/AIDS spread.\r\nThank you all.\r\nToday, with people around the world, not just here in our country, we turn our\r\nthoughts to the more than 40 million men, women, and children who are living\r\nwith HIV/AIDS that\ufffds what world AIDS day is all about and on World AIDS Day,\r\nwe renew our commitment to turn the tide against this disease.\r\nIt is alarming that each year, more than 2 million people lose their lives to\r\nHIV/AIDS in Subsaharan Africa and that in 2004 alone, more than 3 million\r\ninfections occurred in the African region.\r\nIt is our concern that programming and implementation of the existing\r\nevidence-based and cost effective interventions for HIV prevention have not\r\nbeen on a sufficient scale and that new infections are still occurring at unacceptability\r\nhigh levels. This has made us to scale-up the prevention measures\r\nand behavioural change communication to young people aged between 15-24\r\nyears. With the HIV prevalence rate going down to about 6% in Kenya, we\r\nneed not to celebrate yet for we have to renew our commitment and accelerate\r\nprevention of the pandemic before we lose all our gains. Stakeholders in\r\nKenya and Africa as a region need to accelerate the scale-up of prevention\r\nprogrammes which target the youth, women, girls and other vulnerable groups\r\nincluding the sex workers. Young people are exposed to HIV in different ways\r\nin Subsaharan Africa, the main mode of transmission is heterosexual intercourse.\r\nThis region contains almost two-thirds of all young people living with\r\nHIV - approximately 6.2 million people, 75% of whom are youngsters.\r\nChallenges posed by AIDS call for a multisectoral approach, thus bringing together a diversity of actors such as the\r\nprivate organisations and non-governmental organisations each contributing and complementing in its specialised\r\narea of HIV/AIDS management. The Ministry of Health through National Aids and STD control programme (NASCOP)\r\nin collaboration with our development partners have made a tremendous progress towards the scaling-up of prevention\r\nprograms such as mother-to-child transmission of HIV/AIDS, VCT and other prevention measures in Kenya.\r\nScale-up has also been done through communication materials (IEC) and advocacy initiatives - between health\r\nproviders and communities, between community leaders and communities, between communities and positive people,\r\namong family members, neighbours, and among young people.\r\nThe progress made in implementing the 3 by 5 initiative is encouraging and we are concerned that scaling-up\r\ntreatment and care offer a good /opportunity for accelerating HIV prevention efforts. I urge Kenyans to continue going\r\nfor voluntary HIV Counselling and testing regardless of their marital status. This will help them make decisions to stay\r\nnegative if they are not yet infected. On behalf of the Ministry of Health, l would like to extend my thanks and\r\nencouragement to our development partners and all stakeholders who tirelessly are engaged in the fight against\r\nHIV/AIDS.\r\nNASCOP PROGRAMMES\r\n1. VCT Programme\r\n2. PMTCT/STI Programme\r\n3. HOME BASED CARE (HBC) PROGRAMME\r\n4. ART PROGRAMME\r\nNASCOP achievements\r\nThere has been significant increase in number of Kenyans tested for HIV and close receiving ARVs, improved surveillance and quality laboratory services, development of training materials for\r\nPMTCT, VCT, TB and diagnostic testing and counseling. Guidelines for HIV testing in a clinical setting have been developed and AIDS in Kenya a publication highlighting HIV/AIDS trends,\r\ninterventions and impacts has been launched. Better practices in PMTCT launched.\r\nWay forward on NASCOP activities\r\nThere should be standardization of materials and data capture tools, community mobilization for increased service uptake should be intensified. There should also be increased co-ordination between\r\npartners and development agencies. Improvement should be done in several areas such as physical infrastructure at health facilities, health management information systems and logistics\r\nmanagement. Finally, there should be a reduction in the cost of drugs and laboratory tests."}
