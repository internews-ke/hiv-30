{"text": "Sunday Nation/July 23, 2006\r\nAfrica gets cold shrug at G8\r\n\r\nBy IRUNGU HOUGHTON and LAUREN GELFAND\r\nThe gates of the Konstantinovsky Imperial\r\nPalace have clanged shut after this year\ufffds\r\nsummit of the world\ufffds leading industrialised\r\nnations, having left Africa and its fight\r\nagainst poverty on the outside looking in.\r\nAfter a year of promise spawned by the hopeful\r\ndevelopment agenda from last year\ufffds summit\r\nof the G8 nations, the distance between\r\npromise and performance on behalf of the 800\r\nmillion people on the world\ufffds poorest continent\r\nhas never been so pronounced.\r\nA year on from a relief package that wiped\r\n100 per cent of multilateral debt off the books\r\nof 14 African nations accompanied by pledges\r\nof an extra $25 billion per year until 2010, barely\r\na symbolic gesture was made in St.\r\nPetersburg towards alleviating the woes that\r\nkeep millions of Africans in poverty, without\r\naccess to clean water or schoolbooks, basic\r\nhealth care or electricity.\r\nBy downplaying the fight against poverty, the\r\nG8 ignored the world\ufffds most critical crisis, one\r\nthat will kill 11 million children by the time\r\nthey next meet.\r\nIn the run-up to the St. Petersburg summit, it\r\nwas clear that global priorities to enhance\r\nAfrica\ufffds development had changed: gone were\r\nthe deals for debt-relief, support for teachers\r\nand health care workers and commitments to\r\nending agricultural subsidies.\r\nInstead there was an agenda suited to rich\r\ncountries, dominated by energy and industrial\r\ntrade. The continent was not being ignored, the\r\nindustrial super-powers were quick to reassure:\r\njust temporarily overlooked. After all, Africa is\r\nsupposed to take centre-stage at next year\ufffds\r\nsummit of the G8.\r\nBut as the farmers of cotton and coffee, sugar\r\nand rice from Mali to Ethiopia to Mozambique\r\nand Zambia know all-too-well, it\ufffds never temporary.\r\nAsk the millions in Democratic\r\nRepublic of Congo without basic humanitarian\r\nservices like clean water or enough to eat, or the\r\nformer child soldiers in Sierra Leone without\r\njobs or an education: they too have borne the\r\nbrunt of that supposed short-term indifference.\r\nOn a continent wracked by bloody and\r\nunwieldy conflict, hamstrung by unfair trade\r\npractices and silenced by diseases such as\r\nAIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, temporary\r\nhas permanent consequences.\r\nHumanitarian emergencies do not slow\r\ndown while the international community\r\ndithers in fulfilling its commitments: they continue\r\ntheir acceleration, sweeping ever-larger\r\nswathes of countries in crisis.\r\nCompetition for dwindling resources is not\r\nsuspended in anticipation of ever-imminent\r\ndeliveries of aid: it smoulders, then intensifies,\r\nthen explodes.\r\nAfrica cannot afford another explosion: too\r\nmuch has been achieved to begin an inexorable\r\nbackslide into ignominy and indifference.\r\nOver the next 365 days, industrialised\r\nnations must show that their attention to Africa\r\nhas not waned, that their commitments to sustainable\r\nand durable development have not\r\nwavered. Support for the continent must\r\ninclude consistent funding for reconciliation\r\nand rehabilitation for countries that have managed\r\nto extricate themselves from conflict.\r\nPeace-keeping operations must be reinforced,\r\nwell-resourced and carefully monitored\r\nas harbingers of security. Accompanying\r\nhumanitarian needs must be addressed swiftly\r\nand completely to prevent one country\ufffds challenge\r\nfrom becoming another country\ufffds problem.\r\nThe coffers of the Global Fund for AIDS,\r\nmalaria and tuberculosis must be filled, so as\r\nto reduce HIV prevalence among young people\r\nby one-quarter and improve access to treatment\r\nfor 80 per cent of the millions living with\r\nHIV in Africa.\r\nNext year\ufffds G8 summit will mark the\r\nhalfway point in the global effort to achieve\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals of halving\r\npoverty, increasing access to education\r\nand stopping the spread of AIDS.\r\nTo leave Africa outside the gates again, a\r\ncasualty of temporary indifference, would be a\r\ntragedy of unimaginable proportions.\r\nPerhaps what the continent needs over the\r\nnext 365 days, then, is a people\ufffds jury of 800\r\nmillion African men, women and children pronouncing\r\njudgement on the world\ufffds leaders.\r\nPerhaps then the world could close the gap\r\nbetween promise and performance, and the\r\ncontinent will rise.\r\nMr Houghton is Pan Africa Policy Officer while\r\nGelfand is West Africa Media Officer for Oxfam\r\nGreat Britain"}
