{"text": "Saturday Nation/ July 8, 2006\r\n\r\nSouth Africa\ufffds drug stores\r\nhit by change to price rules\r\n\r\nBy JAMES MACHARIA\r\nSmall South African pharmacies say\r\nthey are being squeezed out of business\r\nby new medicine pricing rules\r\ndrafted by the government to make\r\ndrugs more affordable in Africa\ufffds biggest\r\neconomy.\r\nThe health department says capped prices\r\nwill save consumers up to Sh31 billion ($427.1\r\nmillion) a year, but pharmacists say the government\r\nis driving small rural pharmacies out\r\nof business, hurting the people it was\r\nintended to help.\r\nOver-the-counter\r\nMedicine prices are a particularly sensitive\r\nsubject in South Africa, which has the world\ufffds\r\nsecond biggest caseload of HIV and Aids\r\nwith about five million people infected, and\r\nwhere many are not covered by medical\r\ninsurance to help pay for medicines.\r\n\ufffdWith me shutting down, it\ufffds the poorest in\r\nthis rural area that will suffer most,\ufffd says\r\nlocal pharmacist Robbie van Kerkhof\r\nSteep losses meant he had to shut down his\r\n40-year-old business in Steinsburg, a town of\r\nabout 16,000 people in the Eastern Cape\r\nprovince where it was the only pharmacy, he\r\nsaid.\r\nTo obtain over-the-counter drugs, local\r\npeople would either have to pay consultation\r\nfees to see a doctor who can then dispense\r\nthe drugs, or travel to nearby towns to get\r\ntheir medicine, he said. Pharmacists say many\r\nmedical insurance companies were backing\r\nthe price caps because it meant the insurers\r\nwould pay out much less in prescription drug\r\nclaims.\r\nClive Stanton, head of the Pharmaceutical\r\nSociety of South Africa, says 103 small pharmacies\r\naround the country had shut by the\r\nlast official count conducted by his group in\r\nNovember last year, most blaming the price\r\ncaps.\r\n\ufffdSince then a lot more have gone,\ufffd he said.\r\nSmall pharmacists say besides the price caps,\r\nthe government also opened up the medicines\r\nsector for entry by big companies, a\r\ndouble blow to the smaller stores.\r\nThe government had hoped this would\r\nspread new outlets in rural areas, but most\r\nhave launched in cities.\r\n\ufffdThis is a double blow, it is not just the\r\n(capped) prices that have driven me out of\r\nbusiness,\ufffd said Loius Botha,\r\nwho shut his pharmacy at a\r\nPort Elizabeth mall in February.\r\nNtobeko Mpanza of the\r\nhealth department\ufffds drug\r\npricing unit said the government\r\ncould not deny\r\nlicences to those qualified,\r\nor prevent companies from launching new\r\noutlets in big malls.\r\nAnother to fall in the wake of the entry of\r\nthe bigger rivals was Louis Deenik, who says\r\nhis family-run pharmacy based at the smart\r\nSandton City mall in Johannesburg shut its\r\ndoors for the last time at the end of May.\r\nAs a result, 15 workers lost their jobs. \ufffdIt\ufffds\r\nbeen one long struggle downwards,\ufffd he said,\r\nadding that small pharmacies were having to\r\nmerge to survive, while some had been\r\nswallowed up by larger rivals.\r\nPeter Giltrow, owner of another pharmacy\r\nin Port Elizabeth, said that for the\r\naverage person medicine prices were too\r\nhigh, but there could have been a better\r\nway to curb them to minimise the fallout\r\non pharmacies. The Pharmaceutical Society\ufffds\r\nStanton conceded that, in spite of the\r\nclosures, the new rules had substantially\r\ncut drug prices for consumers.\r\n\ufffdPatients are getting a cheaper service,\r\nbut the problem is that in some areas they\r\nwill get no service at all,\ufffd he said. What the\r\nnew measures boiled down to was a transition\r\nof pharmacy ownership from small to\r\nbigger players, he said. One such big\r\nplayer is drugs and cosmetics retailer New\r\nClicks. Its pharmacy unit has also struggled\r\nunder the new price curbs\r\nbut the group has weathered\r\nthe storm because of\r\nits diversified business.\r\nClicks pharmacy unit suffered\r\na 38-million-rand loss\r\nin the year to August 2005.\r\nClicks and other pharmacies\r\nlaunched a storm of\r\nprotest, and won a court battle against the\r\ninitial version of the price caps. The government\r\nwas ordered back to the drawing\r\nboard, and has since drafted a new set now\r\nbeing debated in the sector.\r\nThe new caps propose a sliding scale\r\nthat keeps fees low for the cheapest drugs,\r\nlimiting pharmacists to charging 7 rand\r\nplus 28 percent of the purchase price for\r\ndrugs priced below 75 rand.
