{"text": "Daily Nation/ Thursday, April 20, 2006\r\n\r\nMen use catch as bait in their quest to seduce women who need credit\r\nand this increases the prevalence of STDs on the shores of Lake Victoria\r\n\r\nSex-for-fish\r\ntrade thrives\r\ndespite Aids\r\n\r\nBy JOHN OYWA\r\nThe morning breeze swept\r\nacross the vast lake, whirling\r\nthe murky waters into furious\r\nwaves. Two motorised boats,\r\nweighed down by a bountiful harvest of\r\nfish, bobbed and rumbled as they raced\r\nto the beach.\r\nThe arrival of the vessels stirred up\r\nUhanya, one of the busiest beaches on\r\nthe shores of Lake Victoria. Women,\r\ndraped in khangas and armed with\r\nbasins and baskets, scrambled for fish as\r\nthe coxswain angrily called for order.\r\nAs a crowd gathered, a fisherman\r\nwhose boat had just docked, roared at\r\nthe traders: \ufffdThere is no credit today.\ufffd\r\nStanding on a rocky patch, 30-yearold\r\nAnastasia Onguko stared into the\r\ndistant hills, disappointment etched on\r\nher face.\r\nThe previous day, she had tried to get\r\nfish on credit and walked away in protest\r\nafter a fisherman demanded sex in\r\nexchange for fish worth Sh300.\r\nFishy affair\r\nA newcomer to the beach, Mrs Onguko\r\nwas yet to come to terms with the\r\nunwritten rule of \ufffdNo sex, no fish\ufffd for\r\nthe poor women fish mongers.\r\nThe sex-for-fish trade that has characterized\r\nthe fishing industry, scares her\r\nstiff, yet she has limited options. To sustain\r\nher small scale fish trade, she has to\r\nidentify and befriend one of the fishermen\r\nwho will give her fish on credit.\r\nA widow and a mother of three, Mrs\r\nOnguko had been warned that without\r\njaboya (fisherman boyfriend), her budding\r\nfish trade was doomed.\r\nShe is among hundreds of impoverished\r\nwomen whose lives are woven\r\naround the intricate fishing industry.\r\nWomen here trade on tilapia, omena\r\nand Nile Perch.\r\nThe sex-for-fish culture has increased\r\nthe HIV rate on the shores of Lake Victoria\r\nand experts say the situation is\r\nquickly getting out of hand.\r\nThe Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock\r\nestimated that 75 per cent of\r\nwomen who work on the beaches have\r\ncome from other regions. Most of them\r\nare widows, divorcees and spinsters\r\nstruggling to make a living.\r\nAbundant supplies\r\nA large number of these women are\r\npoor. They trade on credit, getting fish\r\nto sell then paying for their supplies several\r\ndays later.\r\nGovernment records show that more\r\nthan 60 per cent of the lake basin communities\r\nlive in abject poverty despite\r\nthe abundant fish supplies.\r\nThe school drop out rate, especially\r\namong girls in the beach communities, is\r\namong the highest in the country.\r\nIn Suba District, for example, seven in\r\nevery 10 girls who enrol in Standard\r\nOne, drop out before they reach Standard\r\nEight, according to the Institute for\r\nEconomic Affairs\ufffd \ufffdLittle Fact Book\ufffd.\r\nIn Busia, only about 17 per cent of\r\npupils who finish primary school join\r\nsecondary school. The trend is similar in\r\nother lakeside districts.\r\nAn educationist, Ms Jenipher Kere,\r\nwho has been leading a campaign to\r\nempower women in the fishing industry,\r\nsays poverty among women makes them\r\nvulnerable to sexual demands from their\r\nsuppliers, especially when they fail to\r\npay.\r\nWomen have been marginalised in\r\nthe fishing industry yet they play a crucial\r\nrole, especially in the post harvest of\r\nfish, she says.\r\nMs Kere\ufffds Women In the Fishing\r\nProject (WIFIP) has waged a massive\r\neducation campaign on the beaches to\r\nhelp reverse the trend.\r\n\ufffdWomen trading in fish are a desperate\r\nlot. They not only need education\r\nbut economic empowerment. They also\r\nneed health facilities,\ufffd said Ms Kere.\r\nOn the shores of Lake Victoria,\r\nfrom Busia in Western Province\r\nto Muhuru Bay in Migori District,\r\nwomen are being forced into sexual\r\nslavery as they struggle to survive\r\nharsh economic times.\r\nIn 2002, a non-governmental organisation,\r\nTraining and Advocacy for Community\r\nInitiative, helped to rescue 21\r\nschool dropouts, who were being\r\nexploited by fishermen in Suba District.\r\nWith funding from the United\r\nNations Children\ufffds Fund (Unicef) and\r\nWatoto Kwanza Trust, the organisation\r\nused chiefs to recruit the girls into a tailoring\r\ntraining project.\r\nThe girls who were each presented\r\nwith sewing machines after the training,\r\ntold of horrid tales at the hands of the\r\nfishermen. Many of them were orphans\r\nwho traded in fish to feed their siblings.\r\nTo fishing communities, sex-for-fish is\r\na common practice even as health\r\nexperts blame it for the high HIV/Aids\r\nprevalence on the beaches. To these\r\ncommunities, women having joboya is a\r\ntradition.\r\nChanging partners is common. Men,\r\nironically bar their women from participating\r\nin fishing activities apparently to\r\nprotect them from the polluted environment,\r\nyet they enjoy secret sex from\r\nwidowed and unmarried women.\r\nBeach management officials downplay\r\nthe problem and see no sin in\r\nwomen fish traders befriending those\r\nsupplying them with fish.\r\nThe Government and\r\nsome development agencies\r\nare alarmed at the\r\nexploitation of women\r\non the beaches.\r\nA district officer for\r\nNyatike in Migori District,\r\nMr Charles Muiruri,\r\nrecently blew the whistle on the sexfor-\r\nfish problem, saying it had increased\r\nAids-related infections.\r\nMr Muiruri said poor women working\r\non the beaches were forced into sex to\r\nget fish to sell. He said the problem was\r\nrampant on nearly all the 300 beaches of\r\nLake Victoria.\r\nA one-week surveillance by the Nation\r\nconfirmed that the practice was\r\nrampant on the beaches and unearthed\r\ndeeply-rooted moral decay, fuelled by\r\nhigh illiteracy levels, ignorance and crippling\r\npoverty.\r\nMany girls who drop out of school\r\ndue to poverty or after losing their parents\r\nto Aids, fall easy prey to joboya.\r\nMany of them trade in fish to fend for\r\nthemselves and their siblings and are\r\nforced by poverty to befriend the fishermen\r\nwho supply them with free fish.\r\nIn a culture where women are prohibited\r\nfrom going into the lake to fish, men\r\ntake advantage and exploit them.\r\nAmong the lake communities of Nyanza\r\nand Western provinces, women are only\r\nallowed to smoke fish, dry it then sell it.\r\nFor many years, randy fishermen have\r\nused fish to lure women and young girls\r\ninto sex.\r\nDuring low season when fish is scarce,\r\nonly women with joboya survive.\r\nIn such seasons, it does not matter\r\nwhether you have money or not. The\r\nfishermen will serve their lovers first.\r\nIn some of the beaches, men defended\r\nthe practice, saying it was a natural\r\nfriendship between a man and a woman\r\nand had nothing to do with fish.\r\n\ufffdWe don\ufffdt call it sex-for-fish here\r\nbecause nobody forces the women into\r\naffairs. We don\ufffdt have such cases on our\r\nbeach,\ufffd said Mr Salim Juma, a member\r\nof Nyangwina Beach Management Unit\r\nin Muhuru Bay.\r\nA local councillor, Samuel Orore concurs.\r\n\ufffdWe have heard about fish-for-sex,\r\nbut not on our beach. What happens\r\nhere is a natural man-woman relationship,\ufffd\r\nhe says.\r\nBut a local businesswoman, Mrs Janet\r\nPaul, laughs off the denials. \ufffdFish-forsex\r\nissue is an open secret here. Both\r\nyoung and old women offer their bodies\r\nin exchange for fish,\ufffd she whispered to\r\nus.\r\nAt Nambo Beach in Bondo District, a\r\nwomen\ufffds group leader, Mrs Mary Ouko,\r\nspeaks boldly about what she terms the\r\nbiggest sexual slavery of our times.\r\nShe says the practice has been rampant.\r\n\ufffdIt has been a serious issue and\r\nwomen knew they couldn\ufffdt get fish if\r\nthey didn\ufffdt befriend the fishermen.\r\nMrs Ouko says the Banda Nyatiti\r\nWomen\ufffds group, which she chairs, has\r\nbeen spearheading a campaign to end\r\nthis practice. They educate the fishermen\r\nand the fish mongers and distribute\r\ncondoms.\r\nMrs Ouko\ufffds group has received funding\r\nfrom WIFIP and ActionAid to conduct\r\nHIV/Aids awareness campaigns\r\nand to start micro-finance credit\r\nfacilities.\r\nAt Uhanya beach, fishermen\r\ndeny they are sexually exploiting\r\nwomen traders. The beach\r\nchairman, Mr James Oracho\r\nWire, says most of the affairs\r\nw e r e s e c r e t p r i v a t e\r\narrangements.\r\nThe women, he says, have not\r\ncomplained to his office. \ufffdThese\r\nare adults and we cannot tell them how\r\nto go about their private lives\ufffd, said Mr\r\nOracho.\r\nA beach management unit clerk, Mrs\r\nDorine Atieno, calls fish-for-sex was a\r\nreality. \ufffdSome women do it because they\r\ncan\ufffdt afford to buy fish. Others are just\r\nimmoral,\ufffd she says.\r\nShe blames womenfolk for the situation\r\nas many of them have refused to\r\ntake up positions in the Beach Management\r\nUnits so that they can use their\r\npositions to campaign for changes.\r\n\ufffdI am the only woman in the committee,\ufffd\r\nsays Ms Atieno, a fisherman\ufffds wife.\r\nAlarmed by the high number of people\r\nliving with HIV/AIDS around\r\nUhanya beach, a group of women have\r\nformed a group to care for the sick children\r\norphaned by the disease.\r\nMeanwhile the fishy trade continues\r\nunabated."}
