{"text": "Thursday, February 23, 2006\r\n\r\nKenya takes stock of its capacity to fight Aids\r\n\r\nTwo decades of living with HIV and despite\r\nit being declared a national disaster, the\r\ncountry\ufffds hospitals and health centres have\r\nbarely the basics to combat the pandemic.\r\nOf 440 health facilities, sampled in a countrywide\r\nsurvey, more than half do not have running water\r\nor soap for washing hands.\r\nBecause of the danger of HIV infection from contaminated\r\nblood and other body fluids it is a\r\nrequirement that health facilities have within reach\r\na chlorine based moisture for decontaminating used\r\nequipment\ufffd but only three outlets in a hundred\r\nwere found to be stocking the solution.\r\nThe Kenya Service Provision Assessment Survey\r\n2004 (HIV/Aids) was carried out by the National\r\nCoordinating Agency for Population and Development\r\nand the Ministry of Health with technical\r\nassistance from a US firm ORC Marco.\r\nThe study was assessing the country\ufffds capacity to\r\nprovide basic and advanced level services for dealing\r\nwith HIV/Aids in line with WHO developed\r\nindicators. \ufffdWe also wanted to assess the level of\r\nrecord-keeping, capacity to prevent mother-to-child\r\ntransmission and the availability of youth friendly\r\nservices,\ufffd explained Dr Richard Muga, the CEO of\r\nthe coordinating agency.\r\nThe returns posted by the study painted a very worrying\r\nscenario, for example, although other studies\r\nindicate that the youth are at the greatest risk of\r\nacquiring the virus, health facilities that make this\r\ngroup welcome are very few. Only five per cent of\r\nall facilities were found to have youth friendly services\r\nand non-in whole provinces, a case in point\r\nbeing Central.\r\nOnly 37 per cent of facilities do HIV tests across\r\nthe country with anti-retroviral being provided at\r\nonly seven out of a 100 outlets but in half of all hospitals.\r\nThe study, funded by USAid, DfID and Unicef, the\r\nsuggests\ufffdalthough it did not set out to find\r\nwhether so\ufffd that HIV testing in some facilities\r\ncould be going on without the informed consent of\r\nthe clients or that the informed consent is not being\r\nproperly recorded.\r\nIt is a requirement that the test must be provided\r\nonly after an informed consent has been received\r\nfrom the client. The client must be assured that the\r\nresults are confidential. But when sampled, only\r\nabout 15 per cent of maternities and nursing homes,\r\nfor example, were found to have a written informed\r\nconsent policy while the national average was just\r\nabout half of the facilities.\r\nAlthough there is a strong indication that most of\r\nthe facilities can provide the recommended TB"}
