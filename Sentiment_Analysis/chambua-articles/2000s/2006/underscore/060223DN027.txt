This is a\r\nvery important component in the management of\r\nHIV/Aids.\r\nThere is a strong indication that most of the facilities\r\nhave the required guidelines and protocols for\r\nproviding antiretroviral therapy. Surprisingly services\r\nfor caring for people with aids, and treating\r\nopportunistic infections are least among private\r\nprofit making facilities.\r\nEven among outlets offering antiretroviral about 40\r\nper cent had stock outs indicating a worrying trend\r\nwhereby patients may not be getting the\r\nrequired drugs.\r\n\ufffdConsidering that ARTs are a whole new phenomenon\r\nand changing at a very first pace, the\r\nrequirement for trained staff cannot be gainsaid,\r\nbut we were disappointed to find this was\r\nnot the case,\ufffd says Dr Muga.\r\nInvestigators find guidelines\r\nWhile the national average indicate that half\r\nof the facilities have at least somebody trained\r\nin the adherence of ARVs, private for profit\r\nfacilities were found the weakest with regard\r\nto having a trained personnel in this regard.\r\nNot in any one of the 440 facilities did the\r\ninvestigators find guidelines on what is called\r\nPEP or Post-exposure Prophylaxis \ufffd\r\ntreatment for people who are exposed to the\r\nvirus inadvertently e.g. rape victims or health\r\nproviders who may be pricked by sharp\r\nobjects.\r\nDaily Nation/ Thursday, February 23, 2006 27\r\n.
