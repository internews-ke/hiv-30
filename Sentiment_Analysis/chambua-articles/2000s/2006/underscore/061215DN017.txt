{"text": "DAILY NATION\r\nFriday December 15, 2006\r\n\r\nnew study shows\r\nChallenge is\r\nto make the\r\ncut affordable\r\now that it has\r\nbeen shown that\r\ncircumcision can\r\nreduce the risk of\r\ncontracting Aids,\r\nthe next challenge involves\r\nraising the money and the\r\nmedical personnel needed to\r\nconduct millions of circumcisions\r\nevery year.\r\nEach procedure can cost\r\nanywhere between Sh300 to\r\nSh2,000 depending on the\r\nhealth facility. Of concern\r\nalso would be the fact that\r\nconducting the procedure in\r\nnon-hospital situations\r\ncould actually lead to the\r\nspread of HIV and other\r\nblood-borne diseases\r\nthrough contaminated\r\ninstruments.\r\nBut according to researchers,\r\nthe greatest challenge\r\nlies in educating people that\r\ncircumcision is not a silver\r\nbullet against HIV. This\r\nmessage will especially be\r\ncritical for newly circumcised\r\nmen who run the danger\r\nof engaging in risky sexual\r\nbehaviour under the\r\nillusion that they are protected\r\nagainst infection.\r\nAccording to researchers,\r\ncircumcision should only be\r\npart of a broader HIV prevention\r\nstrategy that\r\nincludes limiting the\r\nnumber of sexual partners\r\nand using condoms during\r\nintercourse.\r\nThose involved in the\r\nstudies have cautioned that\r\nthe use of circumcision is\r\nitself fraught with risk and\r\ncontroversy. For one, circumcision\r\nis not universally\r\nculturally accepted. In Kenya,\r\nsome communities practice\r\nit while others do not.\r\nAnd Dr Mark Dybul, executive\r\ndirector of President\r\nBush\ufffds Sh1 trillion ($15 billion)\r\nEmergency Plan for\r\nAids Relief, said in a statement\r\nthat his agency \ufffdwill\r\nsupport implementation of\r\nsafe, medical male circumcision\r\nfor HIV/Aids prevention\ufffd\r\nif world health agencies\r\nrecommend it.\r\nHe also warned that it\r\nwas only one new weapon in\r\nthe fight, adding: \ufffdPrevention\r\nefforts must reinforce\r\nthe ABC approach \ufffd\r\nabstain, be faithful and correct\r\nand consistent use of\r\ncondoms.\ufffd\r\nResearchers have long\r\nnoted that parts of Africa\r\nwhere circumcision is common\r\n\ufffd particularly the Muslim\r\ncountries of West Africa\r\n\ufffd have much lower Aids\r\nrates, while those in southern\r\nAfrica, where circumcision\r\nis rare, have the\r\nhighest. Outside Muslim\r\nregions, circumcision is\r\nspotty.\r\nIn South Africa, for example,\r\nthe Xhosa people circumcise\r\nteenage boys, while\r\nZulus do not. Aids is common\r\nin both tribes.\r\nFormer South African\r\npresident Nelson Mandela\ufffds\r\nautobiography, Long Walk\r\nto Freedom, contains an\r\nunnerving but hilarious\r\naccount of his own Xhosa\r\ncircumcision, by spear blade,\r\nas a teenager. Although he\r\nwas supposed to shout: \ufffdI\r\nam a man!\ufffd he grimaced in\r\npain, he wrote.\r\nBut not all initiation ceremonies\r\nare laughing matters.\r\nEvery year, some South\r\nAfrican teenagers die from\r\ninfections, and the use of\r\none blade on many young\r\nmen may help spread Aids."}
