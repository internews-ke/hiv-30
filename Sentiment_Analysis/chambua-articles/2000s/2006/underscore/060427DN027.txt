{"text": "Daily Nation/ Thursday, April 27, 2006\r\nAIDS Solution Funder Soon\r\n\r\nLocal workplace HIV/Aids management is expected to\r\npositively and drastically change courtesy of Metropolitan Life\r\nKenya. A local subsidiary of Metropolitan of South Africa, the\r\ninsurance firm is set to launch AIDS Solution Funder next\r\nmonth (May), to help workers living with HIV live longer.\r\nThe product, to be introduced in Kenya for the first time ever, will\r\nensure that HIV positive employees remain in active employment as\r\nproductive workers through proper health management. It will also\r\nhelp the independent professional disease management company or\r\nmedical solutions provider, implement\r\neffective strategies to prevent new\r\ninfections.\r\nAccording to Metropolitan Life Kenya chief\r\nexecutive Mr. Linus Makhulo, the firm is\r\ncurrently looking for a suitable medical\r\nprovider who will undertake the disease\r\nmanagement programme.\r\nThe HIV/Aids product is borrowed from a\r\nSouthern Africa model developed by\r\nMetropolitan Group Chief Executive Director,\r\nMr. Peter Doyle. In deciding to introduce this\r\nconcept in Kenya, the insurance firm was\r\nencouraged by Kenya\ufffds lower HIV/Aids\r\nprevalence rate compared to most southern\r\nAfrica countries.\r\nExplains Mr. Makhulo: \ufffdPeter Doyle came up with a model to\r\npredict HIV spread in South Africa and from this it was possible to\r\nwork out estimated cost of benefits while considering use of\r\nanti-retrovirals, counselling among other disease management tools\r\nthat now enable people to live for 20 years or more with the\r\ninfection.\ufffd\r\nPioneers in the provision of risk solutions to those affected by the\r\npandemic, Metropolitan Life was the first life insurer in South Africa\r\nto classify Aids as a dreaded disease and, in 1996, the first company\r\nworldwide to offer life cover to HIV positive people.\r\n\ufffdThe product is a success in southern Africa and so we feel\r\nconfident that we can do even better in Kenya which has a\r\ncomparatively lower HIV risk,\ufffd says the Metropolitan chief."}
