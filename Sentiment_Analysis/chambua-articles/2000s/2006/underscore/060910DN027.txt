{"text": "Sunday Nation/ September 10, 2006\r\nLife\ufffds hard; then you become a refugee\r\n\r\nThabo Mbeki\ufffds policy on\r\nHIV/Aids once again came under\r\neven more scrutiny when more\r\nthan 130 HIV positive South\r\nAfrican women sought asylum in\r\nCanada after last month\ufffds UN\r\nAids conference.\r\nThe women were part of a larger group that\r\nincluded conference participants from El Salvador,\r\nEritrea, Uganda and Zimbabwe who refused\r\nto return home and decided to take their chances\r\nwith Canada, which rejects at least a half of all\r\nasylum applications.\r\nThe South Africans blamed their decision on the\r\nMbeki government\ufffds ambiguity on the causes and\r\ntreatment regimes for the killer disease with most\r\narguing that they could not be guaranteed access\r\nto anti-retroviral medicine which could prolong\r\ntheir lives. Other asylum seekers said they were\r\nfed up with the stigma attached to their seropositive\r\nstatus, while some feared discrimination\r\nand physical abuse because of their sexual orientation.\r\nKeeping the flame of hope\r\nClearly, this year\ufffds theme for World Refugee\r\nDay on June 20, \ufffdKeeping the Flame of Hope\ufffd\ufffd,\r\njust didn\ufffdt do it for these would-be asylum seekers.\r\nThat they are voluntarily choosing a life in\r\nexile is not that surprising either; and not a decision\r\nthey could have taken lightly. Truth is that\r\nthe life of a refugee is not that simple.\r\nThe South African government can\ufffdt, for example,\r\nclaim that it\ufffds keen on using science to tackle\r\nHIV/Aids, with Health minister Manto\r\nTshabalala-Msimang instead suggesting (with no\r\ntongue-in-cheek) that a concoction of beetroot,\r\ngarlic and lemon was an effective anti-dote\r\nagainst the advance of full-blown Aids. South\r\nAfrican media have since derisively dubbed her\r\n\ufffdDr Beetroot\ufffd\ufffd. So Dr Tshabalala-Msimang\ufffds 130\r\ncountrywomen appear to be the lucky ones. But\r\nthey were lucky because many are probably educated\r\nand could either afford tickets to Toronto, or\r\nwere able to sweet-talk someone with deep pockets\r\nand a big heart in flying them out. There are millions\r\nof South Africans who\ufffdre not so lucky. The\r\nSouth African Medical Research Council estimates\r\nthat there are around 5.5 million South Africans\r\nwho are infected, the world\ufffds second highest total\r\nafter India\ufffds. Two recent council reports also estimated\r\nthat 947 South Africans die from Aidsrelated\r\nillnesses daily, 1,443 become newly infected\r\nevery day, and put the death toll over the last 12\r\nmonths at 330,000. Meanwhile, only 200,000 of the\r\n5.5 million infected are on anti-retroviral drugs.\r\nWho can blame someone from fleeing such purgatory?\r\nBut, as bad as the situation is in South Africa\ufffds\r\nheath sector, there are some people whose plight\r\nalways seems to be a lot worse. Somali refugees in\r\nSouth Africa, for instance, live in fear in the Western\r\nCape, after a series of attacks this year, that\r\npolice blame on xenophobia which have left\r\nbetween 29 and 150 people \ufffd depending on who\r\nyou believe \ufffd dead. Refugees are often vulnerable\r\nto attacks because they tend to congregate in one\r\nplace (to create the illusion of safety in numbers).\r\nThey\ufffdve also tended to prosper more than many\r\nlocals because they have no choice. They save more,\r\neat less, work harder, etc. Ironically this good fortune\r\nmight explain why they become targets of\r\nlocals (as Somalis have become in South Africa)\r\nwho are often unwilling, or unable to distinguish\r\ntheir own misery from the bulging coffers of \ufffdthese\r\nforeigners\ufffd. Somali refugees have been accused of\r\nwitchcraft, spitting in public (oh yeah!), having links\r\nto terrorism, stealing South African women, and anything\r\nelse that can conceivably be framed as a crime.\r\nAnd it\ufffds not just Somalis. Anyone who has ever been\r\na refugee or had relatives in this predicament knows\r\njust how tough life is abroad. Neighbours are reflexively\r\nsuspicious, and since 9-11, it\ufffds unfashionable to\r\nwear the burkha, have an olive skin, sport a long\r\nbeard or be originally from any country with majority\r\nArab or Muslim populations. Innocent people who\r\nfled repression in their own countries have been targeted\r\nby angry locals in many Western countries,\r\nincluding the most tolerant (Sweden, Denmark and\r\nHolland). Victims often have nothing to do but sit\r\nout the crises because a return home is an automatic\r\ndeath sentence, while police in their adopted countries\r\noften take sides against them.\r\nOften, refugees would much rather be home. In the\r\nOld Testament, the Jews (led by Moses) wandered\r\nthe Sinai desert for 40 years, as they looked for the\r\nway back to Canaan. When Israel was finally\r\nfounded in 1948, it unleashed one of the largest refugee\r\npopulations, as Palestinians fled to Jordan, Egypt\r\nand elsewhere. They are still waiting to return home.\r\nThe Kurds in northern Iraq, southern Turkey, Germany\r\nand Syria want a country of their own; while\r\nthe Dalai Lama and many of his people have lived in\r\nexile in India since 1959, when China effectively\r\nannexed Tibet. Uganda and Tanzania had a large\r\npopulation of Rwandese \ufffd mainly Tutsi \ufffd refugees\r\nwho stayed in camps and rural outposts for almost a\r\ngeneration before they made a break for it behind\r\nthe Rwandese Patriotic Army (RPA) rebellion in\r\n1990. Sadly, that civil war eventually culminated in\r\nthe 1994 genocide in which up to 1 million people\r\ndied. The RPA\ufffds military victory itself unleashed\r\nanother refugee exodus to Congo, of up to 2 million\r\nmainly Hutu Rwandese who were afraid of\r\nreprisal killings. To this day, some of those men,\r\nwomen and children still wander the unforgivable\r\njungles of the Congo.\r\nRefugee status is not limited to those who manage\r\nto become Diasporic by fleeing to Europe or\r\nNorth America. Uganda has had a large internally\r\ndisplaced population for almost 20 years. Many\r\nhave known nothing but a life in camps set up by\r\nthe government, apparently to protect them from\r\nattacks by the Lord\ufffds Resistance Army of Joseph\r\nKony. Several studies have called the conflict in\r\nnorthern Uganda one of the most insidious in\r\nrecent world history because it\ufffds taken place right\r\nunder the noses of those who claim to care. The\r\nconflict in neighbouring Darfur region (in Sudan)\r\nis similar.\r\nRefugees in our midst\r\nIt is so easy to forget the refugees in our midst\r\n(whether in Kampala or Nairobi); and perhaps\r\nlocals can\ufffdt do much because they are often as\r\npoor and as helpless. But governments have a\r\nresponsibility to treat foreigners with some dignity\r\nand to come to their rescue when they become\r\nvictims of xenophobic attacks. It was perhaps a\r\nsign of the times, but there were instances in the\r\nlate 1980s when Kenyan authorities used to round\r\nup the hundreds of Ugandans living in Nairobi\r\nand throw them in jail. They were often just\r\npawns in the political games between Presidents\r\nYoweri Museveni and Daniel arap Moi. Fortunately,\r\nEast Africans are now often more likely to\r\nbe traders and professionals in each other\ufffds capitals\r\nthan refugees.\r\nNow, if only South Africans can be more accepting\r\nof Somali refugees, who don\ufffdt even have a\r\nfunctional government back home.\r\nskyazze@hotmail.com"}
