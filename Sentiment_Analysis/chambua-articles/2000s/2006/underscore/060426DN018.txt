{"text": "Daily Nation/ Wednesday, April 26, 2006\r\nElder: Immorality fuels spread of Aids\r\n\r\nBy NATION Correspondents\r\nThe spread of Aids in Nyanza\r\nProvince is due to mmorality,\r\nthe chairman of the Luo Council\r\nof Elders, Mr Meshack Ogalo,\r\nhas said.\r\nMr Ogalo disagreed with those who\r\nblamed polygamy for the spread of the\r\ndisease.\r\nHe said yesterday at a workshop on\r\nwomen, property and inheritance rights\r\nin Nakuru Town: \ufffdImmorality is a major\r\ncause of HIV infections in Nyanza and\r\nother parts of the country. Polygamy is\r\nnot the problem.\ufffd\r\nThe high rate of HIV infections had led\r\nto an increase in the number of young\r\nwidows in the province, he added.\r\nThe workshop also heard that immoral\r\nbehaviour on the shores of Lake Victoria\r\nwas a setback in the fight against the\r\ndisease.\r\nMany young and educated Luos were\r\nshunning polygamy although it was still\r\nwidely practised in their community, the\r\nparticipants were told.\r\nMore than one wife\r\nDue to the hard economic times, many\r\npeople in the community were not keen\r\non having more than one wife.\r\nSaid Mrs Phoebe Asiyo, a former MP:\r\n\ufffdPolygamy is dying in this community\r\nbecause young people are shunning the\r\npractice as it was just for prestige in the\r\nolden days.\ufffd\r\nMrs Asiyo said high poverty and illiteracy\r\nlevels, especially along the shores of\r\nLake Victoria, were to blame for the\r\nspread of the disease.\r\n\ufffdWe have started educating fishermen\r\non the dangers they expose themselves\r\nto by being immoral,\ufffd she said.\r\nA lean workforce is to blame for the\r\ncongestion and poor services in public\r\nhospitals, the Kenya Clinical Officers\r\nAssociation has said.\r\nIt said poor pay for health workers contributed\r\na lot to the shortage of staff in\r\nsuch hospitals.\r\nThe association\ufffds officials also threatened\r\nto call a strike if their quest for a\r\npay rise and demands for hiring of more\r\nhealth staff were not fulfilled by June.\r\n\ufffdThere is need for the Government to\r\nemploy more clinical officers and award\r\nthem a salary increase if it is really\r\ncommitted to improving health care,\ufffd\r\nsaid the association\ufffds national chairman,\r\nMr Japheth Mutangili. He spoke\r\nto the Nation in Nyahururu Town.\r\nBut he was optimistic that the ongoing\r\nconsultations between the association\r\nand the Health ministry would bear\r\nfruit.\r\nBoost morale\r\nThis, he said, would boost the morale\r\nof clinicians who had been denied a\r\npay rise for a long time yet they played\r\ncrucial roles in providing medical care.\r\nMr Mutangili was accompanied by the\r\nassociation\ufffds national secretary general,\r\nMr Japheth Akwabi, and the local\r\nchapter chairman, Mr Irungu Kamau."}
