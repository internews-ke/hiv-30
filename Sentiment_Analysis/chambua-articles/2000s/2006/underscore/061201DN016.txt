Malnutrition and lack of\r\nfood heighten susceptibility to HIV exposure\r\nand infection, while Aids in turn exacerbates\r\nhunger,\ufffd says Dr Gillespie.\r\nWhen people are short of food, they may\r\nbe forced to separate from their families to\r\nearn a livelihood. Migrant workers are at\r\nthe heightened risk of HIV exposure and\r\ninfection, and may spread the virus when\r\nthey return home. Poor women may trade\r\nsex to feed their families. They may also be\r\nless able to access information about the\r\ndisease or less able to act on their knowledge\r\nof risk to minimise HIV exposure.\r\nLack of proper nutrition may lead to\r\nincreased HIV transmission efficiency by\r\nlowering immunity and compromising the\r\nstrength of stomach and genital lining.\r\nMalnutrition among pregnant and breastfeeding\r\nwomen may increase the chances\r\nof infecting their babies.\r\nIn addition, reduced food intake and\r\nfood quality hasten the progression to fullblown\r\nAids among people already infected\r\nwith HIV. Studies show that weight loss of\r\nfive per cent over a period of four months,\r\nfor example, leads to opportunistic infections\r\nand increased risk of death. Infections\r\nare longer-lasting and more severe in\r\nsomeone who is malnourished. They may\r\nalso be more frequent.\r\nFood an important weapon\r\nAccording to Dr Gillespie, links between\r\nHIV/Aids and hunger are particularly\r\nacute in rural communities, where households\r\nare often dependent on agriculture\r\nfor both income and food. Improving rural\r\nlivelihoods and agricultural production\r\ncan help reduce both the spread of HIV\r\nand the effects of Aids. He says that programmes\r\nthat reduce the need for poor\r\npeople to migrate to look for work, for\r\nexample by restoring degraded land, can\r\nalso reduce their risk of being exposed to\r\nthe virus.\r\nAs evidence of the interactions between\r\nAids and hunger has accumulated, both\r\nagriculture and nutrition specialists have\r\nbegun to take Aids into account. In turn,\r\nAids experts have become increasingly\r\naware of the critical importance of nutrition,\r\nparticularly if anti-retroviral drugs\r\n(ARVs) are to be effective.\r\nA recent study shows that if patients are\r\nmalnourished when they start ARV therapy\r\nthey are six times more likely to die\r\nthan well-nourished patients.\r\nThey are also more likely to suffer sideeffects,\r\nwhich may cause them to stop taking\r\nthe ARVs altogether. And if many people\r\nstop, drug resistance will spread fast.\r\nMalnutrition also increases the chances\r\nof disease transmission between adults.\r\nFor example, Vitamin A deficiency is particularly\r\nassociated with an increased risk\r\nof STDs, including genital ulcers and cervical\r\nherpes simplex virus shedding, which\r\nincrease the risk of HIV transmission.\r\nFocusing on the single premise that high\r\nrates of HIV prevalence in Africa are\r\nmainly due to high levels of unprotected,\r\nnon-monogamous sex has restricted policy\r\ninterventions. Hence, prevention of HIV is\r\npursued predominantly through initiatives\r\nto \ufffdchange behaviour\ufffd, such as the ABC\r\napproach (Abstain, Be faithful, and use a\r\nCondom). Several studies stress the need\r\nto look beyond proximal factors of highrisk\r\nbehaviour in HIV transmission. There\r\nis need to investigate why people engage\r\nin high-risk behaviour to successfully\r\naddress the crisis.\r\nMoreover, the use of the term \ufffdpandemic\ufffd\r\nconceals the fact that multiple epidemics\r\nmay differ in causation, velocity, duration,\r\nand impact."}
