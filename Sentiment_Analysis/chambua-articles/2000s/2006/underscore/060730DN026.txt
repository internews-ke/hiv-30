{"text": "Use of ICT lowers\r\ncost of managing\r\nmedical records\r\n\r\nBy SAM WAMBUGU\r\nQuite often when it comes to\r\nKenya's health system, the\r\ninfrastructure to support\r\nand sustain information technology\r\nsystems is not available on a\r\nregular basis, including regular\r\nelectricity supply, and workers\r\nskilled in computer use.\r\nLow power battery operated\r\ndevices such as hand-held can be\r\nused where reliable electrical\r\npower is not available.\r\nIn addition devices that can\r\nstore and forward information can\r\nbe used when regular connectivity\r\nis not available. Import duties on\r\nsolar equipment and accessories\r\nhave been removed, including\r\ndeep cycle and sealed batteries\r\nspecifically for solar power,\r\nthrowing a life-line to areas where\r\nelectricity is still foreign.\r\nICT tools can improve the performance\r\nof the health care service\r\ndelivery by providing quality\r\ninformation in a timely manner to\r\nproviders, policy makers and the\r\ndonor community. It allows health\r\ncare providers to collect, store,\r\nretrieve and transfer information\r\nelectronically.\r\nIt can also improve the timeliness\r\nof data by reducing the\r\namount of data processing necessary\r\nthrough automation, and the\r\nspeed at which data is reported to\r\nhigher levels through electronic\r\ndata transfer. Put together, this\r\nmay determine death or survival\r\nof a patient.\r\nAdditionally, ICT tools can aid\r\nin the collection of data at the\r\npoint of care, thereby reducing the\r\nuse of fault-prone paper-based\r\nsystems. This is already in use in\r\nsome high volume\r\nhealth facilities\r\nand facilities\r\nsupported by religious\r\norganizations\r\nand nongove\r\nr n m e n t a l\r\norganizations in\r\nKenya.\r\nE l e c t r o n i c\r\nmedical records\r\n(EMR), handheld\r\ndevices and\r\ntelemedicine can\r\naid providers in\r\nmanaging their\r\npatient care by\r\nproviding decision support in the\r\nform of on-hand medical histories;\r\ndrug formularies, dosages,\r\nand drug-to-drug interactions; and\r\npeer-to-peer consultations.\r\nThere are multiple units within\r\nthe hospital that capture different\r\ndata. Healthcare workers can use\r\nclinical information for diagnostic\r\nand treatment purposes. Hospital\r\nadministrators are monitoring\r\nsuch aspects as patient flow, the\r\nneed for supplies, and financial\r\noperations of the facility. Other\r\nstaff may be focused on the\r\nreporting of population health statistics\r\nwithin and across hospital\r\nfacilities.\r\nThis more complex array of\r\ndata needs at the hospital level\r\nincreases the opportunities for\r\nICT to be applied. At the community\r\nlevel, health information\r\nhas a bounty of benefits, including\r\nproviding data for decision making,\r\nproblem solving, planning\r\nand resource tracking. For example,\r\ncare for orphans and children\r\nmade vulnerable by HIV/Aids is\r\nby its very nature community and\r\nideally home-based.\r\nIt is general knowledge that the\r\nmost successful and effective care\r\nis dependent upon the identification\r\nof a potentially vulnerable\r\nchild, providing a medical and\r\nsocial care plan before they are\r\norphaned, and continued afterward,\r\ncoupled with long term follow-\r\nup that emphasizes preventing\r\nthe child from drifting to the\r\nstreet.\r\nThe only way to do this successfully\r\nis by employing an\r\nactive and competent electronic\r\ninformation system that includes\r\nsurveillance of the needs of the\r\nchildren in the community.\r\nEarly identification of potentially\r\nvulnerable children is\r\ntremendously enhanced when\r\nsuch a system is connected to HIV\r\ndiagnostic and treatment programmes,\r\nsuch as counselling and\r\ntesting, and home-based care\r\nservices.\r\nIn order for such a linkage\r\nbetween children and HIV/Aids\r\ntreatment to be successful, respective\r\ninformation systems must be\r\ncompetent. Clinicians at health\r\nfacilities providing HIV/Aids care\r\nrely on information that must be\r\naccurate and reliable to ensure\r\neffective patient management.\r\nIt is critical that treatment regimens\r\nare followed to reduce the\r\nlikelihood of individuals developing\r\nresistance to drugs, or worse\r\nyet, the emergence of\r\na new drug-resistant\r\nstrain of HIV. Clinical\r\nknowledge and treatment\r\nmanagement\r\nmust work with tools\r\nto provide an opportunity\r\nfor evidencebased\r\nmedicine: a\r\nrobust health management\r\ninformation system\r\nis one of the tools.\r\nMaintaining antiretroviral\r\ntherapy\r\n(ART) records\r\ninvolves having\r\ndetailed medical\r\nrecords available at points of care.\r\nTraditionally, this has been done\r\nwith a paper record stored at the\r\nclinic, or carried by the patient.\r\nHowever, there are advantages to\r\nhaving the information electronically\r\nsince it can be retrieved\r\nmore easily, and the computer\r\nprogrammes can provide intelligent\r\nanalysis and treatment\r\nadvice.\r\nStake holders in the health\r\nindustry must champion the establishment\r\nof sound systems for collecting,\r\nstoring and analysing\r\nmedical information electronically.\r\nThe writer is a Monitoring and\r\nEvaluation specialist for Family\r\nHealth International (FHI):\r\nsamwambugu@yahoo.com"}
