{"text": "Daily Nation/Thursday, April 6, 2006\r\nFresh drive\r\nunderway\r\nto replenish\r\nblood bank\r\n\r\nBy Peter Ngare\r\nAserious accident has\r\nhappened along the\r\nb u s y N a i r o b i -\r\nMombasa road and\r\nvictims are taken to a nearby\r\ndistrict hospital.\r\nThe casualties are bleeding\r\nprofusely and 15 need immediate\r\nblood transfusion. But there\r\nis only enough in the hospital\ufffds\r\nblood bank for four people.\r\nData from Bloodlink\r\nFoundation indicates\r\nthat three people\r\nin Kenya require\r\nblood every 10 minutes.\r\nBlood is not just\r\nneeded for emergency\r\nsituations. Hospitals\r\nalso depend on donations\r\ndaily for routine\r\nprocedures and operations.\r\nThe shortfall\r\nin safe blood to\r\nmeet transfusion\r\nneeds in the country\r\nhas increased\r\nfrom 60,000 in the mid-nineties\r\nto 100,000 now, according to Mr\r\nJoseph Wang\ufffdendo of Bloodlink\r\nFoundation.\r\nThe shrinking national constituency\r\nof willing donors\r\ncomes in the wake of an increasing\r\ndemand for blood that presently\r\nstands at 200,000 units a\r\nyear.\r\nThis can be attributed to\r\nissues related to the advent of\r\nHIV. \ufffdDonors are reluctant to\r\ndonate blood due to fears of\r\ntheir HIV status being known to\r\nthemselves or others,\ufffd says Mr\r\nWang\ufffdendo. \ufffdCoupled with this\r\nis the fear of unsterilised needles.\ufffd\r\nThe alarming\r\ndecline in donations\r\naccounts for\r\n30 per cent of\r\ndeaths that can be\r\nsaved if there was\r\nsufficient blood\r\nfor transfusion.\r\nThe concern\r\nover the declining\r\nnumber of donors\r\nhas prompted a\r\nnew initiative that\r\nseeks to increase\r\nthe number of Kenyans donating\r\nblood on regular basis.\r\nThe nationwide blood donation\r\ncampaign, dubbed Safaricom\r\n\ufffdBlood for Life Drive\ufffd,\r\nseeks to address the perennial\r\nshortage.\r\nThe drive, launched earlier in\r\nthe year, is also supported by\r\nthe National Blood Transfusion\r\nService and Bloodlink Foundation.\r\nIt hopes to raise 10,000\r\nunits of blood by December.\r\nThere was a high turnout of\r\ndonors during the launch at the\r\nKenyatta International Conference\r\nCentre and there are hopes\r\nthat the pace set in Nairobi will\r\nbe replicated countrywide, starting\r\nwith Kisumu this week.\r\nThe initiative targets the\r\nworkforce in the corporate\r\nworld, hoping to convince them\r\nof the importance of donating\r\nblood on a regular basis.\r\n\ufffdA recruitment programme\r\nbased upon voluntary\r\nnon-remunerated blood donation\r\nis the best way for covering\r\nt h e d e f i c i t , \ufffd s a y s M r\r\nWang\ufffdendo. \ufffdThe success of\r\nsuch a programme must rest on\r\na client-oriented approach that\r\nfosters a spirit of benevolence\r\nand volunteerism, and also\r\nenjoys public confidence.\ufffd\r\nThis will hopefully reverse\r\nthe current practice in which\r\nolder people only turn out to\r\ndonate blood for replacement\r\nafter a relative or a\r\nfriend has received\r\nblood in hospital.\r\nThe national blood\r\nbank relies heavily on\r\nsecondary school students,\r\nwho account for\r\n60 percent of donations.\r\nDuring school vacations,\r\nMr Wang\ufffdendo\r\nsays, there is a drastic\r\nreduction in the\r\namount of blood\r\ndonated for use in\r\nhealth care institutions.\r\nThis brings out\r\nthe need to develop a pool of\r\ndonors to supplement the secondary\r\nschool students.\r\nThe drive seeks to achieve\r\nthis through educating people\r\non the benefits of knowing\r\none\ufffds HIV status since this is\r\nconsidered as a major hindrances\r\nto blood donation. It\r\nalso endeavours to allay fears\r\nthat people can get HIV/Aids\r\nand other infections in the process\r\nof donating blood.\r\n\ufffdAll needles used during\r\nblood donations are sterile and\r\ndisposable and the chances of\r\ninfection are nil,\ufffd Mr\r\nWang\ufffdendo says.\r\nIn labelling the\r\nblood, the donor\r\nis not identified.\r\nBlood labelling is\r\nbasically sticking\r\nlabels on the\r\nblood bags indicating\r\nthe blood\r\ng r o u p s a n d\r\nstamping the\r\nword \ufffdscreened\ufffd.\r\nBesides grouping,\r\ndonated\r\nblood is screened and tested for\r\nfour major transfusion transmissible\r\ninfections. These are HIV,\r\nHepatitis B, Hepatitis C and\r\nSyphilis.\r\n\ufffdThe results of the screening\r\nprocess are confidential and can\r\nonly be released to the donor\r\nupon request,\ufffd says Mr\r\nWang\ufffdendo. After the blood is\r\nconfirmed to be safe for transfusion,\r\nit is stored in a cold\r\nroom. Infected blood is\r\ndestroyed.\r\nDoctors says that you can\r\ngive blood if you\ufffdre aged 16-65,\r\nare in good health and weigh\r\nover 50 kilogrammes. You can\r\nstill donate blood after 65 if you\r\nare certified medically fit. You\r\ncan safely donate blood every\r\n12 weeks. Adults have between\r\nfive to six litres of blood. The\r\nbody replaces lost fluid within\r\nhours and cellular content in\r\ntwo to three weeks."}
