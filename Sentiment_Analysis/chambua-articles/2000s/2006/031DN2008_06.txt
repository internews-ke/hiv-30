South Africa dismisses criticism on Aids policy

JOHANNESBURG,
Saturday
South Africa today dismissed
harsh criticism of its Aids policy
by a top UN official and said he
was no Messiah for Africa’s
HIV/Aids crisis.
UN special envoy on Aids in
Africa Stephen Lewis closed a
global conference on Friday with
probably the most blistering
attack ever on South Africa’s
“lunatic fringe” approach to
Aids, calling it immoral and
ineffective.
Mr Lewis’ comments, echoed
by other speakers at the Toronto
conference, represented a diplomatic
broadside against President
Thabo Mbeki’s government,
which faces one of the
world’s biggest HIV/Aids
caseloads.
About five million people, or
one in nine South Africans, are
infected.
Health ministry spokesman
Sibani Mngadi issued a statement
today rejecting Mr Lewis’
speech “with contempt”.
“Lewis is not Africa’s Messiah,”
Mr Mngadi said, detailing
South African accomplishments
on Aids including the distribution
of millions of free condoms
and a free drug programme that
now reaches more than 175,000
infected people.
“What Africa needs now is not
unsubstantiated attack on democratically
elected governments,
but delivery on the many resolutions
made with regard to
addressing poverty and underdevelopment
which increases the
vulnerability of our population
to disease,” Mr Mngadi said.
South Africa has long been at
odds with Aids activists and medical
experts over how to deal with
an epidemic which kills more
than 800 people in the country
every day.
Resisted offering drugs
Mr Mbeki’s government first
denied that the HIV virus causes
Aids and then resisted offering
HIV drugs to its people, calling
them expensive and potentially
dangerous.
The government bowed to
public outcry in 2003 and
launched a public antiretroviral
drug programme which officials
now call one of the biggest in the
world. But Health Minister
Manto Tshabalala-Msimang still
questions antiretrovirals and
instead promotes home-grown
remedies such as olive oil, beetroot
and garlic. She says they
boost nutrition and immune
response but activists say her
prescription leads to thousands
of deaths every year.
“It is the only country in
Africa whose government continues
to propound theories
more worthy of a lunatic fringe
than of a concerned and compassionate
state,” Mr Lewis said on
Friday.
Mr Mbeki’s ruling ANC signalled
it had no plans to revise its
strategy issuing a statement on
Friday savaging the Treatment
Action Campaign, South Africa’s
Aids activist group which led
criticism of Tshabalala-Msimang
at the Toronto conference. —
