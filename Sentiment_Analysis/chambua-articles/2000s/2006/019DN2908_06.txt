Elders to lead fight
against HIV/Aids
A community-based organisation
in Kaloleni Division of Kilifi District
has launched a health education
campaign among elders,
or the Kaya. The chairman of the
Community Initiative Health Education
Agency, Mr Harold Kodo,
said yesterday that the surest
way to pass the HIV and Aids
message to the local communities
was through educating the
traditional leaders. He called on
the Government to organise the
workshops.
