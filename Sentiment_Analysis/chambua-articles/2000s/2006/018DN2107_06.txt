Gates donates
Sh20bn to
Aids research

SEATTLE, Thursday
More than 20 years after
scientists began searching
for an HIV vaccine,
the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation
this week announced a
major effort to bring together
researchers from around the
world with a collaborative new
business model.
The foundation announced 16
grants totalling $287 million
(Sh20 billion) over five years to
set up an international network
of HIV vaccine scientists. A third
of the money — five of the grants
— will pay for central laboratories
and data analysis facilities to
test researchers’ findings.
The hope is to more definitively
identify the most effective vaccine
approaches and then direct
future efforts toward those ideas,
said Dr Nicholas Hellmann,
acting director
of the Gates Foundation’s
HIV, TB and
reproductive health
programme.
“Unfortunately, developing
an effective HIV
vaccine has proven to
be tremendously difficult,
and despite the
committed efforts of many
researchers around the world,
progress simply has not been fast
enough,’’ Dr Hellmann said.
The $287 million commitment is
the Gates Foundation’s single
largest investment in the area of
HIV-Aids research. Before this
week’s announcement, the foundation
had already announced
HIV-Aids grants totalling more
than $10 million (Sh730 million)
in 2006. Total grants in this area
in 2005 were more than $53 million
(Sh3.8 billion).
Each of the 165 investigators in
19 countries who are getting
money in this series of grants had
to agree to share their findings in
real time and compare results
with others — even if they had
been working on competing
projects in the past.
Historically, HIV vaccine
research mostly has been conducted
by small research
groups working independently,
said Dr Juliana McElrath, associate
head of the infectious diseases
program at the Fred
Hutchinson Cancer Research
Centre in Seattle and a lead
researcher on one of the new
grants. “While critical progress
has been made, the HIV vaccine
field has lacked a shared,
focused strategy,’’ she said.
Dr McElrath spoke about the
lack of standardised tools to
compare results and ways to
share information quickly. She
noted that research teams usually
decide on their own
whether to pursue a particular
approach and vaccine candidates
from different researchers
are not usually compared.
“As a result, there’s no guarantee
that the best vaccine
candidate will be
the one that is rapidly
advanced
through clinical trials,’’
she said.
Dr Hellmann said
the new level of collaboration
being created
through this
series of grants is
critical to making HIV vaccine
development more efficient,
but he acklowledged that an
effective vaccine may still be 10
years away. The collaborative
approach is a new paradigm in
HIV vaccine research that Dr
Hellmann hopes will move the
process forward as quickly as
possible.
The 11 grants going to research
projects are evenly split
between groups seeking to find
antibodies that will neutralise
HIV, and those researchers trying
to find a way to elicit cellular
immunity. Dr Hellmann
said the ultimate vaccine may
combine both approaches.
Over 40 million people are currently
living with HIV/Aids
around the globe while 25 million
have so far died of causes
related to the scourge. (AP)
