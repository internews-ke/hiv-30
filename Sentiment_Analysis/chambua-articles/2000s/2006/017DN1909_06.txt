Medics blamed
over Aids cases

ASTANA, Monday
Fifty-five small children contracted
HIV through doctors’ negligence in a
southern Kazakh city, the Central
Asian nation’s Health minister said.
All the children were infected while
receiving treatment at the regional
children’s hospital in the city of
Shymkent.
Nearly 5,000 children under three
years, who were treated at the hospital
have been tested since the first cases of
HIV among young children were
reported this summer. “There was
plain negligence, and there were violations
of medical norms,” minister
Erbolat Dosayev said. (AP)
