Appeal to support
victims of Aids
Employers have been asked to
help end discrimination against
people living with HIV at places
of work. A good work environment
would help boost their productivity,
a spokesman for people
living with the virus, Mr
Francis Ruwa, told the International
Candlelight celebrations in
memory of people who have died
of Aids at Mbaraki Club in Mombasa.
Mr Ruwa was recently
declared ambassador of hope.
