Reinsurance
firms asked
to diversify

By NATION Reporter
Reinsurance companies have
been asked to diversify to remain
relevant in the current business
setting.
Sophistication in crime, particularly
insurance fraud, brought
about by change in information
technology called for reinsurance
companies to work closely and
share information to minimise
losses.
The companies,
which take up reinsurance
for all
classes of business,
must be ready to
d i v e r s i f y a n d
embrace change,
while at the same
time retaining their
traditional markets, said Mr
Sammy Makove, the insurance
commissioner.
Mr Makove was speaking at
Nairobi’s Grand Regency Hotel
during a seminar organised by
the African Reinsurance
Corporation.
The corporation is made up of
41 member countries of the African
Union, including all the East
African countries.
Others are the African
Development Bank (ADB) and
more than 100 insurance and
reinsurance companies in Africa.
The company was established
in 1976 by the Organisation of
African Unity and the ADB, to
reduce outflow of foreign
exchange in the form of reinsurance
premium.
At the moment, Africa Reinsurance
Corporation shareholders’
funds stand in excess of Sh12
billion, with a financial base of
Sh21 billion.
M r M a k o v e
asked reinsurance
c o m p a n i e s t o
broaden their base
to attract more
customers.
He talked of the
challenges in the
industry brought by
HIV and Aids and asked for laws
to be put in place to address the
issue.
Said he: “The insurance industry
can no longer afford to ignore
HIV/Aids, and the earlier the
sector comes up with a policy to
address the issue, the better.”
The industry was suffering
from a weak and outdated regulatory
structure that inhibited
growth, said Mr Makove.
