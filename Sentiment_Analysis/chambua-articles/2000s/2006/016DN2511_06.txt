Cases of TB
super bug
reported

JOHANNESBURG, Friday
South Africa has recorded 303
cases of a highly drug-resistant
strain of tuberculosis this year,
raising fears a super bug is
spreading in the Aids-ravaged
country, the health department
was quoted as saying.
South Africa’s health department
did not have details on how
many people had died of XDRTB,
the South African Press
Association reported.
“They are in the hospitals,
they are on treatment. Some of
them have died,” SAPA quoted
the department’s head of TB, Dr
Lindiwe Mvusi, as saying.
Experts say the super bug
could wreak havoc in South Africa,
where one in nine people are
infected with HIV, making them
more vulnerable to TB.
An easily transferred airborne
respiratory disease, tuberculosis
is the main direct cause of death
for people with Aids in South
Africa, and health officials worry
the spread of a highly resistant
strain could complicate the battle
against HIV. (Reuters)
