Fresh drive
underway
to replenish
blood bank

By Peter Ngare
Aserious accident has
happened along the
b u s y N a i r o b i -
Mombasa road and
victims are taken to a nearby
district hospital.
The casualties are bleeding
profusely and 15 need immediate
blood transfusion. But there
is only enough in the hospital’s
blood bank for four people.
Data from Bloodlink
Foundation indicates
that three people
in Kenya require
blood every 10 minutes.
Blood is not just
needed for emergency
situations. Hospitals
also depend on donations
daily for routine
procedures and operations.
The shortfall
in safe blood to
meet transfusion
needs in the country
has increased
from 60,000 in the mid-nineties
to 100,000 now, according to Mr
Joseph Wang’endo of Bloodlink
Foundation.
The shrinking national constituency
of willing donors
comes in the wake of an increasing
demand for blood that presently
stands at 200,000 units a
year.
This can be attributed to
issues related to the advent of
HIV. “Donors are reluctant to
donate blood due to fears of
their HIV status being known to
themselves or others,” says Mr
Wang’endo. “Coupled with this
is the fear of unsterilised needles.”
The alarming
decline in donations
accounts for
30 per cent of
deaths that can be
saved if there was
sufficient blood
for transfusion.
The concern
over the declining
number of donors
has prompted a
new initiative that
seeks to increase
the number of Kenyans donating
blood on regular basis.
The nationwide blood donation
campaign, dubbed Safaricom
“Blood for Life Drive”,
seeks to address the perennial
shortage.
The drive, launched earlier in
the year, is also supported by
the National Blood Transfusion
Service and Bloodlink Foundation.
It hopes to raise 10,000
units of blood by December.
There was a high turnout of
donors during the launch at the
Kenyatta International Conference
Centre and there are hopes
that the pace set in Nairobi will
be replicated countrywide, starting
with Kisumu this week.
The initiative targets the
workforce in the corporate
world, hoping to convince them
of the importance of donating
blood on a regular basis.
“A recruitment programme
based upon voluntary
non-remunerated blood donation
is the best way for covering
t h e d e f i c i t , ” s a y s M r
Wang’endo. “The success of
such a programme must rest on
a client-oriented approach that
fosters a spirit of benevolence
and volunteerism, and also
enjoys public confidence.”
This will hopefully reverse
the current practice in which
older people only turn out to
donate blood for replacement
after a relative or a
friend has received
blood in hospital.
The national blood
bank relies heavily on
secondary school students,
who account for
60 percent of donations.
During school vacations,
Mr Wang’endo
says, there is a drastic
reduction in the
amount of blood
donated for use in
health care institutions.
This brings out
the need to develop a pool of
donors to supplement the secondary
school students.
The drive seeks to achieve
this through educating people
on the benefits of knowing
one’s HIV status since this is
considered as a major hindrances
to blood donation. It
also endeavours to allay fears
that people can get HIV/Aids
and other infections in the process
of donating blood.
“All needles used during
blood donations are sterile and
disposable and the chances of
infection are nil,” Mr
Wang’endo says.
In labelling the
blood, the donor
is not identified.
Blood labelling is
basically sticking
labels on the
blood bags indicating
the blood
g r o u p s a n d
stamping the
word ‘screened’.
Besides grouping,
donated
blood is screened and tested for
four major transfusion transmissible
infections. These are HIV,
Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and
Syphilis.
“The results of the screening
process are confidential and can
only be released to the donor
upon request,” says Mr
Wang’endo. After the blood is
confirmed to be safe for transfusion,
it is stored in a cold
room. Infected blood is
destroyed.
Doctors says that you can
give blood if you’re aged 16-65,
are in good health and weigh
over 50 kilogrammes. You can
still donate blood after 65 if you
are certified medically fit. You
can safely donate blood every
12 weeks. Adults have between
five to six litres of blood. The
body replaces lost fluid within
hours and cellular content in
two to three weeks.
