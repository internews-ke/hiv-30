New scientific
evidence in Libyan
HIV case

LONDON, Wednesday
Scientists have produced new
evidence that casts doubts on
charges against five Bulgarian
nurses and a Palestinian
doctor accused of deliberately
infecting 426 Libyan children
with HIV in 1998.
The trial of the six health
workers ended in Tripoli last
month. The prosecutor
demanded the death penalty
after five Libyan HIV/Aids
experts stood by their 61-page
report written in 2003 that
found the infections resulted
from an intentional act.
A Libyan court is expected
to deliver a verdict on
December 19.
But a team of international
scientists who reconstructed
the history of the virus from
samples from the children
have shown the subtype of
HIV began infecting patients
at the Al-Fateh Hospital in
Benghazi before the foreign
medical team arrived.
“The evidence shows the
chain of infection started a
few years before the arrival
of the foreign staff accused
of causing it deliberately,”
Dr Tulio de Oliveira, a
molecular virologist at
Oxford University in England,
said in an interview.
The scientists, whose
findings are published
online by the journal
Nature, analysed the genetic
code of HIV and Hepatitis C
viruses from the children to
determine when the outbreaks
started. They did an
extensive analysis using 20
different models.
“All of them give a date
for the start of the epidemic
around the mid-1990s,” said
De Oliveira.
He added that a team of
10 specialists from around
the world who reviewed the
research think the results
are “extremely solid.”
The six medical workers,
who have protested their
innocence and said their
confessions had been made
under torture, arrived in
Libya in March 1998. They
have been in detention since
1999. (Reuters)
