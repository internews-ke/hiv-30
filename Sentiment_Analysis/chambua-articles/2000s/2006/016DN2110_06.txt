Boys with Aids
are thrown out
of orphanage

AHMEDABAD, India, Friday
Two HIV-positive boys have been
forced to leave an orphanage in India’s
Gujarat state after staff said they posed
an unacceptable risk to the safety of
other children.
“I am sad and sorry for them. Children
play, eat and fight; We cannot take
chances, others can get infected,” Ms V.
Vachonidhi, secretary of an orphanage
run by Arya Samaj, a Hindu reform
movement, said.
The two boys, aged six and nine, are
now with relatives after leaving the
home in the town Kutch, 450 km west of
the state capital. They had lived at the
orphanage for four years with about 150
other children.
Launch legal challenge
Staff could not say what had happened
to their parents or how the boys had
become infected with the virus.
The Indian “network for people living
with HIV” said it would launch a legal
challenge.
In India families often disown HIVpositive
relatives, and the children of
Aids patients have been thrown out of
schools. Landlords have refused to rent
houses those infected. About 5.7 million
Indians are infected with the virus.
