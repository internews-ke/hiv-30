{"text": "Sunday Nation/ June 18, 2006\r\n\r\nAids: Africa pays for the sins of the big men\r\nSo we now know that the virus that\r\ncauses Aids first raised its monstrous\r\nhead in Cameroon (then a French\r\ncolony) in the 1930s or 1940s. It\r\napparently passed from chimpanzees\r\nto human beings and slowly propagated\r\nin Central Africa, well below the radar of\r\nmedical science. The story of how the virus\r\nmigrated and set up camp in Southern Africa will\r\nprobably be told another day.\r\nOn May 31, world leaders gathered at the\r\nUnited Nations headquarters in New York to\r\ndiscus \ufffd for the umpteenth time \ufffd the number\r\none health concern of our times. George Bush,\r\nTony Blair, and all the other leaders of rich\r\nnations cut the meeting.\r\nWe are all now pretty familiar with the grim\r\nstatistics: 25 million Aids-related deaths since\r\n1981; three million deaths in 2005 alone; four million\r\nnew infections in 2005, the highest on record;\r\n38.6 million people living with HIV/Aids today;\r\ntwo thirds of all affected (deaths, orphans, those\r\nwithout treatment, etc) live in Africa. The only\r\ndecent news came on May 30, just before the UN\r\nconference, when Peter Piot, UNAids Executive\r\nDirector, announced findings that suggested that\r\nHIV infection around the world seem to have\r\npeaked for the first time in 25 years.\r\nIn a macabre way, according to this report, the\r\ndisease had run out of new recruits in Africa and\r\nthat medicines seem to be keeping more people\r\nalive. While South Africa has for the longest time\r\nhad the world\ufffds largest population of infected\r\npeople (some 5.2 million at the last count), it was\r\nrecently overtaken by India; and Asia is generally\r\nconsidered to be the next frontier for HIV/Aids,\r\nmostly because of national and cultural denial.\r\nIt\ufffds not like the rest of us have learnt much,\r\nhowever. As recently as last week in South Africa,\r\nthe Health Minister, Dr Manto Tshabalala-\r\nMsimang, was still talking about Aids like a\r\nderanged person, or Ms Alice in Wonderland.\r\nAppearing before the SA Parliament to defend\r\nher ministry\ufffds 2006/07 budget, the good doctor once\r\nagain talked up the value of an unusual diet in Aids\r\nprevention.\r\n\ufffdShall I repeat garlic, shall I talk about beetroot,\r\nshall I talk about lemon ... these delay the development\r\nof HIV to Aids-defining conditions, and that\ufffds\r\nthe truth,\ufffd Dr Tshabalala-Msimang said for umpteenth\r\ntime, adding emphatically that people should\r\nalso be encouraged to choose traditional over Western\r\nmedicine. There are those who think the woman\r\nshould be committed for punting for charlatans who\r\nmarket dietary remedies and traditional medicines\r\nas a cure for the world\ufffds deadliest disease.\r\nMany of them believe that part of the reason she\r\nbats so ferociously for garlic is that \ufffd with the tacit\r\napproval of President Thabo Mbeki \ufffd she does not\r\nwant to commit the South African government to\r\nbuy anti-retrovirals (ARVs) for millions of indigent\r\nsufferers who will never be able to afford them. Dr\r\nTshabalala-Msimang is as such often referred to in\r\nterms more derisive than those used to describe\r\nJacob Zuma, the ANC vice president who took a\r\nshower after having unprotected sex with an HIVpositive\r\nwoman.\r\nApparently, Bwana Zuma, age 64, and once the\r\nhead of SA\ufffds Moral Regeneration Campaign,\r\nthought that a good hot shower was as good as a\r\ncondom in saving life. His former boss has been\r\nfamously \ufffd some say unfairly \ufffd misquoted as saying\r\nthat HIV is caused by poverty, not by the virus.\r\nSo go figure.\r\nIf South Africans have been committing mostly\r\npolitical sins while their countrymen and women\r\nwere dropping like flies in a \ufffdDoom\ufffd commercial,\r\nthe rest of Africa has not been asleep. In Uganda,\r\npoliticians fed off the Global Fund to combat\r\nHIV/Aids, malaria and tuberculosis, like they were\r\ncarrion eaters. A Judicial Commission of Inquiry into\r\ncorruption at the Global Fund recently reported to\r\nPresident Yoweri Museveni, but by then, almost everyone\r\nUgandan who could read had figured it out for\r\nherself.\r\nThe probe concluded that politicians and bureaucrats\r\nhad stolen or misused most of the $45.4 million\r\n(Sh 3.2 billion) that was disbursed in a few short\r\nmonths up to August 2005. The money was part of a\r\nfive-year $201 million (Sh 14.4 billion) grant that the\r\nGlobal Fund unwisely gave to Uganda to combat the\r\nthree major illnesses. The grant was suspended but\r\nlater reinstated after the probe announcement.\r\nThe president vowed that heads would roll and\r\nprosecutions would follow. But don\ufffdt hold your\r\nbreath. Three line ministers lost their jobs when Mr\r\nMuseveni announced his new Cabinet. But then\r\nagain, the president himself sent chits to the Global\r\nFund, asking them to give money to his friends.\r\nSome of that money was even used in his political\r\ncampaigns. In Libya, the Brother Leader and his\r\nunderlings are still convinced that HIV/Aids is a\r\n\ufffdblack disease\ufffd, which might explain why they are\r\nvigorously prosecuting five Bulgarian nurses, a Bulgarian\r\ndoctor and a Palestinian doctor whom Tripoli\r\naccuses of deliberately infecting over 400 patients at\r\nthe Benghazi Children\ufffds Hospital in 1998. The seven\r\nwere sentenced to death after a typically inept trial,\r\nthen saved by international protests, and are now\r\nawaiting a retrial. Most of the infections were\r\napparently caused by unhygienic conditions that\r\neven pre-dated the arrival of the foreign health\r\nworkers, including \ufffd amazing! \ufffd re-using\r\nunsterilised syringes and needles. The Benghazi\r\ninfections have been independently blamed on\r\nnegligence, a crime that has to eventually rest at\r\nthe entrance of Brother Leader\ufffds tent.\r\nWe\ufffdll not get into wife inheritance in some parts\r\nof Kenya and elsewhere. We all have a pretty\r\ngood idea why HIV has been such a fiendish\r\nopponent in Africa. What we might never know is\r\nhow the next generation will cope with so many\r\nhomes headed by orphans; how those on ARV\r\ntherapy will cope; and how our healthcare systems\r\nwill survive after they\ufffdve been decimated by the\r\n\ufffdgreen-pasture\ufffd syndrome that deliberately lures\r\ndoctors and nurses to the northern hemisphere.\r\nOne thing is not unknown however \ufffd our priorities.\r\nWhile India has overtaken South Africa in\r\nthe infection sweepstakes, all we hear are the\r\nincredible stories of violence against women in\r\nAzania. When people become immune to the\r\nshock of the rape of a 12-month-old baby as South\r\nAfricans have, Dr Tshabalala-Msimang suddenly\r\nlooks more like a Dr Do Little, and less like the\r\nFrankenstein monster.\r\nWhen someone steals money earmarked for\r\nkeeping a poor woman alive (and poor), to build\r\nhis 20th bungalow as the Global Fund fellows did\r\nin Uganda, that man should ideally catch Aids as\r\nhis comeuppance.\r\nAnd when the Libyans blame foreigners for the\r\nsudden spike in infections at a neglected paediatric\r\nhospital, you almost wish they didn\ufffdt have that\r\noil \ufffd so they would know what it means to be\r\nboth poor and gravely ill.\r\nExperience shows that peasants, whether\r\nhealthy or ailing, are mere statistics for Africa\ufffds\r\nbig men. No wonder Bush & Co. keep finding\r\nexcuses to skip important HIV/Aids summits.\r\nskyazze@hotmail.com"}
