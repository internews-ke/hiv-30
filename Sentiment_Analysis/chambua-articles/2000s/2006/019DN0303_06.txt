Bank boss tells
of major graft
problem
ENEMY NUMBER ONE

HARARE, Thursday
Corruption is overtaking
rampant inflation as the
Zimbabwe economy’s
greatest enemy and is comparable
to the Aids epidemic that has
left no family untouched, according
to the central bank governor.
Mr Gideon Gono, head of the
Reserve Bank, said greater
efforts to stamp out worsening
graft were vital to help repair the
crumbling economy, State radio
reported yesterday.
“Corruption is fast
overtaking inflation
as enemy
Number One’’ Mr
Gono said.
Official inflation
reached 613 per
cent earlier this
year, one of the
highest rates in the world, and is
expected to reach at least 800 per
cent this month.
Zimbabwe’s economic woes have
been compounded by the
HIV/Aids epidemic, which has
infected more than 20 per cent of
the population. Health authorities
estimate some 3,000 Zimbabweans
die each week from
HIV/Aids or related illnesses
and that there are some one million
Aids orphans.
Mr Gono said all Zimbabweans
had relatives or friends affected
by HIV/Aids. “That is the same
with corruption. Corruption is
the HIV of our economy,’’ he
told military officers at the
Harare Staff College, the radio
said.
Acute shortages of food, hard
currency, gasoline and essential
imports, blamed on the economic
decline since the seizure of thousands
of white-owned commercial
farms since 2000, have
spawned brisk black market
trading in most commodities.
Petrol fetches 20 times the official
price in
illegal deals
that have
become
accepted — as
reflected in a
daily price
guide published
in the
government-run Herald newspaper.
Profiteering and fraud have
increased dramatically. Police
and state officials, driving test
examiners and power and telephone
engineers called out to
repair faults in the collapsing
utilities routinely ask for bribes.
At least six private local banks
have been put under fiscal management
by the central bank in
the past two years after executives
were accused of ploughing
cash reserves into speculative
and black market ventures. (AP)
