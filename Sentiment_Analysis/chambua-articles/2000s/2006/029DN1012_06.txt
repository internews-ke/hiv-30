Aids burden
on children
IRIN Zambia is grappling
with the growing problem of
thousands of child-headed
homes, created by one of the
highest HIV infection rates
in the world. Kapiri Mposhi,
a commercial hub in central
Zambia, has one of the highest
levels of HIV prevalence
and a significant number of
child-headed homes. UNAids
estimates the national HIV
rate at 17 per cent.
