Libya ‘likely to hang nurses in Aids case’

SOFIA, Thursday
Libya is likely to convict five Bulgarian
nurses and a Palestinian
doctor accused of purposely
infecting children with HIV, a
senior Bulgarian official said.
Mr Feim Chaushev, the deputy
foreign minister who handles the
case, said “the death sentences
would likely be confirmed,” but
warned Bulgaria would not
accept such an outcome.
“This will be unacceptable and
will trigger a negative international
reaction,” he said.
Libyan prosecutors have
demanded death sentences for
the five nurses and the doctor on
charges they infected more than
400 children with HIV at a hospital
in the Libyan city of Benghazi.
At least 50 of the children
have died. (AP)
