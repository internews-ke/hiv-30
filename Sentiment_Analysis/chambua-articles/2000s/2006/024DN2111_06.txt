Drug abusers
to get syringes
in war on Aids

By PATRICK MAYOYO
The Government plans to supply
drug abusers with hypodermic
syringes to curb the spread of
Aids.
National Agency for the Campaign
Against Drug Abuse
(Nacada) advisory board chairman
Frank Njenga said yesterday:
“The problem of drug abuse,
specifically among those who
inject themselves, has
reached alarming proportions,
and we are coming
up with a comprehensive
strategic plan to address
this problem.”
Dr Njenga was speaking
at the Aga Khan Hall
in Mombasa during a
workshop for leaders
from the district on how
to reduce drug demand
and supply.
He said HIV cases among
intravenous drug abusers at the
Coast had reached worrying proportions:
“Recent studies show
that 68 per cent of intravenous
drug abusers are HIV positive.”
Dr Njenga said although there
had been some resistance in
introducing a needle exchange
programme in the country that
would see drug abusers who
inject themselves being supplied
with new needles, the Government
was working towards
adopting the potentially controversial
system.
“Although the issue of needle
exchange programme was put on
hold because it is culturally sensitive,
awareness creation about
this programme is going on, and
we are going to adopt it because
it’s the most strategic way of
dealing with the
problem.”
M o m b a s a D C
Maalim Mohammed
said the problem of
drug abuse in Mombasa
was on the rise despite
different programmes
adopted by the Government
to address it.
“More than 20 people
are being arraigned
in courts on drug related charges
every month,” he said.
Nacada director Sheikh Juma
Ngao asked the Government to
declare drug abuse a national
disaster for adequate resources
to be mobilised to address it.
And Nacada national coordinator
Jennifer Kimani congratulated
Kenyan anti-narcotics campaigner
Murad Saad, for winning
a UN award for his efforts.
