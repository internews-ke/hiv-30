Stalking the Aids virus

work. At the moment, there is an
innovative condom distribution
system, which is supposed to
work hand in hand with the
mobile VCT strategy.
Because of the pastoralism lifestyle,
UNFPA is facilitating the
distribution of condoms through
dispensers placed on tree
branches along strategic routes.
This enables men to pick these
condoms as they go about their
daily activities.
“The best strategy to intervene
in the prevention and
management of
HIV/Aids in areas
like Samburu is coming
up plans that fit
well with the way of
life of these people,”
says Judy Karogo of
UNFPA.
With the walking
VCT and condom dispensers
patched on
trees, there is hope to
reduce HIV prevalence from the
current 8.1 per cent. “But easier
said than done,” says Ebongon
At times when he
goes for a prior
appointment he
might find the client
has moved, in
which case he has to
track them down—
a herculean task.
The other challenge
is that people are
demanding to be
given ARVs before
they agree to be
tested. The situation becomes
more difficult as those found to
be HIV positive constantly follow
him wanting to be provided with
the drugs.
Although some of the hospitals in
the district have ARVs, those
infected have to walk for over 50
kilometres to reach the nearest
centre.
A number of his clients who came
for pre-test counselling have
failed to return for post-test counselling;
while others have never
returned for another test after the
three months window period.
The situation is equally difficult
for him when he tries to convince
his relatives friends and acquaintances
to be tested. “Some of
these people fear that confidentiality
will be compromised and
would rather have the test done
by a stranger.”
Despite all these difficulties,
mobile VCT centres are being
touted as the best strategy in
reaching out to as many people as
possible in the rural areas and
communities living in extreme
remote areas.
In a recent interview, Dr Kevin
DeCock, former director of the
US Centres for Disease Control
in Kenya, said establishing VCT
centres in areas where people are
dispersed was going to be a waste
of resources.
He argued that the use of mobile
VCT centres which are operated
by people not from the community
where the tests are being
done would be the best way forward.
