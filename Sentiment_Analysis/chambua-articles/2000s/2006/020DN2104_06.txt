Spirited campaign to stop human rights abuses in industry takes root

By JOHN OYWA
Awoman is putting the finishing
touches to a bulky
training manual she has
been preparing for a month
in a small office at Tom
Mboya estate in Kisumu.
This week, she is handling three topics:
“Human Rights for Women in the Fishing
Industry”, “Sex-For-Fish and Aids”
and “Micro Finance Management for
Women Fish Traders”.
Lying on the far end of her desk is a
Food and Agriculture Organisation 1998
report titled: “Women Feed the
World”, with a kicker to the effect that
more than half of the world’s food is
produced by women.
Meet Ms Jennipher Kere, the woman
who left a plum job in the Ministry of
Education to champion the rights of
women fish traders.
For five years, Ms Kere has been spearheading
a campaign to end what she
terms gender discrimination and human
rights abuses in the fishing industry.
Fishing project
An organisation she helped found in
2002 — Women in the Fishing Industry
Project (Wifip) — has produced radio
programmes and distributed training
manuals to women in all the major
beaches of Lake Victoria.
Wifip, Ms Kere says, has helped form 15
women’s groups in Nyando, Kisumu,
Bondo and Busia districts to sensitise
women on their rights, Aids, and fish
marketing.
“I started the organisation because I
knew women needed information and
empowerment if they were to survive in
the male-dominated fishing industry”,
she told the Nation.
She says sex-for-fish is traumatising, and
blames it on ignorance and poverty ravaging
many communities in the Lake
Basin.
“It is a complex phenomenon. The
women are not being forced into sex.
There are conditional factors that force
them to sleep with men,” says Ms Kere.
She adds: “There’s a group of women
that is just ignorant. The women don’t
know the dangers
involved in reckless
sex. Some do it out
of desperation — to
survive. These
include widows who
have children to
feed.”
Many of the woman
trapped in the sex-for-fish business are
not from the fishing communities and
might have run away from their matrimonial
homes after divorcing or losing
their husbands.
Some are on the beaches to escape traditional
customs like wife inheritance.
The women in the fishing industry are
mainly involved in post-harvest activities
like fish smoking, drying and marketing.
Mrs Kere says women flock the beaches
because fish trade is easy to start. One
needs only about Sh500 to start trading
in fresh or dried fish. Others start it
without a single cent — on credit.
Development agencies
She says the islands where most of the
vulnerable women live have been
neglected by the Government and other
development agencies.
These islands, like Ringiti, Remba,
Migingo and others have no health centres,
and fishermen and women fish
traders are being decimated by Aids.
“I once shed tears when I visited Ringiti
Island. The level of immorality and
ignorance was shocking. HIV-related
deaths were horrifying,” says Ms Kere.
She adds: “The people living on the
islands are in dire need of voluntary
counselling and testing centres (VCTs).
They also need anti-retroviral drugs and
education on how to live positively with
the virus.”
There is also need to advise the fishing
communities to change their eating habits
as a way of guarding against opportunistic
diseases brought by HIV. Fish is
the main source of food on the beaches.
Ms Kere says women fall prey to sex
pests on the beaches because they have
never known their rights. They never
negotiate, even for things they have a
right to get.
To overcome these problems Ms Kere
wants the Government and its development
partners to start elaborate health
and human rights campaigns on the
beaches.
“There is an urgent need to empower
the women through education and financial
assistance to enable them to start
businesses. They should be encouraged
to form groups and buy boats, if possible,”
she says.
Empowerment, she explains, is not just
about giving the women money to start
business, but a wholesome approach that
includes educating women on their
rights and good business management.
“Staff at Wifip tried an integrated
approach in addressing women issues on
satellite beaches in four districts and it
worked. Women targeted have
improved their businesses, and no longer
depend on free fish”, she says.
Ms Kere’s organisation has been giving
loans to women through a micro-finance
revolving fund. This has enabled them to
diversify into other income-generating
projects.
A research commissioned by Wifip in
August 2002 indicates that about 44 per
cent of women in the fishing industry fall
between the ages of 25 to 39. About 19
per cent are aged 40 and above, while
the rest are aged below 25.
Standard Eight
About 48 per cent of women involved in
fish trade on the beaches have been to
school up to Standard Eight. Only One
out of 229 have college
education,
while 29 per cent
have secondary
education.
Twenty-one per
cent of the women
are widows, two per
cent are separated
from their husbands while 26 per cent
are in polygamous unions.
The report says that about 63 per cent of
women trading in fish save their earnings
through “merry-go-rounds”.
Fifteen per cent save in form of animals,
while only six per cent save in banks.
There are no banks on the beaches, and
fish traders have to travel long distances
to Migori, Kisumu, Homa Bay, Bondo,
Siaya or Busia to acess banking.
Some women, about 1.3 per cent according
to the research, leave their money
with shopkeepers.
About 33 per cent save between Sh51 to
Sh100 per week.
The report indicates that while most
women (51.8 per cent) use family contributions
to start fish businesses, some
eight per cent get credit from fishermen.
