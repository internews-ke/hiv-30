{"text": "Daily Nation/ Friday, June 2, 2006\r\n\r\nAnnan tells leaders to help\r\nprostitutes battle Aids\r\n\r\nUNITED NATIONS, Thursday\r\nUN Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan challenged world leaders\r\nyesterday to protect the\r\nmost marginal groups in society from\r\nAids \ufffd prostitutes, drug users and\r\nhomosexuals.\r\nMr Annan and General Assembly\r\nPresident Jan Eliasson opened a\r\nthree-day conference on Aids that\r\nincludes thousands of activists, ministers\r\nand diplomats to assess progress\r\nso far.\r\nTo combat Aids, \ufffdIt means we must\r\nwork closely and constructively with\r\nthose who have too often been marginalised\r\n\ufffd sex workers, injecting\r\ndrug users and men who have sex\r\nwith men,\ufffd Annan said.\r\n\ufffdWe need to be realistic,\ufffd Mr Annan\r\nsaid. \ufffdIf we are here to try and end\r\nthe epidemic\r\nand fight the\r\nepidemic, we\r\nwill not succeed\r\nby\r\nputting our\r\nheads in the\r\nsand and pretending\r\nthese\r\npeople do not\r\nexist or do not need help.\ufffd\r\nAccording to a major UNAids report\r\nreleased on Tuesday, the spread of\r\nthe pandemic had slowed but drug\r\ntreatment is only available to less than\r\nhalf of those infected with HIV, the\r\nvirus that causes Aids.\r\nStill, many delegations, particularly\r\nIslamic ones and some conservative\r\nLatin American nations, refuse to\r\nmention prostitutes, drug users and\r\nhomosexuals, in a final statement now\r\nunder negotiation.\r\nThey prefer citing \ufffdvulnerable\ufffd\r\ngroups, fearing that specific mention\r\nwould endorse these groups. Also in\r\ndispute are rights for girls and sex\r\neducation, among other issues.\r\nThe United States took the same position\r\nat the last major UN Aids conference\r\nin 2001 but US officials said this\r\nno longer was the case.\r\n\ufffdWe would love the mention of vulnerable\r\npopulations -- generally, specifically,\ufffd\r\nsaid Assistant Secretary of State\r\nKirsten Silverberg, who heads the State\r\nDepartment office responsible for UN\r\naffairs.\r\nBut an early marked-up draft showed\r\nUS objections to a European proposal\r\non services for homosexuals, sex workers\r\nand drug users. The United States\r\nrejected the paragraph mainly because it\r\ncalled for \ufffdharm reduction,\ufffd a euphemism\r\nfor needle exchanges, which\r\nWashington opposes.\r\nMr Annan also stressed the increase of\r\nwomen contracting the disease, especially\r\nin sub-Sahara Africa. Of the more\r\nthan 38 million people infected worldwide,\r\n17 million are women, threequarters\r\nof them in Africa, said the UN\r\nreport. Particularly disadvantaged are\r\nwomen who have been raped, including\r\nchild brides by their husbands and\r\nwomen who are never diagnosed and\r\ntreated.\r\n\ufffdI believe that we are having such a big\r\nepidemic, among other reasons, because\r\nof the lack of control of women over\r\nsexuality,\ufffd Dr Peter Piot, the executive\r\ndirector of UNAids, the leading group\r\ncampaigning against the pandemic.\r\nThe three-day meeting is timed to the\r\n25th anniversary of the first documented\r\nAids cases on June 5, 1981. It is aimed at\r\nsetting guidelines for universal treatment\r\nand prevention.\r\nDr Piot said he hoped the meeting will\r\ngenerate long-term funding for\r\nHIV/Aids, which needs some $20 billion\r\nannually by 2010. Spending in\r\n2005 met its target of $8 billion.\r\nThe United States is by far the largest\r\ndonor, with President George W.\r\nBush having pledged $15 billion over\r\nfive years. But Dr Mark Dybul, acting\r\nUS global Aids coordinator, said\r\nWashington did not believe in \ufffdlargescale\r\ninternational targets\ufffd because\r\neach country had to set its own.\r\nHowever, the final declaration is at an\r\nimpasse, said Ms Adrienne Germain,\r\npresident of the International Women\ufffds\r\nHealth Coalition, who has been\r\nfollowing Aids debates for two decades.\r\nEven some diplomats from Africa are\r\ngoing back on agreements their leaders\r\nhad reached in early May, she said.\r\n\ufffdThere is no leadership as far as I can\r\nsee ... on many issues.\ufffd\r\nAccording to the report released on\r\nTuesday, a worldwide survey has\r\nfound that nearly 40 million people\r\nworldwide are living with HIV/Aids.\r\nIndia now has the largest number of\r\nAids infections, but the epidemic still\r\nremains at its worst in sub-Saharan\r\nAfrica, where per capita rates continue\r\nto climb in several countries.\r\nThe virus \ufffdhas spread further, faster\r\nand with more catastrophic long-term\r\neffects than any other disease,\ufffd\ufffd Mr\r\nAnnan said. \ufffdIts impact has become a\r\ndevastating obstacle to the progress of\r\nhumankind.\ufffd\ufffd\r\nBut, civil society groups said they\r\nfeared that there was not a real sense\r\nof urgency among diplomats at the\r\nmeeting to put forward specific proposals\r\nor shed outdated ideas about\r\nthe virus.\r\n\ufffdEven though Aids should be everybody\ufffds\r\nproblem and issue, and everyone\r\nshould care about it, I\ufffdm sorry\r\nto say that for the most part the diplomats\r\nin this building either don\ufffdt care\r\nor don\ufffdt know,\ufffd\ufffd said Ms Germain.\r\nMost of the targets from 2001 have\r\nnot been met. Among the biggest failures\r\nwas the so-called \ufffd3 by 5'\ufffd target\r\n\ufffd of getting treatment to three million\r\npoor people infected with Aids by\r\nthe end of 2005. (Agencies)"}
