Barclays urges firms
to up Aids spending

By NATION Correspondent
Barclays Bank says that big
multi-national companies
must do more to help people
afflicted by Aids across Africa.
In a new report entitled The
Impact of HIV/Aids on African
Economies which was compiled
by a group of economists,
Barclays says companies have
a corporate responsibility
towards their staff.
The international banking
group, which already provides
free drugs, Aids testing and
counselling for its 40,000
employees across Africa said it
was both morally and economically
right for companies to
act now. Mr Gary Hoffman,
the head of corporate responsibility
at Barclays told a
conference co-hosted by
UNICEF to mark World Aids
Day that the work that the
bank was doing on the ground
in Africa was changing and
saving lives.
“For our employees its really
important we look after them.
Theres one territory in Africa
where nearly four out of 10
Barclays employees are HIV
positive. That’s clearly a serious
issue for families and a
serious issue for business, in
terms of absence.”
Barclays says that GDP rates
across the continent will fall
unless companies do more. Mr
Hoffman predicted that in
South Africa alone growth
rates could fall by 1.5 per cent
a year, unless more was done.
