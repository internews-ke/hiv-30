Museveni condemns Aids infection study

KAMPALA, Friday
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has condemned a new study
showing that male circumcision
reduces the risk of HIV infection
during sex, saying it has sent out a
dangerous message.
The state-owned New Vision
newspaper today quoted him as
saying that there were many
confusing messages about
HIV/Aids.
“One of them is that if you are
circumcised, you are less likely to
catch Aids even if you behave recklessly.
Now what sort of message is
that?” the paper quoted him as
telling medical students in
Kampala.
A study conducted in western
Kenya and eastern Uganda, where
circumcision is a common practice,
this month by the US National
Institutes of Health found out that
it reduced the risk of infection by
48-53 percent.
Museveni rejected the study’s
conclusion, saying Uganda’s apparent
success at controlling the virus
— official figures say prevalence
fell from 30 per cent to 6 per cent
in the early 1990s — was by telling
youths to abstain from sex.
The study had said circumcision
is to be seen as “only part of a
broader HIV prevention strategy
that includes limiting ... sexual
partners and using condoms”.
Campaigners say Uganda’s
HIV/Aids strategy has been
hijacked by right-wing Christian
groups. (Reuters)
