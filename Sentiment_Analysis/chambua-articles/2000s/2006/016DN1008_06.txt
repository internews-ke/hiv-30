Gates gives Sh36bn to Aids fund

WASHINGTON, Wednesday
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
said today it was giving $500 million
(Sh36 billion) to the Global Fund to
Fight Aids, TB and Malaria, by far its
biggest grant to the fund, which says it
sorely lacks cash.
The money, to be given over five
years, is the largest private donation to
the fund, founded nearly five years ago
to serve as the primary financing vehicle
for efforts to fight the HIV pandemic,
tuberculosis and malaria.
The fund has always struggled to persuade
rich nations to contribute.
“Even with this support, it is likely
that the fund will need an additional
$500 million to reach our goal of $1.1
billion to fully fund all of the grants that
we expect to approve for our sixth round
of funding,” said Mr Richard Feachem,
Executive Director of the Global Fund.
Mr Richard Burzynski of the International
Council of Aids Service Organisations
said the fund has a predicted $2.1
billion shortfall for this year and next
year alone.
So far, the fund has committed a total
of $5.4 billion in grants, mostly to poor
countries. It prides itself on making
recipients account for the money and
earlier this year withdrew some funding
for Nigeria.
“The Global Fund is one of the most
important health initiatives in the world
today,” Mr Gates, who founded Microsoft
said in a statement.
Mr Gates and
t h e f u n d
announced the
cash gift less than
a week before the
16th International
Aids Conference,
being
held this year in
Toronto. The
Gates Foundation
pledged $100
million to the
Fund in 2001, and
$50 million in
2004. The Geneva-based fund, administered
independently, was responsible for
about a fifth of all international funding
for programmes to fight HIV in 2005.
This included HIV drugs for 544,000
people, more than 1.4 million people
treated for TB and more than 11 million
bed nets distributed to protect children
from malaria. “As we move from crisis
management to a sustained Aids
response, we will continue to rely on the
Global Fund as the best model to provide
strategic and predictable funding,”
said Dr Peter Piot, Executive Director of
the United Nations Aids agency
UNAids.
Recipients also praised the Fund.
“The Global Fund has provided us with
the support we need to drive back Aids
and other diseases, and I am happy to
see that this contribution will help it continue
to do so for years to come,” President
Paul Kagame of Rwanda said.
