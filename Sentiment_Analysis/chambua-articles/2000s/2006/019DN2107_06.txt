Prosecutors
seek delay in
Zuma case

JOHANNESBURG, Thursday
Prosecutors in the corruption case
against former Deputy President Jacob
Zuma and a French weapons company
have asked the Durban High Court to
postpone the trial, a lawyer
said today.
A request was filed
today and arguments will
be heard on July 31, the
day the trial was scheduled
to begin, prosecutor Anton
Steynberg told the South
African Press Association.
He provided no further
details. Lawyers for Mr
Zuma and the Thint Holdings
arms manufacturer
could not immediately be
reached for comment.
Prosecutors last month sent letters to
the defence teams seeking to postpone
the trial until February. Then, both
defence teams opposed the move, saying
they wanted speedy trials for their
clients.
Mr Zuma, who was acquitted in May
of a separate rape charge, was once considered
the most likely to succeed President
Thabo Mbeki when he steps down
at the end of his second term in 2009.
Mr Zuma was fired as deputy
president last year after the judge in a
graft case against Zuma’s friend and
financial adviser Schabir Shaik concluded
the two men had a “generally
corrupt’’ relationship.
The judge found Mr Shaik had made
payments to the former anti-apartheid
fighter totaling some 1.2 million
rands (Sh124 million) to
fund a lavish lifestyle.
He also found that Mr
Zuma was aware of Mr
Shaik’s efforts to facilitate a
yearly payment of 500,000
rands (Sh5 million) to the exdeputy
president from Thint
Holdings — formerly Thomson
CSF — to deflect investigations
into a 1999 arms deal
with the South African government.
Mr Shaik is appealing his conviction.
Mr Zuma denies any wrongdoing.
In April, Mr Zuma caused an uproar
when he told the court that he showered
after he had unprotected sex with an
HIV positive woman to reduce the risk
of becoming infected with the Aids
virus. Mr Zuma, 63, was accused of raping
a 31-year-old family friend.
Mr Zuma said that he did not use a
condom because he believed the risks of
him contracting the disease were minimal.
