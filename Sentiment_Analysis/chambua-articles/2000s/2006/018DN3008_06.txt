Hang nurses, Libya court told
Five Bulgarians accused of infecting 426 children with the Aids virus

TRIPOLI, Tuesday
A Libyan prosecutor today demanded
the death penalty for five Bulgarian
nurses and a Palestinian doctor on trial
for the second time on charges that they
infected hundreds of children with the
HIV virus.
“The act was cruel, criminal and inhuman.
It’s a human catastrophe,” prosecutor
Omar Abdulkhaleq told the
Tripoli court, adding that 53 of the 430
children infected had subsequently died.
“We demand the death penalty for the
accused.”
A previous trial of the six, who have
been detained since 1999, ended with
their conviction on charges they intentionally
infected 426 children with HIV
when they worked in a hospital in Benghazi
in the late 1990s.
In December 2005,
the supreme court
overturned the convictions,
which had
resulted in sentences
of death by firing
squad, and sent the
case back to a lower
court. The retrial began in May 2006.
The nurses, including Palestinian doctor
Ashraf Alhajouj and Bulgarians
Snezhana Dimitrova, Nasya Nenova,
Valentina Siropolu, Christiana Valcheva
and Valia Cherveniashka denied the
charges in both their first and second trials
and have repeatedly testified that
they were tortured to
make them confess.
Mr Abdulkhaleq
added that the six
had also committed
offences related to
buying and selling
alcohol, having illicit
sexual relations and
illegally carrying out hard currency
exchange. Sex outside marriage is illegal
in Libya. The six deny those accusations.
He said without elaborating that 20
mothers of the children had become
infected with the virus through breastfeeding
their infected infants.
Bulgaria and its allies support the
nurses’ torture claims and global Aids
experts say the outbreak at the Benghazi
hospital where they worked began
before they arrived.
Around 50 of the children have died,
fuelling popular anger in Libya.
Tripoli has suggested the nurses could
go free if Bulgaria pays compensation to
the children and their families, who have
demanded 4.4 billion euros. Bulgaria has
refused to pay but has joined other
nations to create an aid fund. The retrial
was adjourned to September 5.
