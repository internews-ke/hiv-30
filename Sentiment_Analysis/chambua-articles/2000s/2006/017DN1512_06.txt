new study shows
Challenge is
to make the
cut affordable
ow that it has
been shown that
circumcision can
reduce the risk of
contracting Aids,
the next challenge involves
raising the money and the
medical personnel needed to
conduct millions of circumcisions
every year.
Each procedure can cost
anywhere between Sh300 to
Sh2,000 depending on the
health facility. Of concern
also would be the fact that
conducting the procedure in
non-hospital situations
could actually lead to the
spread of HIV and other
blood-borne diseases
through contaminated
instruments.
But according to researchers,
the greatest challenge
lies in educating people that
circumcision is not a silver
bullet against HIV. This
message will especially be
critical for newly circumcised
men who run the danger
of engaging in risky sexual
behaviour under the
illusion that they are protected
against infection.
According to researchers,
circumcision should only be
part of a broader HIV prevention
strategy that
includes limiting the
number of sexual partners
and using condoms during
intercourse.
Those involved in the
studies have cautioned that
the use of circumcision is
itself fraught with risk and
controversy. For one, circumcision
is not universally
culturally accepted. In Kenya,
some communities practice
it while others do not.
And Dr Mark Dybul, executive
director of President
Bush’s Sh1 trillion ($15 billion)
Emergency Plan for
Aids Relief, said in a statement
that his agency “will
support implementation of
safe, medical male circumcision
for HIV/Aids prevention”
if world health agencies
recommend it.
He also warned that it
was only one new weapon in
the fight, adding: “Prevention
efforts must reinforce
the ABC approach —
abstain, be faithful and correct
and consistent use of
condoms.”
Researchers have long
noted that parts of Africa
where circumcision is common
— particularly the Muslim
countries of West Africa
— have much lower Aids
rates, while those in southern
Africa, where circumcision
is rare, have the
highest. Outside Muslim
regions, circumcision is
spotty.
In South Africa, for example,
the Xhosa people circumcise
teenage boys, while
Zulus do not. Aids is common
in both tribes.
Former South African
president Nelson Mandela’s
autobiography, Long Walk
to Freedom, contains an
unnerving but hilarious
account of his own Xhosa
circumcision, by spear blade,
as a teenager. Although he
was supposed to shout: “I
am a man!” he grimaced in
pain, he wrote.
But not all initiation ceremonies
are laughing matters.
Every year, some South
African teenagers die from
infections, and the use of
one blade on many young
men may help spread Aids.
