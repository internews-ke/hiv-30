Meet playwright Cajetan Boy
His crusading spirit refused to be confined to the world of offices and ties

By Kamau Mutunga 
If you go to the Internet and
“google” the name Cajetan
Boy, you’ll get thousands of
sites harping one or two
things about him. Seven
years ago, your search
would have yielded the response, “the
name does not match any documents.”
Not any more for the man best
known as the script writer for the locally
popular soap operas, Better Days and
Heart&Soul.
Meet Cajetan Boy, the resident playwright
at Et Cetera Productions and
arguably Kenya’s most prolific playwright,
film and soap script writer.
And at the just concluded Kenya
International Film Festival (KIFF) held
at the Alliance Francaise Auditorium,
local film lovers got a preview of his latest
efforts for the silver screen.
Roho and Deadly Ties, a 40-minute
preview of a 30-part television soap
opera were screened to a full house. He
also acted in Vincent Mbaya’s film,
Emancipation, also shown at the Alliance
Francaise, besides the 2004 film
adaptation of his play, By Any Means
Necessary, in which Helen Keli scooped
the Best Actress’
Award for her role
as Jezebel.
It has also been
nominated for exhibition
at the forthcoming
Los Angeles
Film Festival.
Getting into film
was a deviation
from his earlier
calling for which he
is known— the
stage — for which
he has written six
full-length plays
starting with Benta
in 1999, followed
by All Girls
Together; Family
Ties; By Any Means Necessary; Backlash
and DeadTalk, which made its
debut at the Phoenix Players in April
this year.
Benta is the perennial favourite. It
has been translated and performed in
Dholuo and Kikuyu as Mos, Benta, Mos
and Kahora, Benta respectively. Giles
Migan, a visiting American teacher, was
so enthralled after watching it that she
had it published by Jacaranda Designs
for use by her students back home.
Family Ties, on the other hand, was
adapted as a television drama series and
serialised by a local television station
two years ago, while Backlash is in the
film editing stages at Sisimka studios.
We were recounting all these developments
in his life on this humid Thursday
afternoon at the Professional Centre
pub, whose basement houses The
Phoenix Players’, Kenya’s only repertory
theatre, where Cajetan or “Caje”
to his pals, is directing Eva Moberg’s
subtle comedy, Forever Young.
I survey his clean shaven dome, bushy
beard, two earrings on his left ear,
beaded bracelets in national colours,
numerous silver rings, faded jeans...Caje
cuts the profile of your typical Kenyan
thespian — informal, artistically expressive.
Himself.
He stares at me with his glassy eyes,
which transports me into a time capsule
back to 1994 or thereabouts. The place
was Fort Jesus estate in Kibera inside a
single Spartan room. There was only a
mattress. And in, shuffled a tall marvinclad
man in faded jeans and sneakers.
He was a student at the University, I
was told.
“Meet Dick” David Mwangi, my
former schoolmate whom I had gone to
visit, said by way of introduction. I was
to see Dick again in 1996 at the defunct
Miujiza Players’ Theatre. He was acting
as Bin Broker in Meja Mwangi’s The
Plague, alongside Caroline Odongo, a
respectable theatre director whom he
later married.
And I made a mental note to ask
“Dick” when, how and why he became
“Cajetan Boy”.
“That year was my turning point. I
had seen a press advert seeking performing
artistes to act in scripts for USAidsponsored
HIV/Aids awareness campaigns
at the Miujiza Players. And I was
picked. But the project required six
plays and the submitted ones didn’t
meet the required criteria.”
Cajetan plunged head-on into script
writing with Dilemma, Leon, Why? and
Victim, which were performed all over
the country. Thereafter, he became
totally immersed in theatre.
His fertile imagination and prolific
pen saw him write Marital Affairs,
Working woman, Food for Thought and
Cuts of Brutality, which were all taken
up by NGO advocacy groups.
The then doyen of Kenyan theatre,
James Falkland approached him. He told
him to duplicate the success he had with
One Act plays with a simple, but full
length play and Benta — a moving portrayal
of the injustices perpetrated by
class systems— premiered to full houses
in 1999.
“People thought Falkland was mad to
have a Kenyan play staged at the upmarket
Phoenix Players’. But he went
further and encouraged me to pen a
lighter play with a single set and few
actors and All Girls Together was the
result. In 2001, the play was adapted and
serialised by a local TV station.”
Themes in his plays revolve around
relationships, crime, poverty and poor
governance. “My plays subconsciously
reflect what is going on in our society,”
says Cajetan whose muse is not inspired
by other playwrights.
Actually, he prefers reading science
fiction, elements of which can be discerned
from DeadTalk, a play that
revolves around the question: what
would a dead person do, given a second
chance at life?
The action took place in a city mortuary
where two undertakers, Paco and
Noah, were attending to the bodies of
Miles, who had died of HIV complications;
Baraka, a thug who was shot 12
times; Nayla who died while procuring an
abortion after being raped and Lucilla, a
happy-go-lucky woman who was run
over by a philandering hubby.
But quarter-way through the play,
similar questions are posed by in a “dialogue
of the dead” when the deceased
wake up as spirits, providing insights
into their lives before they died while
questioning the meaning of life at the
same time.
Treachery, loneliness, carelessness,
crime, ambition and human superficiality
are some of the themes explored in
this play whose germ-seed was an idea
from Nicholas Ombewa.
How does he prod the muse for such
plays?
“I can think about a play’s storyline
for three months, but I take three weeks
to put it together. I wrote Episode Two
of Deadly Ties in two days. I don’t experience
writers’s block as I work on multiple
scripts. If I get stuck on one, I jump
to the other. I save my ideas as SMSes
on my cellphone so that I don’t forget
them,” says Cajetan, who has acted in
over 30 productions among them A Man
for all Seasons, Taming of the Shrew and
the Good woman of Setswan, his most
memorable play where he acted as
Wang, the water seller.
But the last time we watched him on
stage was in December 2005 at the
Phoenix Players when he acted as Shaka
Zulu in John Githongo’s debut
effort,Shaka Zulu is Coming to Dinner.
