Confused on SA visit,
is this part of Africa?
By BARRY MOODY
JOHANNESBURG,

Landing in Johannesburg
from anywhere else in
Africa can be a deeply disorientating
experience, no matter
how many times you do it.
In fact the contrasts are so great,
you can end up wondering if you
are still in Africa at all.
Confusion sets in as soon as you
head into town along a network
of fine roads that would put
London to shame, let alone the
dusty potholed streets of most
African cities.
If there are traffic jams, it is
because too many gleaming
BMW, Mercedes and other new
cars are racing home to indulge
the almost religious devotion to
quality leisure time.
In Nairobi, where I live, you can
get held up on the main airport
road at almost any time by the
crazed antics of battered minibuses
and hoards of scruffy cars
playing Russian roulette at the
many roundabouts — a much
more typically African experience.
In another striking contrast, the
plush northern suburbs of
Johannesburg are dotted with
ritzy shopping malls where
designer stores sell luxury clothing
at European prices.
In fact, shopping seems to be the
major pastime for well-off whites
and blacks, fuelling a retail
boom which the central bank
admits it is struggling to choke,
despite rising inflation.
There are many other signs of
prosperity here. During a recent
public holiday my inquiry about
booking a room at a country
hotel was met with a derisive:
“But we have been booked up
for months sir.”
Yet more than a decade after
apartheid was defeated, this
prosperity is still one-sided —
most of the clients
in the plush
hotels and restaurants
are white
and the staff
black.
The private economy,
as opposed
to political power,
is still largely in
white hands and
although a black
middle class is
rapidly expanding,
the fruits of
black rule are taking
a long time to
reach the majority
of the population.
Some other things also seem
hardly to have changed.
Rugby, long the national game, is
still mostly a white preserve. At a
recent match against Australia,
most of the team and almost all
the crowd were white. Security
men at the gate appeared to be
the same beefy, broken-nosed
white men as a decade ago, albeit
now cordial to blacks.
An impressive network
South Africa’s prosperity and
contrasts are not confined to
Johannesburg. From the graceful
winelands of the Western Cape
to the beautiful coasts of
KwaZulu-Natal, the entire country
is linked with an impressive
network of well-surfaced roads
that could not be more of a contrast
to my home in Kenya.
One of Kenya’s premier tourist
attractions, the Maasai Mara
reserve, is linked to Nairobi by
roads that often resemble a
dried-up river bed, complete
with rocks and pools of water.
A glance at some statistics
illustrates the
contrasts.
South Africa is the
undisputed economic
giant of sub-Saharan
Africa. With six per
cent of the population
it has more than onethird
of the GDP —
three times that of
second-placed Nigeria
and 40 times more
than Mali. Nevertheless,
despite South Africa’s
enormous achievements,
outward
impressions can obscure
many challenging problems,
including the slow trickle-down
of wealth to the majority.
South Africa has some of the
world’s worst violent crime and
the greatest caseload of Aids
cases, with one in nine of its 45
million population infected with
HIV.
Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the
anti-apartheid hero and South
Africa’s moral conscience, said
recently he was deeply concerned
about crime and the widening
gap between rich and
poor.
“We need to be very careful that
the poor don’t begin to say
’Where is the freedom
dividend?’... I am very surprised
that it has taken them so long to
vent their anger and their impatience,”
he said. (Reuters)
