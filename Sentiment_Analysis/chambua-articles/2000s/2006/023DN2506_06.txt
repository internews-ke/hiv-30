Orphan sees
hairdressing
as window
out of poverty

By WARUGURU MUCHIRA
Rosemary Kabura is a
happy 19 year-old.
Despite she and her four
siblings being orphaned,
and having to depend on their
aunt’s support for the past three
years, she can now earn a certificate
in hair dressing, which gives
her greater hope in the future.
Mr Josiah Gatuni, 23, is also a
resident of Korogocho. He finished
his ‘O’ level studies last year
and attained a C-.
After this, he spent a lot of time
loitering in the sprawling
Kariobangi estate.
The eldest in a family of three,
he is currently supporting his sister
though a small video shop,
while his younger brother lives
upcountry.
Now he wants to study hairdressing,
and perhaps make a reasonable
living out of it.
Both Ms Kabura and Mr Gatuni
among 52 students benefiting
from a project run by World
Vision, an international non-governmental
organisation, and
Ashleys Hair and Beauty
Academy as part of its Kariobangi
HIV Project.
The project aims at providing
youth orphaned by HIV/Aids with
skills.
In a memorandum of understanding
between the two organisations,
World Vision will pay a
total of Sh1.04 million for the
duration of the course which is
Sh20,000 per student while
Ashleys will subsidize the remaining
Sh25,000 at a total cost of
Sh1.3 million for 2006.
The training lasts six months,
covering various aspects of hair
dressing.
"If World Vision was not
around, my aunt would have had
to struggle to see how I would get
college," shares Ms Kabura.
"Now I can help my younger
ones and I promised I won’t let her
down," she says in reference to her
three younger siblings one of
whom is in Form 2, while the others
are in Standard Eight and
Standard One respectively.
"When I was in school, I was
interested in hair," says Mr
Gatuni. He relied on his aunt for
his secondary school fees.
"The school has a good foundation
with an international certificate,
and I know I have a good
chance to work in a good salon,"
he says, sharing his future plans.
He reveals that Ashleys has
promised the top four graduating
students employement in the salon
and barber shop, "I am working
very hard to be one of them."
According to the academy's
director and principal, Terry
Mungai, the seeds for the school
were sown early this year, when
World Vision approached her to
support its Kariobangi programme.
"The challenging part is how
much they were willing to give,
but for me I believe that when you
give more, you get more," she
recounts.
With Sh1.3 million paid upfront
by World Vision as their contribution,
Ms Mungai was able to
secure a suitable location in
Kariobangi.
"It was important that we bring
the school close to the students, so
that they do not have to incur costs
of transport and miss classes or
arrive late."
Ms Mungai also stocked the
school with hair care and beauty
products for the practical lessons.
"We had to make the purchase
at once because we just get the
one off payment, whereas in town
it is continuous," she says comparing
the operations of the school
based in town. "Even though we
are in Kariobangi, we have to
maintain standards and keep the
image."
The school comprises two
classrooms and a salon where the
students undertake their practical
sessions.
The salon is also open to external
clients, and the students earn a
commission on every client they
service.
The school spirit has also had
an impact on the students. As Ms
Kabura says, "Here we pray and
worship and I know by the end of
the six months, many of our lives
will have changed."
Ms Mungai is determined that
her students will make something
of themselves, and she often gives
them motivational talks: "I tell
them they should not let their
environment limit them because
you are as big or as small as you
think you are."
Ms Kabura dreams of eventually
becoming a professional cosmetologist.
"When I get a job, I’d
like to support the others."
Ms Mungai says that their practical
experience will go a long
way in gearing them towards success.
"The salon is very important,
because they are already gaining
experience of the workplace. Most
salons pay on commission so the
more clients you have, the more
you make," says Ms Mungai. The
commission is paid on weekly
basis.
With knowledge on how to provide
good services and treat their
customers well, thus retaining
them, the partnership project
hopes that the HIV orphans will
be able to uplift their lives and
those of their families.
