Medics may escape
Libya firing squad

TRIPOLI, Wednesday
Six foreigners condemned to
die for infecting Libyan children
with HIV have every
chance of escaping the firing
squad, analysts say, despite
Libyans’ profound anger over
the case.
A government-led body will
have the final say on the fate of
the Palestinian doctor and five
Bulgarian nurses, and analysts
say it would be able to commute
the sentences in a move
that would advance Libya’s
rapprochement with the West.
“The Libyans are telling the
world, ’Don’t worry, the case is
still open’,” a European ambassador
said.
Libyans on the street today
poured scorn on Western concern
for the six sentenced to
death on Tuesday for deliberately
infecting hundreds of
children with the virus that
causes Aids.
Independent scientists say
the six are actually scapegoats
for failings in the Libyan
health system.
But to Libyans that argument
smacks of Western
arrogance.
Shopkeeper Ahmed Silam
told Reuters: “They have to
pay for the crime. It is the
worst crime in the world.”
“Is the blood of our children
mere sewer water?”

Coffeeshop waiter Saad
Jouhar said: “Me and my
friends would have no pity
watching them die.” The six
denied infecting 426 children,
more than 50 of whom
have since died, with HIV at
a hospital in Benghazi city in
the late 1990s. (Reuters)
