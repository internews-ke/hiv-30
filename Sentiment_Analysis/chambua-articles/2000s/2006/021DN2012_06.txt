Libyan court today
found five Bulgarian
nurses and a Palestinian
doctor guilty of
infecting hundreds of
children with the
HIV virus that causes Aids and sentenced
them all to death.
The verdict and sentences were
announced by judge Mahmoud
Haouissa. The six are accused of
intentionally infecting 426 Libyan
children with HIV at a hospital in
Benghazi in the late 1990s. The
prosecution had demanded the
death penalty.
Meanwhile, in Sofia, Bulgaria
condemned the death sentences
against its nationals and the Palestinian
doctor.
Foreign Minister Ivailo Kalfin
called the decision “deeply disappointing.”
The Black Sea country’s
parliament urged the international
community to reject the court’s verdicts
and put pressure on Libya to
free the nurses.
Here is reaction by Mr
George Joffe, Maghreb expert, at
Cambridge University: “It was
absolutely predictable on political
ground and had nothing to do with
the facts of the case.”
“I’m not surprised. I think now
the real negotiations will begin, to
find a way either arranging compensation
for the families of the
infected children, or a pardon for
the nurses.” “There are two reasons
for this. Number one, it gives Gaddafi
a much better lever to force
negotiations for compensation, and
number two, it’s a way of appeasing
the families in Benghazi.”
“There will be a price to pay. It
depends on what the international
community is prepared to pay. But
that’s still not clear. It will be
almost certainly in the form of
humanitarian compensation.”
The medics, who deny the charges,
were convicted in a 2004 trial
and sentenced to death by firing
squad. But the Libyan supreme
court quashed the ruling last year
and ordered the case be returned to
a lower court. (Reuters)
