{"text": "\ufeffDAILY NATION Wednesday November 19, 2008\r\n\r\nMY DILEMMA\r\nAm I being paranoid about this friendship?\r\nNEXT WEEK\u2019S DILEMMA\r\nI am a 32-year-old woman from the Kikuyu\r\ncommunity. My boyfriend is 33 and he is\r\nfrom the Luhya community. We have\r\nbeen dating for quite some time now; I\r\ncare deeply about him and he says he cares\r\nabout me too.\r\nI have been hoping we could be married\r\nsoon, but there is a problem. My mother\u2019s\r\nsister is married to his father\u2019s brother.\r\nMy side of the family says it\u2019s okay for us\r\nto get married because we have no blood\r\nrelationship, but he tells me that according\r\nto Luhya customs we cannot get married\r\nbecause we are related through marriage.\r\nI really can\u2019t understand why not seeing\r\nas he and I share no blood relations. I am\r\nconfused and don\u2019t know what to do.\r\nShould I keep hoping that his family will\r\nunderstand or should I move on without\r\nhim? I really love him but I feel as though\r\nhe is just looking for an excuse to marry\r\nsomeone else. Please help.\r\n\u2018Caught in a Twist\u2019\r\nSend in your answers, before noon on\r\nFriday, to: The Editor, Living, P.O. Box\r\n49010, Nairobi, GPO 00100; e-mail:\r\nliving@nation.co.ke with \u201cMy Dilemma\u201d\r\nas the subject.\r\nREADERS SAY\r\nI am a 34-year-old man married to a lovely\r\nwoman who turned 29 two weeks ago. We\r\nhave two cute daughters aged four and two\r\nyears. Our initial two years of marriage were\r\nwonderful and we were very happy. But some\r\ntime last year my wife, who is a banker, formed\r\na friendship with a man at her workplace and\r\ntold me about it. With time, I started getting\r\nconcerned that they were becoming too\r\nclose as she was spending too much time\r\nwith him. They would even go out for drinks\r\nand she would tell me about it. Not wanting\r\nto be difficult or feel insecure, I gave her my\r\nblessings.\r\nLately, however, I can no longer stand it and I\r\ntold her to end the relationship because it was,\r\nin my view, no longer healthy. She has refused\r\nand says I\u2019m being insecure over nothing. I am\r\nnow in a dilemma regarding what to do about\r\nher defiance. I don\u2019t know whether or not she\r\nis cheating on me but I would be a fool not to\r\nsuspect something was going on. I care for my\r\nfamily and I don\u2019t want to end my marriage.\r\nPlease advise.\r\n\r\nYou must act now\r\nIt is an open secret that a large percentage of\r\nmarried people have intimate relationships\r\nwith colleagues at work. No man should\r\nallow his wife to go on a drinking spree with\r\nother men. While she may be innocent, the\r\nman involved is definitely up to something\r\nsinister. God gave you the license to be the\r\nhead of your family and your biggest task\r\nis to give direction. Sometimes we face\r\nserious challenges and we must make serious\r\ndecisions no matter who gets hurt. Such a\r\ntime is now, when you must tell your wife\r\nthat the relationship is over, and make sure\r\nshe understands that your decision is final.\r\nShe needs to be responsible and remember\r\nthat she is now a married woman, not a single\r\nteenager.\r\nThere are many ways of monitoring her\r\nmovements, and this might be necessary\r\nbefore you make a decision. Use tact to avoid\r\nmore trouble. You also need to look within\r\nyourself and find out whether or not your\r\nwife might be bored with you. Sometimes men\r\nmake the mistake of assuming that everything\r\nis okay, but a good sign of a satisfied woman\r\nis one who always wants to be with her\r\nhusband.\r\nYou need to act now. If you investigate and\r\nfind out she is cheating on you, let her go. It\r\nis better to lose your family than to go down\r\nwith Aids.\r\nJames Kioko Nzau, Nairobi"}
