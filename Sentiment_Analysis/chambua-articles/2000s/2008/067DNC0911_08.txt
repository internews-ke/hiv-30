ENDURING THE CHILL CLUB

About 3,000 Standard Seven
pupils from Nairobi and
Central provinces graduated
at the event. Those who
graduated are members of
‘Chill Clubs’ in their school.
The girls and boys marked
the day with song and dance,
poetry recitals and took
part in many other activities
geared towards teaching
them the importance
of working as a team.
There were essay-writing
competitions, too, in which
winners were rewarded and
the best schools recognised.
These activities made the
day really interesting for the
pupils.
The ‘Chill’ programme
targets children aged
between 12 and 15 years,
especially those in Class
Seven, both in Nairobi and
Central provinces. This
programme is club-based and
the clubs are called ‘Chill” clubs. It is
HIV prevention programme in schools
which seeks to create a generation of
youth who are highly empowered to
make informed decisions on both their
lives and their sexuality by imparting
the correct knowledge, skills and
attitude.
The ‘Chill’ Club vision is ‘to create
a generation of youth who are highly
empowered to make informed
decisions regarding their lives and
sexuality because they have the
correct knowledge, skills and right
attitude to do so within an enabling
environment.
Yvonne Agnes Nasiondo, 13, who
goes to City Pry School, Nairobi, said:
“I have learned a lot from the ‘Chill
Club’, particularly on various types
of relationships. I have also learned
how to be assertive and say no to bad
company. As the chairperson of peer
educators our school,
I am now able to help
my fellow school mates
solve their personal
problems. The lessons
I have learned from the
‘Chill Club’ will linger on
for a long time and are
no doubt very useful in
my life.”
And Eric Ochieng’,
one of those who
graduated, said: “One
of the important lessons
I have learned from the
‘Chill Club’ is how to avoid
getting infected with HIV.
I have now understood
that sex is not the same
thing as love. Secondly, I
have acquired important
social skills particularly
on relationships. As the
chairman of peer educators in
the school, I am able to apply
the various lessons I have
learned over the last one year
when counselling other pupils.”
The boys and girls who took
part at this unique event were
drawn from 35 public primary
schools in Nairobi and Central
provinces. The Standard Seven pupils
who graduated had been in the APHIA
II NC Chill Club programme for one
year.
The programme is implemented by
slightly older youth between ages18
and 25, commonly referred to as
‘Youth Leaders’ using the abstinence
messages. These volunteer youth
leaders are well trained on HIV/ AIDS
issues, facilitation skills and the ‘Chill’
curriculum topics. Each school has
a pair of youth leaders - male and
female- assigned to them. The youth
leaders visit each school once a week
on an agreed club day to facilitate
a ‘Chill’ session. The ‘Chill’ sessions
include life skills like assertiveness,
good decision making and abstinence
as well as important information about
gender and gender roles as well as
reproductive health.
The objectives include equipping
the youth with sufficient information
on HIV/ AIDS in order to curb the
spread of HIV/ AIDS, galvanize a youth
movement in primary schools which
promotes discussion and adoption of
sexual behaviours with special focus
on abstinence as a lifestyle choice.
The ‘Chill’ club fun days are
organized at the end of every year as
a graduation for the current ‘Chill’ club
members. The ‘Chill’ club members
get the opportunity to showcase
their talents to their peers and meet
members from other schools. It’s
also meant to appreciate them for
choosing abstinence as a lifestyle of
choice.
The programme, sponsored
by USAID, is a partnership of five
organizations which include Pathfinder
International, the project brings
together the Christian Children’s Fund
(CCF), Malteser International, the
Network of AIDS Researchers in East
and Southern Africa (NARESA) and
Population Services International (PSI)
in Nairobi and Central Provinces.
