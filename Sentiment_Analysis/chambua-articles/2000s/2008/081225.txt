{"text": "\ufeffDAILY NATION Thursday December 25, 2008\r\n\r\nAt last a reusable sanitary towel\r\n\r\nfacilities to help them\r\nmanage their periods,\r\nto the detriment of their academic\r\nachievement, adding that the reality\r\nhinders many disadvantaged girls\r\nfrom fully enjoying their right to\r\neducation.\r\nAccording to Mr Kiamba, the\r\nHuru idea came from the concern\r\nthat donating disposable sanitary\r\ntowels was not sustainable. \u201cWhat\r\nwill happen when we cannot supply\r\nthem anymore? The idea was to\r\ncreate something that was reusable,\r\nand which would be made available\r\nto young girls to help them stay in\r\nschool,\u201d he said.\r\nAnd, to develop the product,\r\nJohnson & Johnson worked with a\r\ncommunity-based programme, which,\r\ntogether with similar programmes,\r\nwould produce the pads that would\r\nbe made available to the girls at low\r\ncost \u2014 about half a dollar (about Sh40\r\napiece). The launch kit targeted 250\r\ngirls, Mr Kiamba said.\r\nPepfer\r\nThe US President\u2019s HIV/Aids Fund\r\n(Pepfar) is financing the initiative.\r\nThrough the fund, pads are bought\r\nand distributed free of charge to some\r\nof the poorest girls in the slums.\r\nThe distribution pack has six pads,\r\nthree underpants, a bar of soap, and an\r\ninsert with an HIV message.\r\nThe number of pads ensures that\r\nthe girl can wash and reuse the pads\r\nduring the menstrual cycle, \u201cand\r\nthen they are ready for the following\r\nmonth.\u201d The sanitary towel initiative\r\nis a double-barrelled gun against\r\nslum poverty. Apart from offering\r\nan affordable alternative to the\r\nregular disposable pads, the towels\r\nare manufactured by a slum-based\r\ncommunity programme, Mwechi\r\n\u2014 Mukuru Women Empowerment\r\nand Community Health Initiative \u2014 in\r\nMukuru, in Nairobi South B area.\r\nImprovement\r\nIt took \u201cclose to a year\u201d to develop\r\nthe product, Mr Kiamba says, adding,\r\nthe concept was borrowed from\r\nanother project that J&J supports in\r\nZambia. But the Kenyan product is\r\nan improvement on the Zambian one,\r\nhe explained. Mwechi women made it\r\nbetter, and more functional, besides\r\nbringing on board other partners,\u201d\r\nhe said.\r\nTalking to Horizon, Ms Veronica\r\nNthenya of Micato Tours, whose\r\nAmericaShare Kenya programme\r\nis working with the slum girls,\r\ndemonstrated how the pads are used.\r\nThey are in two sets \u2014 for day and for\r\nnight use \u2014 and are made from pure\r\ncotton.\r\nThe basic concept is that of the\r\nregular winged pad that is normally\r\npressed on the user\u2019s underpants. In\r\nthe case Huru, the adhesive wings have\r\nflat fasteners on either side to keep the\r\npad in place from beneath. The day\r\nand night pads are distinguishable\r\nboth by colour and by length.\r\nWhile Horizon could not establish\r\nthe exact number of targeted girls, Mr\r\nKiamba said the project was a model.\r\n\u201cWe would like the Mukuru experience\r\nto expand to more women\u2019s groups so\r\nthat they can learn to make the pads\r\nfor income-generation and at the same\r\ntime to help keep girls in school.\r\nLiberty\r\nOn \u2018Huru\u2019, Mr Kiamba said: \u201cThis is a\r\nSwahili word for freedom \u2014 liberty \u2014\r\nbecause that is what we want to give to\r\nthe women. We want to give the young\r\ngirls the liberty to stay in school, the\r\nliberty to be confident, the liberty\r\nnot to be ashamed about what is\r\nhappening to their bodies, the liberty\r\nto understand what is happening to\r\ntheir bodies, and therefore to be free\r\nand relieved to stay in school like all\r\nthe other children.\u201d\r\nBesides distributing the reusable\r\nsanitary towels, the initiative will\r\nbe used to spread health education\r\nmessages in Mukuru.\r\n\u201cOur health educators will be\r\ncoming there to talk to the girls about\r\nthe changes in their bodies, about HIV,\r\nand also to receive feedback on what\r\nthey have experienced in the use of\r\nthis product, and the challenges that\r\nthey have to overcome in its design.\r\nIt is anticipated that just as Mwechi\r\nimproved on the Zambian product,\r\nthe slum women will also improve on\r\nHuru. Mr Kiamba said: \u201cWe want to\r\nwork with the community to ensure\r\nthe product serves them. If they are\r\nfinding certain difficulties, then we\r\nwant to see what we can do.\u201d\r\n\u2014 DOROTHY KWEYU"}
