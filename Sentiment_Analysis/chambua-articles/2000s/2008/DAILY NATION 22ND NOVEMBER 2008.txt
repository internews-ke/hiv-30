There's hardly any place to hide from HIV

Abstinence and faithfulness to one uninfected
partner remain the the centrepieces of
many campaigns HIV and Aids
around the world. In Kenya, they are the
reason religious movements like Christianity
and Islam have joined the world as
progressive forces against HIV because of
the confluence between this message and
the theologies of these faiths.
The implied reward of abstinence is marriage
and a long life. The same is the case
for having one uninfected partner. The
launch ofthe documentary film, The Silent
partner: HIV in Marriage in Nairobi
this week is likely to shake the foundations
of this reward system in the future.
While maniage continues to be an important
social institution in Kenya with
two out of every three people between
15 and 64 years either married or-living
with a partner, it offers very little'protection against HIV. The testimonies on film
aside, at least one partner is living with
HIV in 10 per-cent of married couples.
only two thirds of Kenyan adults infected with
HIV say they are living in a union.
Only 3 per cent of Kenyans in a marriage
or a cohabitating arrangement reported
using condoms the last time they had sex,
according to thejoumal, Population and
Development Review:
Many ofthe issties around infection with
HIV in marriage arise from the power relations
between men and women. For as
long as women depend on men economically
and have little power over howto
run their lives, marriage not such as safe
place to take refuge from HIV: As fonner
nominated MP Njoki Ndung'u says in the
film, it appears thatwomen are property
passed on from ownership by the father
to the husband.
