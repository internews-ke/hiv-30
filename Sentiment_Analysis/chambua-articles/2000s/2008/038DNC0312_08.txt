Police exposed
to Aids risk

By MACHARIA MWANGI
Police officers are exposed to the risk
of HIV and Aids due to the nature
of their work, Administration Police
boss Kinuthia Mbugua has said.
“The risk of exposure to officers
handling emergencies such as accidents
cannot be overstated,” Mr
Mbugua said.
Speaking at the Administration
Police Training College in Naivasha
yesterday, the AP boss said lack of
adequate information remained the
main cause of stigma against those
living with the disease.
