Competent staff will\r\nbe employed to run them.\r\nMedical Services minister\r\nAnyang\u2019 Nyong\u2019o said yesterday\r\nthat the centres will now\r\noffer various medical tests so\r\nthat people can establish the\r\nstate of their health instead of\r\nexclusively establishing their\r\nHIV status.\r\n\u201cPeople wishing to know\r\ntheir blood sugar level, blood\r\npressure, among other diagnostic\r\ntests, will now be able\r\nto access such services at the\r\ncentres,\u2019\u2019 said the minister,\r\nwho was on a tour of Meru\r\nCentral District Hospital.\r\nSpeaking at Githongo District\r\nHospital in Imenti Central,\r\nthe minister said the\r\nmove to re-brand the centres\r\ncame after realisation that\r\nmost Kenyans abhor visiting\r\nthem because of the stigma\r\nassociated with HIV and Aids.\r\nMaking such centres offer\r\nother diagnostic tests, the\r\nminister added, would act as a\r\nmorale booster to those wishing\r\nto know their HIV status\r\nsince other people will not\r\nknow their exact mission.\r\nThe scourge\r\n\u201cMost Kenyans shun the centres\r\nsince they deal exclusively\r\nwith Aids and anybody visiting\r\nthem is invariably deemed to\r\nbe infected. This attitude has\r\nto change if the war against\r\nthe scourge is to be won,\u2019\u2019 said\r\nthe minister.\r\nThe minister said efforts to\r\ncheck the spread of Aids since\r\nits discovery over 20 years ago\r\nhave partly been hampered by\r\nthe stigma associated with the\r\ndisease, coupled with inappropriate\r\nstrategies.\r\n\u201cIt has now become imperative\r\nfor us to rethink our\r\nintervention strategies and\r\nremodel them to ensure the\r\neradication of the stigma associated\r\nwith the diseases,\u2019\u2019 the\r\nminister said."}
