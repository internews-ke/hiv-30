HIV testing
centres to be
more friendly

Centres for voluntary
counselling and testing
of HN and Aids
are set to undergo
major changes to make them
more friendly and effective in
the fight against the scourge.
They will be re-branded
as· "comprehensive care centres"
and will be adequately
equipped. Competent staff will
be employed to run them.
Medical Services minister
Anyang' Nyong'o said yesterday
that the centres will now
offer various medical tests so
that people can establish the
state of their health instead of
exclusively establishing their
HIV status.
"People wishing to know
their blood sugar level, blood
pressure, among other diag-
nostic tests, will now be able
to access such services at the
centres:' said the minister,
who was on a tour of Meru
Central District Hospital.
Speaking at Githongo District
Hospital in Imenti Central,
the minister said the
move to re-brand the centres'
came after realisatjon that
most Kenyans abhor visiting
them because of the stigma
associated withHNand Aids.
Making such centres offer
other diagnostic tests. the
minister added, would act as a
morale booster to those wishing
to know their HIV status
since other people will not
know their exact mission.
Thescourge
"Most Kenyans shun the centres
since they deal exclusively
with Aids and anybody visiting
them is invariably deemed to .
be infected. This attitude has
to change if the war against
the scourge is to be won;' said
the mirnister.
The minister said efforts to
check the spread ofAids since
its discovery over 20 years ago
have partly been hampered by
the stigtna associated with the
disease, coupled with inappropriate
strategies.
It has now become imperative for us to 'rethink our
intervention strategies and
remodel them to ensure the
eradication ofthe stigma associated
with the diseases the
minister said.
