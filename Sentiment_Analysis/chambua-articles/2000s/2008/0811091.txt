Yet this is\r\nan important stage. And, for teenagers,\r\nthis is the reality of their existence.\r\nThus, a novel addressing teenage romance\r\nis likely to resonate with the\r\nyouth, especially those in secondary\r\nschool. Stephen Mugambi must have had\r\nthis audience in mind when he wrote his\r\ntwo books, Wait for me Angela and Walk\r\nwith me Angela.\r\nThe two books are mostly set at Kilimambogo\r\nSecondary School, a mixed\r\nboarding school in Eastern Province. Ben\r\nWangu is smitten with a girl in his class\r\ncalled Angela Mueni.\r\nHe decides to do everything he can to\r\nwin Angela\u2019s heart. It is not smooth sailing\r\nfor Wangu as he starts off on the wrong\r\nfooting with her, literally. He gets punished\r\nfor tripping on the girl. To Angela,\r\nWangu is a malicious boy to be avoided\r\nat all costs.\r\nGirl of his dreams\r\nNot one to give up easily, Wangu embarks\r\non a mission to woo the girl of his dreams.\r\nHe soon realises that nothing short of a\r\nsincere apology will make Angela see him\r\nin a different light.\r\nWhile the apology pays dividends for\r\nWangu, it should be looked at from a\r\nwider perspective. Bearing in mind that\r\nthese books are read by the youth, the\r\nmessage from the author here is that\r\nbeing apologetic whenever one is wrong\r\ncan cover a multitude of wrongs.\r\nThis is especially so when viewed from\r\nthe perspective of the recent wave unrest\r\nin schools. A lot of grief and damage\r\nwould have been avoided had the students\r\nembraced a spirit of honesty, remorse and\r\nforgiveness.\r\nAngela does her part and forgives\r\nWangu, and soon a romance starts to blossom\r\nbetween the two. If Wangu thought\r\nthat being in a romantic relationship was\r\ngoing to be easy, then he was in for a rude\r\nshock.\r\nFor one he has to reckon with Sandra,\r\nAngela\u2019s best friend, who harbours deepseated\r\nsuspicions about him. She is yet to\r\nbe convinced that Wangu is a changed\r\nperson. She is thus prepared to go to any\r\nlength to separate the two.\r\nMany high school students and teachers\r\nwill tell you that boy/girl relationships are\r\nactively discouraged by school adminis-\r\nBook sequel deals\r\nwith matter of growing\r\nup, initiation into\r\nadulthood and HIV\r\ntrations. By deciding\r\nto write about such a sensitive topic, the\r\nauthor opts not to bury his head in the\r\nsand by pretending that these relationships\r\ndo not take place.\r\nThe challenge, therefore, is for him to\r\ntell his story without appearing to put\r\nideas into the readers\u2019 minds. And this\r\nhe does admirably. To prove that he\u2019s really\r\nworthy of Angela\u2019s attention, Wangu\r\nhas to first of all discard his bad ways and\r\nwork extra hard in his class work.\r\nAt some point, Sandra challenges Angela\r\nto tell her how \u201cfar\u201d she is willing to\r\ngo with the relationship. This is in clear\r\nreference to sex. The author is alive to the\r\nfact that many teenagers are likely to experiment\r\nwith sex.\r\nIt is this experimentation that has led\r\nto unwanted pregnancies and spread\r\nof HIV/Aids. The author provides more\r\nchecks and balances when he brings in the\r\nguidance and counselling teacher.\r\nThe teacher, who has by now learnt\r\nof the relationship, summons the two,\r\nseparately, and makes it known that the\r\ntwo lovebirds will be under her watchful\r\neyes.\r\nWhile on a weekly outing, Wangu visits\r\na bookshop in Machakos town and\r\nthere he meets Tressah, a beautiful girl\r\nwho served him at the counter; she turns\r\nout to be the owner\u2019s daughter. Tressah is\r\nwaiting to join the University of Nairobi\r\nfor her Law degree.\r\nSoon, their friendship grows and, although\r\nthe author does not tell us how\r\nTressah feels about Wangu, we know\r\nthat Wangu has some romantic feelings\r\nfor her.\r\nWangu entertains the possibility of having\r\na relationship behind Angela\u2019s back.\r\nBut thanks to Kigotho, one of their\r\nclassmates, Angela gets to know that\r\nWangu went to Nairobi to visit the other\r\ngirl at the university. With the help of his\r\nfriend, Patrick Mbaja, Wangu had lied to\r\nAngela that he had gone to the university\r\nto visit a cousin.\r\nDeeply angered\r\nAngela is deeply angered by Wangu\u2019s betrayal\r\nand decides to end the relationship.\r\nEventually, though, the two make up but\r\nnot before Angela gives Wangu a piece of\r\nher mind.\r\nIn a strange twist of fate, Kigotho is\r\nhit by a speeding vehicle just outside the\r\nschool gate, and dies.\r\nBy exposing Wangu\u2019s secret, Kigotho\r\ndid show selfish motives, but one cannot\r\ndeny that he did the right thing. So the\r\nquestion raised in the reader\u2019s mind is: by\r\ngetting rid of Kigotho, is the author trying\r\nto show solidarity with Wangu?\r\nAll in all, the author must be commended\r\nfor maintaining interest throughout\r\nthe course of the story in the two books.\r\nAnd even though Walk with me Angela is\r\na sequel to Wait for me Angela, the author\r\nhas effectively made sure that each book\r\ncan be read on its own.\r\nWait for me Angela won the second\r\nprize in the inaugural Wahome Mutahi\r\nPrize for Literature in 2006.\r\njngunjiri@nation.co.ke"}
