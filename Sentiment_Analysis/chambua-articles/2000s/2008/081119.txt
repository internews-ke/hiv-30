{"text": "\ufeffWednesday November 19, 2008 DAILY NATION\r\n\r\nLIVING POSITIVELY\r\nHealing isn\u2019t one of them; rather,\r\nI need to be able to look after\r\nthose whose needs would make a\r\ndifference if only they were met\r\nI know this is hard to believe, but when I look back, I feel the\r\nbest thing that ever happened to me was getting infected with\r\nHIV. This virus has taught me a lot about courage, friendship,\r\nand practically everything else I know about life. Why do I say\r\nthis? Because many are the times in my line of work, or even in\r\nmy social life, when I have met people who have the \u2018answers\u2019 to\r\nmy problems.\r\n\u201cAsunta, I know of a pastor who can pray for you to be\r\nhealed,\u201d they will say, while extolling the amazing healing\r\npowers of the pastor.\r\nCorrection: I am not a victim. I hate that label. I am simply\r\nliving with HIV, period. Victim implies a helplessness; that I\u2019m\r\nat the mercy of this virus. Truth is, I\u2019m living my life to the\r\nfullest, like any victor would. I don\u2019t doubt that God can heal. It\r\nis possible. However, one thing I now know for sure is that even\r\nif I were healed today, it would not change any part of my life\r\nbecause I made a conscious decision two decades ago to live\r\npositively.\r\n\u201cI really don\u2019t have a problem,\u201d I categorically told one lady\r\nwho was on my case, believing that she was doing me the\r\nbiggest favour in the world. I wish people would see that there\r\nare more pressing matters that need prayers.\r\nMeant to be\r\nI don\u2019t know about you, but I think this was meant to be. God\r\nmeant for me to get infected so He could use me. Sometimes I\r\ntry to imagine what my life would be like if I were HIV-negative,\r\nand I draw a blank. That\u2019s because I have lived all my adult life\r\nwith this virus, and I think I would literally have to take a crash\r\ncourse in living without HIV if I woke up tomorrow and found\r\nmyself HIV-negative.\r\nLet\u2019s talk about miracles. Right now I have over 400 orphans\r\nand vulnerable children who need school fees. And if I don\u2019t do\r\nsomething real quick, they won\u2019t see the inside of a classroom\r\nnext year. I wish these \u2018concerned\u2019 folks would pray so I could get\r\nmiracles for everyday stuff like this. The world doesn\u2019t start and\r\nend with me. It\u2019s not only about Asunta. I\u2019m just a cog, albeit a\r\nvisible one.\r\nWith all due respect, I wish that pastor I\u2019m being told to go\r\nand see about a miracle healing would pray so that my orphans\r\ncould find decent shelter and three square meals a day. I wish\r\nthere was a miracle so I could have salaries for my 100-plus staff\r\nwho care for people living with HIV.\r\n\u201cMy problem is not actually my HIV status, but the way the\r\nsociety reacts to those who are infected,\u201d I politely told the lady\r\nwho was giving me directions to the faith healer\u2019s haunt.\r\nI\u2019m thankful for the concern coming from all these wellmeaning\r\npeople. But I\u2019ve said this before and I\u2019ll say it again:\r\nimmediately after I tested HIV-positive, I spent a lot of time\r\nrushing from one healing crusade to another. \u201cGod, I swear if\r\nyou heal me I will serve you for the rest of my life,\u201d I bargained\r\nwith the Almighty.\r\nStrange towns\r\nSometimes I found myself in strange towns, and penniless,\r\nbecause I had heard that a miracle healer was coming from\r\noverseas and he had an \u201cimpressive healing resume\u201d.\r\nAfter a while, I learned to accept my status and asked God to\r\nuse me the way I am. I was healed of one ill, though: foolishness. I\r\nlearned that God works on His own terms.\r\nMost of the people who are on the outside looking in think\r\nthat if I\u2019m somehow rid of this virus, I will have a \u2018normal\u2019 life.\r\nWhat they don\u2019t know is I\u2019m actually living a normal life right\r\nnow. HIV may have grabbed hold of a part of my immunity, but\r\nI\u2019m still in life\u2019s driving seat. And that\u2019s what is important.\r\nI do need miracles in my life, just not the ones people think.\r\nFor instance, could someone please pray that we would see an\r\nend to the bottlenecks that sometimes mean people who are\r\nliving with HIV have a hard time accessing treatment?\r\nI also wish someone would pray and move the mountain that\r\nis the relevant authorities so that they can put their money\r\nwhere their mouth is, especially with regards to basic things that\r\nmean life and death for women and children living with HIV.\r\nI\u2019m not done yet: I wish all Christians would practise what\r\nthey preach because, there are thousands of bed-ridden folks\r\nwho will die unless someone \u2013 read, that church-going Christian\r\nneighbour \u2013 gets to them on time with a mug of porridge, or\r\neven just a shoulder to lean on. Those are the miracles I need to\r\nsee working in my life.\r\nasuntawagura@hotmail.com\r\nLIVING POSITIVELY\r\nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother of two who\r\ntested positive 20 years ago.
