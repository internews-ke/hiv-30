Like all\r\nviruses, it hijacks cells in its\r\nvictims, forcing them to be~\r\ncome little viral factories and\r\nmake more viruses.\r\nIn the face ofour engineered\r\nassassin cells, the virns will either\r\ndie or be forced to change\r\nits disguises again, weakening\r\nitself along the way;' added\r\nAndy Sewell of Britain's Cardiff\r\nUniversity. Perhaps having\r\nto mutate will weaken the\r\nvirus, the researchers said.\r\n(Reuters)"}
