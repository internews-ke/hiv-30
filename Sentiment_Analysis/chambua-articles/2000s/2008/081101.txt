Otherwise we\r\nhave until January 21 to submit proposals\r\nfor Round 9,\u201d she said.\r\nShe said it was premature to say that\r\nKenya should not apply for another round\r\nof funding, contradicting Medical Services\r\ncounterpart Prof Anyang Nyong\u2019o who\r\nearly this week called for an immediate\r\nsuspension of the Round 9 proposals.\r\n\u201cWe cannot suspend the proposals for\r\nfunding as it would spell doom for crucial\r\nhealth programmes,\u201d she said.\r\nBillions of dollars\r\nThe meeting with the Global Fund comes\r\nagainst the backdrop of a recommendation\r\nby the Global Fund\u2019s technical review\r\npanel that Kenya\u2019s proposal for the Round\r\n8 funding be rejected, saying billions of\r\ndollars are unaccounted for.\r\nThe final decision, however, lies with\r\nthe Fund\u2019s board of directors which meets\r\nthis month.\r\nAbout 230,000 Kenyans are on antiretroviral\r\ntherapy with the HIV prevalence\r\nrate standing at 7.8 per cent. Malaria is\r\nresponsible for 16,000 deaths annually\r\nwhile Kenya is ranked 13 among 32 countries\r\nwith a high TB burden. There has\r\nbeen an alarming increase in the disease,\r\nwhich claims 70 lives daily.\r\nA high-powered team is preparing for\r\na meeting with the Global Fund where it\r\nis expected to argue Kenya\u2019s case to be allowed\r\nto submit further proposals for the\r\ngrant.\r\nThe meeting, Ms Mugo said, will clear\r\nthe air on the funding.\r\nAnd as part of the preparations, the\r\nminister yesterday set up a taskforce to\r\nlook at the areas of concern and submit a\r\nreport in seven days.\r\nThe taskforce will investigate why\r\nKenya failed to give the Global Fund the\r\nrequired information during submission\r\nof the Round 8 proposals.\r\nWas at pains\r\nThe team is expected to review the status\r\nof the programmes funded under the\r\ngrant, their cost and financing as well as\r\nstatus of supporting documents.\r\nTaskforce members are representatives\r\nfrom the various departments that handle\r\nmoney from the Global Fund.\r\nTheir mandate is to review audit reports,\r\nidentify any outstanding issues and\r\nprepare an appropriate response that the\r\nKenyan delegation will present.\r\n\u201cThe Global Fund has not said any\r\nmoney has been misappropriated. This\r\nteam will therefore establish if any money\r\nhas been lost. If so where, how and how\r\nmuch? The problem could even lie with\r\npoor documentation,\u201d Ms Mugo said.\r\nThe minister was at pains to explain\r\nthat the taskforce was not an investigating\r\nbody.\r\n\u201cThe taskforce will only seek information\r\nfrom people who were responsible for\r\nthe fund, which is different from a probe,\u201d\r\nshe said."}
