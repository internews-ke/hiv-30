This\r\nprogramme is club-based and\r\nthe clubs are called \u2018Chill\u201d clubs. It is\r\nHIV prevention programme in schools\r\nwhich seeks to create a generation of\r\nyouth who are highly empowered to\r\nmake informed decisions on both their\r\nlives and their sexuality by imparting\r\nthe correct knowledge, skills and\r\nattitude.\r\nThe \u2018Chill\u2019 Club vision is \u2018to create\r\na generation of youth who are highly\r\nempowered to make informed\r\ndecisions regarding their lives and\r\nsexuality because they have the\r\ncorrect knowledge, skills and right\r\nattitude to do so within an enabling\r\nenvironment.\r\nYvonne Agnes Nasiondo, 13, who\r\ngoes to City Pry School, Nairobi, said:\r\n\u201cI have learned a lot from the \u2018Chill\r\nClub\u2019, particularly on various types\r\nof relationships. I have also learned\r\nhow to be assertive and say no to bad\r\ncompany. As the chairperson of peer\r\neducators our school,\r\nI am now able to help\r\nmy fellow school mates\r\nsolve their personal\r\nproblems. The lessons\r\nI have learned from the\r\n\u2018Chill Club\u2019 will linger on\r\nfor a long time and are\r\nno doubt very useful in\r\nmy life.\u201d\r\nAnd Eric Ochieng\u2019,\r\none of those who\r\ngraduated, said: \u201cOne\r\nof the important lessons\r\nI have learned from the\r\n\u2018Chill Club\u2019 is how to avoid\r\ngetting infected with HIV.\r\nI have now understood\r\nthat sex is not the same\r\nthing as love. Secondly, I\r\nhave acquired important\r\nsocial skills particularly\r\non relationships. As the\r\nchairman of peer educators in\r\nthe school, I am able to apply\r\nthe various lessons I have\r\nlearned over the last one year\r\nwhen counselling other pupils.\u201d\r\nThe boys and girls who took\r\npart at this unique event were\r\ndrawn from 35 public primary\r\nschools in Nairobi and Central\r\nprovinces. The Standard Seven pupils\r\nwho graduated had been in the APHIA\r\nII NC Chill Club programme for one\r\nyear.\r\nThe programme is implemented by\r\nslightly older youth between ages18\r\nand 25, commonly referred to as\r\n\u2018Youth Leaders\u2019 using the abstinence\r\nmessages. These volunteer youth\r\nleaders are well trained on HIV/ AIDS\r\nissues, facilitation skills and the \u2018Chill\u2019\r\ncurriculum topics. Each school has\r\na pair of youth leaders - male and\r\nfemale- assigned to them. The youth\r\nleaders visit each school once a week\r\non an agreed club day to facilitate\r\na \u2018Chill\u2019 session. The \u2018Chill\u2019 sessions\r\ninclude life skills like assertiveness,\r\ngood decision making and abstinence\r\nas well as important information about\r\ngender and gender roles as well as\r\nreproductive health.\r\nThe objectives include equipping\r\nthe youth with sufficient information\r\non HIV/ AIDS in order to curb the\r\nspread of HIV/ AIDS, galvanize a youth\r\nmovement in primary schools which\r\npromotes discussion and adoption of\r\nsexual behaviours with special focus\r\non abstinence as a lifestyle choice.\r\nThe \u2018Chill\u2019 club fun days are\r\norganized at the end of every year as\r\na graduation for the current \u2018Chill\u2019 club\r\nmembers. The \u2018Chill\u2019 club members\r\nget the opportunity to showcase\r\ntheir talents to their peers and meet\r\nmembers from other schools. It\u2019s\r\nalso meant to appreciate them for\r\nchoosing abstinence as a lifestyle of\r\nchoice.\r\nThe programme, sponsored\r\nby USAID, is a partnership of five\r\norganizations which include Pathfinder\r\nInternational, the project brings\r\ntogether the Christian Children\u2019s Fund\r\n(CCF), Malteser International, the\r\nNetwork of AIDS Researchers in East\r\nand Southern Africa (NARESA) and\r\nPopulation Services International (PSI)\r\nin Nairobi and Central Provinces.\r\n\u00abPg 1\r\nAbove: Children dance\r\nduring this year\u2019s\r\ngraduation ceremony of\r\nmore than 3,000 \u2018Chill\r\nClub\u2019 members at City\r\nPrimary School, Nairobi, last\r\nweekend.\r\nBelow: Eric Ochieng\u2019, the\r\nchairman of peer educators\r\nin his school, City Primary,\r\nand one of those who\r\ngraduated."}
