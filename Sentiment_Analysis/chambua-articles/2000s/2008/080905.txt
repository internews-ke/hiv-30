{"text": "\ufeffDAILY NATION WEDNESDAY AUGUST 5, 2009\r\nLIVING POSITIVELY\r\n\r\nOur future leaders know all about\r\nHIV, but they\u2019re making the \u2018free\r\nlove\u2019 generation of the 1960s look\r\nlike saints\r\nWhat in the world do you do when your condom bursts in\r\nthe middle of a one-night stand with a total stranger?\r\nAnd what if this happens while your live-in girlfriend is\r\nsitting at home, pregnant with your child, you\u2019re still in college\r\nand your whole family is looking to you to give them a brighter\r\nfuture? And what if you also have a problem with substance\r\nabuse and staying faithful to your partner?\r\nThese are some of the tough questions that confronted me\r\nwhen I went to speak about positive living to college youths.\r\nI could hardly believe some of the things I was hearing and\r\nstruggled to keep a straight face because that\u2019s what a counsellor\r\nis supposed to do. Any show of anger or disgust and your client\r\nwill be out of the place quicker than you can say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\r\nIt seems like all the work we\u2019ve done on the ground over the\r\nyears about HIV awareness has fallen on deaf ears. How else\r\ncan I explain the issues that were raised that day? Either that, or\r\npeople truly believe they can never be infected with HIV until the\r\nmoment they actually test positive. It\u2019s sad because all the road\r\nsigns are still as visible as they\u2019ve always been: you can\u2019t drive\r\ndangerously on the road of life and expect to come out without a\r\nsingle scratch, even if you\u2019re the cat with the proverbial nine lives.\r\n\u201cKufa dereva, kufa gari,\u201d I once overheard a young man saying.\r\nWhen I asked, I was told the Kiswahili remark meant something\r\nto the effect that when a car is involved in a terrible accident, it\r\nis highly likely that the driver will die and his car be written off.\r\nIn this case, the young man was the reckless \u2018driver\u2019 who had\r\nunprotected sex with multiple sex partners. If he happens to be\r\ninfected, then so will his web of partners. Talk about throwing all\r\ncaution to the wind!\r\n\u2018Free love\u2019\r\nThis is what we\u2019re now faced with; a new generation of future\r\nleaders who know all about HIV, but who are making the \u2018free\r\nlove\u2019 generation of the 1960s look like saints. Nothing makes\r\nme more concerned than speaking to a group of youths on\r\nresponsible choices until I run out of saliva \u2013 only to learn that\r\nthey haven\u2019t put my counsel to any use.\r\nA VCT colleague tells me she goes through the same thing:\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve realised that once some young people test HIV-negative,\r\nthey take it as a certificate to engage in risky behaviour,\u201d she\r\nsays. \u201cThey think they\u2019re infallible, but the next time they come\r\nfor a test, they discover just how vulnerable they are.\u201d\r\nI\u2019ll tell the youth who are living dangerously what I wish\r\nsomeone had told me: living with HIV isn\u2019t easy. Even if you don\u2019t\r\nsuffer from opportunistic infections, and your CD4 count is\r\n1000, this virus still has a way of freaking you out. It messes with\r\nyour mind, convincing you that you cannot do stuff you would\r\notherwise excel in. It makes you afraid of life. You hide from\r\npeople, including yourself. This virus gives you sleepless nights\r\nbecause you\u2019re constantly worried about your future.\r\nI\u2019m 43 now, and have lived with HIV for 23 years, which is the\r\naverage age of the youths I talk to about the virus. And whenever\r\nI talk to them, I see myself two decades ago \u2013 but without\r\nanyone to tell me the things I\u2019m now telling them. Today\u2019s young\r\npeople are bombarded with responsible living messages from all\r\navenues, but the opposite is also true: they\u2019re being bombarded\r\nwith as many messages about irresponsible living.\r\nFragile age\r\nWould I have taken heed had I been HIV-educated 23 years ago?\r\nI don\u2019t know. And that\u2019s because I recognise that 20-something\r\nis a fragile age. There\u2019s peer pressure, newfound independence\r\nand the urge to try new things and fit in. What I do know is that\r\nthese are dangerous times and they call for cautious measures\r\nregarding the choices our children make.\r\nMy son, Peter, is a young adult and I worry about him despite\r\nhis having the facts at his fingertips. As I have counselled people\r\nI\u2019ve come to learn that irresponsible behaviour is like a chain\r\n\u2013 one wrong choice leads to another. It may start with a burst\r\ncondom, which will lead a frightened youth to a VCT, where he\r\nwill find he is still HIV-negative, and think he\u2019s invincible. My\r\nfriends and I say such a person is bound to go back to poke the\r\nhornet\u2019s nest even after surviving several scares. As a counsellor\r\nand the mother of a young adult, my mind never rests. I am\r\nconstantly praying that my son will make the right choices.\r\nasuntawagura@hotmail.com\r\nDangerous living\r\namong the youth\r\nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother of two who tested\r\npositive 23 years ago. She is the executive director of the Kenya\r\nNetwork of Women with Aids (KENWA)."}
