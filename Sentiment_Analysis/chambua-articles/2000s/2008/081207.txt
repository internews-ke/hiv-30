{"text": "\ufeffDecember 7, 2008 SUNDAY NATION\r\n\r\nBridge between patients and practice\r\nC E L LU L A R PHON E S\r\nBy SAM WAMBUGU\r\nAs we celebrate the\r\n20th World Aids Day\r\nthis month, we need\r\nnew and effective approaches\r\nto the public health\r\nchallenges in the war against\r\nHIV/Aids.\r\nThe world has 33 million\r\npeople living with the virus,\r\nmaking it one of the most destructive\r\nepidemics in recorded\r\nhistory.\r\nOver the past 10 years, the\r\nreach of mobile telephones has\r\nincreased, making the mobile\r\nphone the most common tool\r\nin the hands of the common\r\nman. It can therefore be used\r\nto put brakes on the spread of\r\nHIV/Aids.\r\nPersonal statements\r\nThink about the ringtones in\r\nour phones. They have become\r\nsuch personal statements that\r\nsome countries such as India\r\nhave specially created them to\r\npass messages in a fun way.\r\nThe BBC World Service\r\nTrust, the charitable arm of\r\nthe British Broadcasting Corporation,\r\nhas been running a\r\npublic health campaign and\r\nhas now launched a condom\r\nringtone to make clear the\r\nmessage that \u201csmart men use\r\ncondoms.\u201d\r\nThe condom ringtone was\r\nlaunched in August and in\r\nonly four months 660,000\r\npeople had downloaded it to\r\ntheir phones.\r\nHere is one scene, played\r\nout at a wedding in India: a\r\nmobile buzzes with a loud\r\nrefrain, \u201ccondom! condom!\u201d\r\nThe BBC Trust writes: \u201cEmbarrassing\r\nfor the person\r\nholding the mobile phone?\r\nNot a bit of it \u2013 the reaction\r\nof those around the red-faced\r\nman is to see him as smart and\r\nresponsible.\u201d If you also want\r\nto be like him, here is the link:\r\nwww.condomcondom.org.\r\nCall-back messages\r\nIn South Africa, a project\r\ndubbed \u201cProject M\u201d seeks\r\nto address HIV/Aids with\r\na number of different approaches\r\nusing the mobile\r\nphone. The project is built\r\naround the use of call-back\r\nmessages, delivering about 1\r\nmillion HIV/Aids and TB messages\r\neach day, for one year,\r\nto the public, piggybacking\r\non the free, widely used form\r\nof SMS called Please Call Me\r\n(PCM).\r\nEach sent PCM message has\r\nthe words \u201cPlease Call Me,\u201d\r\nthe phone number of the caller,\r\nand space for an additional\r\n120 characters. The extra space\r\nis normally filled with advertising,\r\nwhich helps offset the\r\ncost of running the service.\r\nTrained operators provide\r\ncallers with accurate health\r\ncare information, counselling\r\nand referrals to local testing\r\nclinics. The project also seeks\r\nto implement \u201cvirtual call centres,\u201d\r\nwhere existing help lines\r\nwill be staffed by teams of\r\ntrained HIV-positive patients\r\nto field questions, remotely\r\nvia their mobile phones, from\r\nthe public. These lay counsellors\r\nare knowledgeable about\r\nthe illness, diligent about\r\ntheir treatment regimens, and\r\nfamiliar with the stigma and\r\ndespair that a positive diagnosis\r\ncan cause.\r\nHere in Kenya, a project\r\nknown as Phones-for-Health\r\nfeaturing a mobile phonebased\r\ninformation system,\r\nis in the pilot-testing stage.\r\nThe software is loaded onto\r\na standard handset, which\r\nwill allow health care workers\r\nin the field to enter critical\r\nhealth information into a central\r\ndatabase in real time. The\r\ndata will be transmitted either\r\nusing a standard GPRS mobile\r\nconnection or an SMS channel.\r\nThe development of 3G wireless\r\ntechnology holds further\r\npromise in the fight against\r\nHIV.\r\nTo fast-track health care\r\ndelivery in Kenya, a wireless\r\nhealth care programme has\r\nbeen launched to improve efficiency\r\nin anti-retroviral drugs\r\ndistribution, which has been a\r\nserious challenge.\r\nThe project, known as the\r\nWireless Reach Kenya Partnership,\r\nwas developed by Research\r\nTriangle International.\r\nIt will enable doctors to collect\r\nvital information on patients,\r\nincluding their viral loads,\r\nand identify the patients lost\r\nto follow-up for better management.\r\nAlthough being implemented\r\non a small scale, this initiative\r\nholds hope for both patients\r\nand health managers.\r\nIgnorant of disease\r\nUganda has an innovative\r\nprogramme that uses text\r\nmessages as an interactive\r\ntool in improving HIV/Aids\r\nawareness and education. The\r\nproject, Text to Change, uses\r\ncell phones to promote HIV/\r\nAids knowledge, especially\r\namong the youth who are ignorant\r\nof the disease, by creating\r\ndialogue that will increase\r\nawareness of HIV and reduce\r\nstigma and discrimination.\r\nBut some countries are\r\nusing technology to undo\r\nsome of the gains made in\r\nfighting HIV-related stigma.\r\nIn Indonesia, for example,\r\npoliticians are planning to\r\ntag all HIV/Aids patients with\r\nradio frequency identification\r\nchips. They want to monitor\r\nand identify people who had\r\nshown \u201cactive sexual behaviour\u201d.\r\nAmid protests, a bylaw on\r\nHIV/Aids is about to be passed\r\nthat includes a controversial\r\narticle requiring certain\r\npeople living with HIV to be\r\nimplanted with a microchip.\r\nOnce a patient is found to have\r\ninfected a healthy person, they\r\nwill be punished. Critics have\r\ntermed it a narrow-minded\r\napproach.\r\nThe writer is a monitoring\r\nand evaluation specialist.\r\nsmawambugu@gmail.com\r\nCellular phones\r\ncan be used by\r\nhealth care workers\r\nin the field\r\nto enter critical\r\nhealth information\r\ninto a central\r\ndatabase.
