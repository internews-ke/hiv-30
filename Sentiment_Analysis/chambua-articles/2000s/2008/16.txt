ASSASSIN CELLS KEY TO FIGHT HIV AIDS

Aids vaccine said it prevented
infection in six monkeys.
The animals were infected
with a monkey version ofHN
called SN, and the vaccine
used a virus that is dangerous
to use in humans, so it is not
ready for human tests.
But, writing in the journal
Nature, Dr Dan Barouch of
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Centre and Harvard Medical
School in Boston and colleagues
said it shows there is
still hope for developing a vaccine
against Aids.
The virus, which infects- 33
million people globally,
Number of people who are
infected with Aids globally
pecially hard to tight. Like all
viruses, it hijacks cells in its
victims, forcing them to be~
come little viral factories and
make more viruses.
In the face ofour engineered
assassin cells, the virns will either
die or be forced to change
its disguises again, weakening
itself along the way;' added
Andy Sewell of Britain's Cardiff
University. Perhaps having
to mutate will weaken the
virus, the researchers said.
