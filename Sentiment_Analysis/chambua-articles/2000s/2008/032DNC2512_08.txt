At last a reusable sanitary towel

facilities to help them
manage their periods,
to the detriment of their academic
achievement, adding that the reality
hinders many disadvantaged girls
from fully enjoying their right to
education.
According to Mr Kiamba, the
Huru idea came from the concern
that donating disposable sanitary
towels was not sustainable. “What
will happen when we cannot supply
them anymore? The idea was to
create something that was reusable,
and which would be made available
to young girls to help them stay in
school,” he said.
And, to develop the product,
Johnson & Johnson worked with a
community-based programme, which,
together with similar programmes,
would produce the pads that would
be made available to the girls at low
cost — about half a dollar (about Sh40
apiece). The launch kit targeted 250
girls, Mr Kiamba said.
Pepfer
The US President’s HIV/Aids Fund
(Pepfar) is financing the initiative.
Through the fund, pads are bought
and distributed free of charge to some
of the poorest girls in the slums.
The distribution pack has six pads,
three underpants, a bar of soap, and an
insert with an HIV message.
The number of pads ensures that
the girl can wash and reuse the pads
during the menstrual cycle, “and
then they are ready for the following
month.” The sanitary towel initiative
is a double-barrelled gun against
slum poverty. Apart from offering
an affordable alternative to the
regular disposable pads, the towels
are manufactured by a slum-based
community programme, Mwechi
— Mukuru Women Empowerment
and Community Health Initiative — in
Mukuru, in Nairobi South B area.
Improvement
It took “close to a year” to develop
the product, Mr Kiamba says, adding,
the concept was borrowed from
another project that J&J supports in
Zambia. But the Kenyan product is
an improvement on the Zambian one,
he explained. Mwechi women made it
better, and more functional, besides
bringing on board other partners,”
he said.
Talking to Horizon, Ms Veronica
Nthenya of Micato Tours, whose
AmericaShare Kenya programme
is working with the slum girls,
demonstrated how the pads are used.
They are in two sets — for day and for
night use — and are made from pure
cotton.
The basic concept is that of the
regular winged pad that is normally
pressed on the user’s underpants. In
the case Huru, the adhesive wings have
flat fasteners on either side to keep the
pad in place from beneath. The day
and night pads are distinguishable
both by colour and by length.
While Horizon could not establish
the exact number of targeted girls, Mr
Kiamba said the project was a model.
“We would like the Mukuru experience
to expand to more women’s groups so
that they can learn to make the pads
for income-generation and at the same
time to help keep girls in school.
Liberty
On ‘Huru’, Mr Kiamba said: “This is a
Swahili word for freedom — liberty —
because that is what we want to give to
the women. We want to give the young
girls the liberty to stay in school, the
liberty to be confident, the liberty
not to be ashamed about what is
happening to their bodies, the liberty
to understand what is happening to
their bodies, and therefore to be free
and relieved to stay in school like all
the other children.”
Besides distributing the reusable
sanitary towels, the initiative will
be used to spread health education
messages in Mukuru.
“Our health educators will be
coming there to talk to the girls about
the changes in their bodies, about HIV,
and also to receive feedback on what
they have experienced in the use of
this product, and the challenges that
they have to overcome in its design.
It is anticipated that just as Mwechi
improved on the Zambian product,
the slum women will also improve on
Huru. Mr Kiamba said: “We want to
work with the community to ensure
the product serves them. If they are
finding certain difficulties, then we
want to see what we can do.”
