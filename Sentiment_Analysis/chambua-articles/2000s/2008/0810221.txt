{"text": "\ufeffDAILY NATION Wednesday October 22, 2008\r\n\r\nLETTERS\r\nInspirational courage\r\nI read your story titled \u201cA\r\nruthless disease that changes\r\nyour whole life\u201d last week.\r\nPatrick Mageria and Elizabeth\r\nRagui, the two breast cancer\r\nsurvivors, are such an\r\ninspiration to me. How I wish\r\nI had the courage to look at\r\nlife so positively, especially in\r\nview of their conditions. I am\r\nscheduled for an operation to\r\ndetect whether the lump in my\r\nbreast contains cancerous cells.\r\nMy prayer is that regardless of\r\nthe result, I will not lose myself.\r\nThank you for your story\r\nM. Wangari, Nairobi\r\nWorld of private eyes\r\nLast week\u2019s article on cheating\r\nspouses was very educative and\r\nincisive. Keep up with keeping\r\nus posted on what is happening\r\nin the \u201cprivate eye\u201d world!\r\nJeremy\r\nRaising baby girls\r\nJosaya, I hope you are well. I\r\njust want to let you know that\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed reading\r\nyour article titled \u201cRaising\r\na fabulous girl in the \u2018hood\r\n(Living October 8, 2008). You\r\narticulated my fears (I have a\r\nbaby girl aged three years) and\r\nhighlighted my resolve. It calls\r\nfor great discipline to balance\r\nbetween love and firmness\r\nwhen raising a baby girl. Keep\r\nup the good work.\r\nLeakey Kibaki\r\nLast week\u2019s cover story titled\r\n\u201cAre the days of cheating\r\nspouses numbered at last?\u201d\r\ngot our online readers blogging\r\nendlessly. One issue that\r\nelicited heated debate, with a\r\nnumber expressing shock and\r\ndisgust, was that the number\r\nof unfaithful women is rising.\r\nOthers were disappointed that\r\nmarried Kenyans are out on\r\nthe loose, in this age of HIV\r\nand Aids. Some questioned the\r\ncredibility of the statistics by\r\nprivate investigation company,\r\nSpylink International, which\r\nshowed that a whopping 99\r\nper cent of married couples are\r\ncheating on each other. Here\r\nare some of the responses:\r\n\u201cIt is common knowledge that\r\nmen and women cheat as much\r\nas each other.\u201d\r\nMukumu\r\n**********\r\n\u201cHii shida ya wanawake\r\nimesumbua wanaume (Women\r\nhave troubled men) from the\r\ndays of King Solomon up to\r\nthe days of King Mswati. God\r\nhelp all men. I dedicate to all\r\nof them the song, These are\r\ntemptations.\u201d\r\nJauka the Villager\r\n**********\r\nCheating on a spouse could be\r\nfuelled by the desire to sample\r\nmore than what you have at\r\nhome. \u201cIt\u2019s thought that when\r\nwe get married, after some time\r\nwe graduate to \u2018MBA\u2019 (married\r\nbut available) status.\u201d\r\nJsalmin\r\n**********\r\n\u201cOur society is biased and\r\nharsher on women. It happened\r\neven in the Bible. When a man\r\ncheats, it is African and normal;\r\nwhen the wife does it, she is a\r\nprostitute. Come on men, stop\r\ncheating on your wives and\r\nthey will not do it. Why lie? If I\r\nfound my man doing it, I would\r\nrevenge straight up!\u201d\r\nRita\r\n**********\r\n\u201cWomen are bad creatures, they\r\ncan cheat and deny\u2026 Enforce\r\nDNA tests on all children and\r\nlet men know who their real\r\nchildren are. Men are bringing\r\nup other people\u2019s children\u2026\u201d\r\nJnyamweya\r\n**********\r\n\u201cEven worse is the fact that 99\r\nper cent of married couples\r\nare cheating on each other.\r\nThese guys (referring to Spylink\r\nInternational) need to have a\r\nsecond look at their figures.\r\nThis just cannot be true of the\r\nsituation in Kenya, or perhaps\r\nanywhere on this planet.\u201d\r\nMumala\r\n**********\r\n\u201cWhile some of the statistics\r\ncould be true, I highly doubt the\r\n99 per cent part\u2026\u201d\r\nKariuki"}
