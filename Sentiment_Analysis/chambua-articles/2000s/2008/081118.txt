{"text": "\ufeffDAILY NATION Tuesday November 18, 2008 \r\n\r\nEU threatens to withhold aid\r\nBy DAVID MUGONYI\r\nand OLIVER MATHENGE\r\n\r\nThe European Union yesterday\r\nthreatened to withhold budgetary\r\nsupport if the Waki and Kriegler\r\nreports are not implemented.\r\nEuropean Commission head of delegation\r\nto Kenya Eric van der Linden said the\r\nGovernment should also review the Constitution\r\nand land policies as agreed during\r\nthe peace talks that culminated in the\r\nGrand Coalition Government.\r\nThe move to withhold budgetary support\r\nwould have an adverse effect on Government\r\nprogrammes.\r\nIt would affect funding in education,\r\nhealth, especially the fight against HIV\r\nand Aids, and infrastructure projects,\r\nmainly roads construction.\r\nIt will especially exert pressure on this\r\nyear\u2019s budget, which has a huge deficit.\r\nThe Government had planned to raise\r\n$500 million from the international market\r\nthrough a sovereign bond. But due to\r\nthe international financial meltdown, this\r\nis no longer possible.\r\nFurthermore, the Kenya Revenue Authority\r\nhas already sent notice that it is\r\nunlikely to meet revenue targets for this\r\nfinancial year. If the EU withholds the\r\nsupport, the Government will be forced\r\nto borrow heavily from the local market\r\nto plug the budget deficit, causing inflation\r\nand interest rates to rise.\r\nAlthough the constitutional review and\r\nland reforms were part of Agenda Four of\r\nthe coalition deal, the Government has\r\nbeen accused of dragging its feet in addressing\r\nthe two issues.\r\nAsked what the conditions for the release\r\nof the budgetary support were, Mr\r\nLinden said: \u201cWe are waiting for the Waki\r\nand Kriegler reports to be implemented.\r\nThe development group is also looking at\r\nAgenda Four. We are looking if all conditions\r\nare met.\u201d\r\nHe said the international community\r\nalso wanted to see issues related to corruption\r\naddressed, adding that impunity\r\nmust be a thing of the past.\r\nFrench ambassador Elisabeth Barbier\r\nsaid the international community was\r\nclosely \u201cwatching and listening\u201d to what\r\nthe Government would do with the Waki\r\nreport. She said they expected the Cabinet\r\nto discuss the implementation of the\r\nreport when it meets this week.\r\n\u201cWe are keen to see the implementation\r\nof the report \u2026 there has been difficult debate\r\nbut we consider there is time for political\r\nleadership of this country to take a\r\nposition,\u201d said Ms Barbier.\r\nEnd to impunity\r\nShe said the Waki team handled a complex\r\nmandate and was transparent and\r\nobjective in the manner it recommended\r\nan end to impunity in the country.\r\nMs Barbier said although there was\r\nneed for further investigations, it was\r\nalso necessary to reform the police force\r\nas proposed by the Waki Commission.\r\nThe two were speaking at a press conference\r\nat the French ambassador\u2019s residence\r\nwhen they briefed the media on\r\nEuropean Development Days.\r\nThe country\u2019s 2007/2008 budget has\r\na deficit of Sh5.3 billion, with this gap of\r\nabout five per cent expected to be largely\r\nfilled by donors. The EU is one of the top\r\ndonors. Since 2002 it has financed the\r\nGovernment budget to the tune of Sh28.4\r\nbillion."}
