{"text": "DAILY NATION 22ND NOVEMBER 2008\r\n\r\nThere's hardly any place to hide from HIV\r\n\r\nAbstinence and faithfulness to one uninfected\r\npartner remain the the centrepieces of\r\nmany campaigns HIV and Aids\r\naround the world. In Kenya, they are the\r\nreason religious movements like Christianity\r\nand Islam have joined the world as\r\nprogressive forces against HIV because of\r\nthe confluence between this message and\r\nthe theologies of these faiths.\r\nThe implied reward of abstinence is marriage\r\nand a long life. The same is the case\r\nfor having one uninfected partner. The\r\nlaunch ofthe documentary film, The Silent\r\npartner: HIV in Marriage in Nairobi\r\nthis week is likely to shake the foundations\r\nof this reward system in the future.\r\nWhile maniage continues to be an important\r\nsocial institution in Kenya with\r\ntwo out of every three people between\r\n15 and 64 years either married or-living\r\nwith a partner, it offers very little'protection against HIV. The testimonies on film\r\naside, at least one partner is living with\r\nHIV in 10 per-cent of married couples.\r\nonly two thirds of Kenyan adults infected with\r\nHIV say they are living in a union.\r\nOnly 3 per cent of Kenyans in a marriage\r\nor a cohabitating arrangement reported\r\nusing condoms the last time they had sex,\r\naccording to thejoumal, Population and\r\nDevelopment Review:\r\nMany ofthe issties around infection with\r\nHIV in marriage arise from the power relations\r\nbetween men and women. For as\r\nlong as women depend on men economically\r\nand have little power over howto\r\nrun their lives, marriage not such as safe\r\nplace to take refuge from HIV: As fonner\r\nnominated MP Njoki Ndung'u says in the\r\nfilm, it appears thatwomen are property\r\npassed on from ownership by the father\r\nto the husband.\r\n \t"}
