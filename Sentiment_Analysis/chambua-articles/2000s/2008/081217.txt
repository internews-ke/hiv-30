{"text": "\ufeffWednesday December 17, 2008\r\nThe writing is now on the wall: media\r\nreports that many marriages are\r\nunder threat from the scourge of HIV\r\nand Aids should be taken very seriously,\r\nespecially by married couples themselves.\r\nThis might well be the reality check we need.\r\nAs we commemorated World Aids Day at the\r\nbeginning of the month, the issue of HIV in\r\nmarriages explained the increasing number of\r\norphans in various parts of the country.\r\nThe reality in some households is a scenario\r\nof an insidious killer whose consequences\r\nare long-term in the form of socio-economic\r\nchallenges. We might be sitting on a viral\r\ntime bomb that many couples have taken\r\nfor granted even while their marriages have\r\nbecome characterised by infidelity.\r\nIt is sad that the rate of married people who\r\nare straying out of their bedrooms has been\r\non the increase, leading to the rise in couples\r\nsuccumbing to HIV and Aids.\r\nSome time ago, an eyebrow-raising study\r\nrevealed that many married women were\r\ncrossing marital borders for pleasure whose\r\nfruits were unwanted pregnancies. The result\r\nwas that their husbands were unknowingly\r\nraising children fathered outside the\r\nmarriage!\r\nThe study went on to say that 50 per cent\r\nof married women were likely to stray and\r\nconsequently end up with the so-called \u201coutgrower\u201d\r\nchildren. Maybe what we need to\r\nimagine is the number of married people that\r\nend up testing positive for HIV after such risky\r\nadventures.\r\nBut married women are not the only\r\nculprits. Married men are also fishing in\r\nforeign waters. As one advert puts it, men\r\nshould \u201cWachana na mpango ya kando (forget\r\nabout \u2018alternative arrangements\u2019) for a better\r\nfuture. Married men need to understand that\r\nthe grass will never be greener on the other\r\nside. Those who are in stable monogamous\r\nmarriages should not be deluded by the\r\ntrends of an increasingly permissive society\r\nand get stuck in immorality. This is because\r\nthe family, in spite of Western influence, or\r\nour modern hectic lifestyles, or whatever\r\nother challenges we face, will remain the\r\nbasic most vital unit of society.\r\nThe moment something bad happens to\r\nthe family, we can expect a long-term effect\r\nto be felt by the entire society. And so far, we\r\nare not doing too well leaving behind a trail\r\nof Aids orphans in our wake. Being faithful to\r\nour marriages is a virtue that will save society\r\nfrom future problems.\r\nThe A (Abstinence), B (Be faithful), C (Use\r\ncondoms) and D (Take antiretroviral drugs)\r\napproach that has been used to alleviate\r\nthe spread of HIV and Aids deserves some\r\nmention with regards to the family. The way I\r\nsee it is that we have paid more attention to C\r\nwhile the real issues lie in A, B and even D. We\r\nmight be chorusing the song of condom use\r\nand importing millions of condoms, while in\r\nfact the rescue vehicle lies in abstinence and\r\nbeing faithful in marriage.\r\nThe fact is that unlike C, A and B will never\r\nlet us down. That is why children should\r\nbe encouraged to practice abstinence as\r\nthey grow up, and then go for HIV testing\r\nbefore marriage. And once married, the vital\r\ncomponent of being faithful should become\r\npart and parcel of everyday marital life.\r\nIf the latest reports on the spread of HIV and Aids are not enough to make everyone sit up and take\r\nnotice, then it might already be too late for us as a society, writes ESMOND SHAHONYA\r\nHow many more reality checks do we need?\r\nHAVE YOUR SAY\r\nSend in your 700-word article on matters\r\naffecting the family to living@nation.co.ke\r\nwith \u201cHave Your Say\u201d as the subject.
