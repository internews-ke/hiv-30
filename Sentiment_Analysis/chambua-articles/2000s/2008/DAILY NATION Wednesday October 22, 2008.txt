Inspirational courage
I read your story titled “A
ruthless disease that changes
your whole life” last week.
Patrick Mageria and Elizabeth
Ragui, the two breast cancer
survivors, are such an
inspiration to me. How I wish
I had the courage to look at
life so positively, especially in
view of their conditions. I am
scheduled for an operation to
detect whether the lump in my
breast contains cancerous cells.
My prayer is that regardless of
the result, I will not lose myself.
Thank you for your story

World of private eyes
Last week’s article on cheating
spouses was very educative and
incisive. Keep up with keeping
us posted on what is happening
in the “private eye” world!

Raising baby girls
Josaya, I hope you are well. I
just want to let you know that
I thoroughly enjoyed reading
your article titled “Raising
a fabulous girl in the ‘hood
(Living October 8, 2008). You
articulated my fears (I have a
baby girl aged three years) and
highlighted my resolve. It calls
for great discipline to balance
between love and firmness
when raising a baby girl. Keep
up the good work.

Last week’s cover story titled
“Are the days of cheating
spouses numbered at last?”
got our online readers blogging
endlessly. One issue that
elicited heated debate, with a
number expressing shock and
disgust, was that the number
of unfaithful women is rising.
Others were disappointed that
married Kenyans are out on
the loose, in this age of HIV
and Aids. Some questioned the
credibility of the statistics by
private investigation company,
Spylink International, which
showed that a whopping 99
per cent of married couples are
cheating on each other. Here
are some of the responses:
“It is common knowledge that
men and women cheat as much
as each other.”

“Hii shida ya wanawake
imesumbua wanaume (Women
have troubled men) from the
days of King Solomon up to
the days of King Mswati. God
help all men. I dedicate to all
of them the song, These are
temptations.”
Jauka the Villager
**********
Cheating on a spouse could be
fuelled by the desire to sample
more than what you have at
home. “It’s thought that when
we get married, after some time
we graduate to ‘MBA’ (married
but available) status.”
Jsalmin
**********
“Our society is biased and
harsher on women. It happened
even in the Bible. When a man
cheats, it is African and normal;
when the wife does it, she is a
prostitute. Come on men, stop
cheating on your wives and
they will not do it. Why lie? If I
found my man doing it, I would
revenge straight up!”
Rita

“Women are bad creatures, they
can cheat and deny… Enforce
DNA tests on all children and
let men know who their real
children are. Men are bringing
up other people’s children…”
Jnyamweya

“Even worse is the fact that 99
per cent of married couples
are cheating on each other.
These guys (referring to Spylink
International) need to have a
second look at their figures.
This just cannot be true of the
situation in Kenya, or perhaps
anywhere on this planet.”
Mumala

“While some of the statistics
could be true, I highly doubt the
99 per cent part…”
