Leaders stay away
from World Aids Day
By AMINA KIBIRIGE
Despite persistent pleas to
leaders to be in the forefront
in the fight against HIV and
Aids, this year’s World Aids
Day was a low-key affair with
one nominated MP attending
the event at Mombasa Municipal
Stadium.
Sheikh Mohammed Dor
urged Kenyans to openly discuss
the disease.
Faith-based
Describing Kenyans as faithbased
individuals, Sheikh Dor,
who is also the secretary-general
of the Council of Imams
and Preachers of Kenya said
religious leaders should be
empowered to help fight the
infection at the grassroots.
“More than 85 percent of
Kenyans are associated with
their religions. It is, therefore,
important that the National
Aids Control Council empowers
religious leaders through
funding and association to enable
them champion the fight
against HIV and Aids infections,”
Sheikh Dor said.
Coast provincial commissioner
Earnest Munyi, whose
speech was read on his behalf
by an official from his
office, acknowledged the role
of leadership portrayed in this
year’s theme “Lead-Empower-
Deliver”.
“This theme is meant to
highlight the fact that many
individuals and organisations
have already offered their
leadership skills and now
policymakers need to find
resources to deliver on their
promises. The campaign is
calling on everyone, including
governments, to take the initiative
in helping to meet the
targets,” he said.
Coast provincial Aids and
STI control officer Waudo Siganga
said the rate of infection
at the Coast had increased by
1.5 per cent in one year.
Not know
“According to the Kenya Aids
Indication Survey, Coast Province
has an infection rate of 7.9
per cent, with women being
double infected mainly due
to their status as recipients,”
said Mr Siganga, adding that
the figures represented the age
bracket of 15 to 64 years old.
He said that 80 per cent of
those infected did not know
their status with half not having
gone for tests and the other
half being new infections.
He said that besides testing
facilities, ARV treatment was
now available at health facilities
in a region.
