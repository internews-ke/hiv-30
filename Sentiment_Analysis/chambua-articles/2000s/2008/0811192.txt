{"text": "\ufeffWednesday November 19, 2008\r\n\r\nBoys become increasingly vulnerable\r\nIn the last few months, children\u2019s rights organisations have cited an\r\nincrease in sexual abuse against boys, writes MILLICENT MWOLOLO.\r\n\r\nThirteen year-old Hassan is\r\na Standard Four pupil at\r\nShangilia Mtoto wa Afrika, a\r\nrescue centre for vulnerable\r\nand abused children. The tall,\r\nshy, light-skinned boy, who is an orphan,\r\noriginally comes from Marsabit. But\r\nhe left home about four years ago and\r\nhasn\u2019t been back. When schools close\r\nfor the holidays, he says, he goes to\r\nvisit his friends, David and BJ, who live\r\nin Langata, Nairobi. The couple have a\r\ndaughter who is a bit older than him. He\r\nsays they have all made him feel like part\r\nof their family.\r\nHassan has just sat for a written test\r\nand come fourth in a class of nine. But\r\nbehind his smiling demeanour is a bitter\r\npast that he cannot erase. When he was\r\nnine years old, Hassan was sexually\r\nassaulted by a schoolmate at a day school\r\nin Marsabit. David and BJ, missionariescum-\r\nveterinary doctors, came to his\r\nrescue and connected him to Shangilia\r\nMtoto wa Afrika.\r\nHis case is one among an alarmingly\r\nincreasing number. \u201cWe are now\r\nwitnessing an increase in the number\r\nof sexual abuse cases against boys in\r\nthe form of sodomy,\u201d says Irene Nyamu,\r\nthe director of Childline Kenya, an\r\norganization that runs a helpline for\r\nchildren in distress.\r\nOther ways in which boys are being\r\nabused, she adds, is through exposure\r\nto pornography. \u201cThis is happening in\r\nthe video dens that have mushroomed in\r\nmost of our informal settlements \u2013 Kibera\r\nand Kayole are the most affected by this\r\nform of abuse.\u201d\r\nIrene laments that young boys are\r\nbeing drugged and then abused by young\r\nand middle-aged men most of whom are\r\nidle and waylay the children as they walk\r\nto and from school.\r\nAt Shangilia Mtoto wa Afrika, Japheth\r\nNjenga the centre\u2019s director, says they\r\nhave rescued more boys from the streets\r\nin the past one year than ever before.\r\n\u201cThere are more boys than there are\r\ngirls on the streets,\u201d he says, adding that\r\nthis disparity means that boys are being\r\nabused more at home.\r\nSpeaking on sodomy, Brian Weke, a\r\nprogramme manager on child rights\r\nawareness at the Child Rights Advisory\r\nDocumentation and Legal Centre\r\n(Cradle) confirms that the incidents of\r\nsexual abuse on boys have increased in\r\nthe past few months. \u201cWe have received\r\na good number of sodomy cases from\r\nschools and other institutions, and even\r\nrehabilitation centres. In the past week,\r\nfor instance, we have handled two cases,\r\nsomething that was not happening\r\nbefore,\u201d says Brian.\r\nThe centre received the case of a 10-\r\nyear-old boy who had been sodomised\r\nby a fellow student. \u201cThere are especially\r\na lot of sodomy cases that we\u2019re getting\r\nfrom the Eastlands areas of Bahati,\r\nJericho, Pumwani and Shauri Moyo,\u201d\r\nhe says. \u201cAn on-going street children\r\nrehabilitation programme in the area has\r\na lot to do with this, as it has brought very\r\nmany of them together,\u201d Brian explains.\r\nA few weekends ago, both Cradle and\r\nChildline Kenya held a four-day football\r\ntournament that was dubbed \u201cKick Child\r\nAbuse out of Eastlands\u201d, which brought\r\ntogether up to 10,000 children in Bahati.\r\n\u201cThe children, together with the local\r\ncommunity, were sensitised on the ongoing\r\nsexual violence, how to protect\r\nthemselves from abuse and where to seek\r\nhelp when it happens,\u201d Brian explains.\r\nHe is of the opinion that civil society\r\norganisations have cracked the whip\r\non people who abuse girls so often and\r\nhard that the result has been that childabusers\r\nhave shifted their unwelcome\r\nattention to boys.\r\nJapheth cites the increase in poverty\r\nlevels among the urban and rural\r\npopulation as a key contributing factor\r\nto boys running to the streets from where\r\nthey are more open to sexual abuse. He\r\nsays that many children find themselves\r\non the streets in search of a better option.\r\n\u201cThis is due to the harshness of some\r\nparents towards their children,\u201d he says.\r\nTo some extent, boys tend to be more\r\nrebellious than girls and when this\r\nhappens, if they have no one else to run,\r\nboys opt for the streets. \u201cIn addition, the\r\nlack of adult household heads has given\r\nway to child-headed families, creating\r\ndifficult home situations\u201d he adds.\r\nWhile on the streets, boys and girls\r\nhave different methods of survival. \u201cGirls\r\nbeg and engage in child prostitution\r\nbefore they graduate into professional\r\nprostitutes. Boys beg and also snatch\r\nother people\u2019s property \u2013 wallets,\r\nhandbags and so on \u2013 before graduating\r\ninto hardcore criminals,\u201d says Njenga.\r\nIf there are no measures taken to rescue\r\nchildren from the streets, the crime and\r\nprostitution rate already being practiced\r\nin the society will soar. \u201cThe implications\r\nwould be premature deaths from drug\r\nabuse, police shootings and HIV and\r\nAids. Our future would be going to\r\nwaste as we stand to lose a generation\r\nthat would have given back to society,\u201d\r\nNjenga explains.\r\nHe feels that the military style of getting\r\nchildren off the streets is nothing short of\r\ninhuman. \u201cInstead, we should as a society\r\nbegin by finding out why the children,\r\nand more so an increasing number of\r\nboys, are running to the streets. This\r\nwould be a labour-intensive exercise as\r\nit would involve counselling and social\r\nwork, but at least, it is somewhere to\r\nbegin,\u201d he says.\r\nHe adds that the government should\r\nsend social workers to the streets to\r\ninteract with these children, understand\r\nwhere they are coming from and\r\nimplement individual solutions.\r\nAt Shangilia Mtoto wa Afrika, the\r\nnumber of girls now stands at 100,\r\nwhile the boys number 129. The Child\r\nHelpline director says over the last\r\nthree months, they, together with the\r\nChildren\u2019s Department, have handled\r\nover 300 child abuse cases; close to 10\r\nper cent of the children are boys. \u201cThis is\r\na rare occurrence compared to the past,\u201d\r\nexplains Irene.\r\nTo curb sexual criminal perpetration\r\non boys, Brian says the government, child\r\nrights organisations and the civil society\r\nshould raise awareness on what the law\r\nsays about sodomy in order to sensitise\r\nthe public. After all, the Sexual Offences\r\nAct addresses both genders.\r\n\u201cFor anyone to engage in sexual\r\nactivity \u2013 whether with consent or not\r\n\u2013 with anyone under 18 years of age is\r\nan offence,\u201d he says. The penalties differ\r\naccording to the age of the person under\r\nassault.\r\n\u201cIf the sexually abused person is below\r\n11 years, the culprit is to be given a life\r\nsentence. If the child is aged between 11\r\nand 15 years, the culprit is to be jailed for\r\nnot less than 20 years. If the child is aged\r\nbetween 15 and 18 years, the offender\r\nis subject to an 18-year imprisonment,\u201d\r\nBrian explains, adding that this applies to\r\nboth a male and a female child.\r\nmmwololo@nation.co.ke"}
