Bridge between patients and practice

As we celebrate the
20th World Aids Day
this month, we need
new and effective approaches
to the public health
challenges in the war against
HIV/Aids.
The world has 33 million
people living with the virus,
making it one of the most destructive
epidemics in recorded
history.
Over the past 10 years, the
reach of mobile telephones has
increased, making the mobile
phone the most common tool
in the hands of the common
man. It can therefore be used
to put brakes on the spread of
HIV/Aids.
Personal statements
Think about the ringtones in
our phones. They have become
such personal statements that
some countries such as India
have specially created them to
pass messages in a fun way.
The BBC World Service
Trust, the charitable arm of
the British Broadcasting Corporation,
has been running a
public health campaign and
has now launched a condom
ringtone to make clear the
message that “smart men use
condoms.”
The condom ringtone was
launched in August and in
only four months 660,000
people had downloaded it to
their phones.
Here is one scene, played
out at a wedding in India: a
mobile buzzes with a loud
refrain, “condom! condom!”
The BBC Trust writes: “Embarrassing
for the person
holding the mobile phone?
Not a bit of it – the reaction
of those around the red-faced
man is to see him as smart and
responsible.” If you also want
to be like him, here is the link:

Call-back messages
In South Africa, a project
dubbed “Project M” seeks
to address HIV/Aids with
a number of different approaches
using the mobile
phone. The project is built
around the use of call-back
messages, delivering about 1
million HIV/Aids and TB messages
each day, for one year,
to the public, piggybacking
on the free, widely used form
of SMS called Please Call Me
(PCM).
Each sent PCM message has
the words “Please Call Me,”
the phone number of the caller,
and space for an additional
120 characters. The extra space
is normally filled with advertising,
which helps offset the
cost of running the service.
Trained operators provide
callers with accurate health
care information, counselling
and referrals to local testing
clinics. The project also seeks
to implement “virtual call centres,”
where existing help lines
will be staffed by teams of
trained HIV-positive patients
to field questions, remotely
via their mobile phones, from
the public. These lay counsellors
are knowledgeable about
the illness, diligent about
their treatment regimens, and
familiar with the stigma and
despair that a positive diagnosis
can cause.
Here in Kenya, a project
known as Phones-for-Health
featuring a mobile phonebased
information system,
is in the pilot-testing stage.
The software is loaded onto
a standard handset, which
will allow health care workers
in the field to enter critical
health information into a central
database in real time. The
data will be transmitted either
using a standard GPRS mobile
connection or an SMS channel.
The development of 3G wireless
technology holds further
promise in the fight against
HIV.
To fast-track health care
delivery in Kenya, a wireless
health care programme has
been launched to improve efficiency
in anti-retroviral drugs
distribution, which has been a
serious challenge.
The project, known as the
Wireless Reach Kenya Partnership,
was developed by Research
Triangle International.
It will enable doctors to collect
vital information on patients,
including their viral loads,
and identify the patients lost
to follow-up for better management.
Although being implemented
on a small scale, this initiative
holds hope for both patients
and health managers.
Ignorant of disease
Uganda has an innovative
programme that uses text
messages as an interactive
tool in improving HIV/Aids
awareness and education. The
project, Text to Change, uses
cell phones to promote HIV/
Aids knowledge, especially
among the youth who are ignorant
of the disease, by creating
dialogue that will increase
awareness of HIV and reduce
stigma and discrimination.
But some countries are
using technology to undo
some of the gains made in
fighting HIV-related stigma.
In Indonesia, for example,
politicians are planning to
tag all HIV/Aids patients with
radio frequency identification
chips. They want to monitor
and identify people who had
shown “active sexual behaviour”.
Amid protests, a bylaw on
HIV/Aids is about to be passed
that includes a controversial
article requiring certain
people living with HIV to be
implanted with a microchip.
Once a patient is found to have
infected a healthy person, they
will be punished. Critics have
termed it a narrow-minded
approach.
