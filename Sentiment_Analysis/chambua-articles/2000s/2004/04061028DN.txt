In the early 1960s, a campaign for\r\n- paranteral treatment of schistosomiasis in Egypt resulted in the\r\n   first documented large-scale outbreak of Hepatitis C.\r\n       In 1976, an outbreak of Ebola (haemorrhagic fever virus) was\r\n   linked to unsafe injections given at a hospital where the first\r\n   patient had been treated with injections.\r\n       Unsafe injections thus constitute a public health concern\r\n   requiring urgent and appropriate preventive measures.\r\n       The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a safe injection\r\n   as one that does no harm to the recipient, does not expose the\r\n   health workers to any risk, and does not result in waste that is\r\n   dangerous for the community.\r\n       To achieve this, the injection needs to be prepared in a clean\r\n   area, using medication drawn from a sterile vial.\r\n       The injection musfbe administered using a sterile syringe and\r\n   needle. After administration, sharp equipment needs to be dis-\r\n  carded in a puncture proof container for appropriate disposal.\r\n   Any break or department for this procedure represents a risk ren-\r\n   dering the injection unsafe.\r\n   WHO estimates that un~afe injections maybe responsible for:           .\r\n   \u2022 8 to 16 million cases: of Hepatitis B (33 per cent of new Hepati- .\r\n   tis Binfections annually)\r\n  \u2022 2 to 5 million cases of Hepatitis C\r\n   \u2022 80,000 to 160,000 cases of HIV/Aids\r\n       Unsafe injections are a powerful engine to transmit blood\r\n   borne pathogens (disease-causing micro-organisms).
