{"text": "\ufeffNation /February 22, 2004\r\n\r\nHEALTH THREATS AMID ACUTE DRUG SHORTAGE\r\n\r\nBY VICTOR BWIRE\r\nKenya faces one of the worst health cri\u2022\r\nscs in recent years following a major\r\nshortage of essential drugs.\r\nThe situation has been made worse\r\nby the failure by the Ministry of Flealth\r\nto buy tendered drugs meant to treat\r\nkiller diseases like malaria, tuberculosis\r\nand HlVIAids.\r\nDisease outbreak\r\nShould any disease outbreak occur\r\nnow, the country would be in a critical\r\nstate as government stores have virtu\r\nally depleted their stocks of essential\r\ndrUgs.\r\nThe Ministry of Health has not\r\nordered new medical supplies for pub\r\nlic hospitals since the 2002t2003 finan\r\ncial year. More than Sh2 billion meant\r\nfor purchasing medical items is lying\r\nidle on orders of Health Permanent\r\nSecretary Wellington Godo.\r\nMr Godo confirmed issuing (he\r\norders, but blamed the delay on the\r\nnew government\u2019s regulations that\r\nrequire the ministry to slop buying\r\nitems through agents. He has, however.\r\ndirected the letters of offer for the\r\nitems to be sent out to the winning bid\r\nders. Should this be done, the earliest\r\nthe items can be received is July.\r\n\u201cPreviously, the ministry bough t\r\nmedical stores through agents which\r\ncost the government a lot of money in\r\ncommissions. We were instructed to\r\nestablish our own purchasing system,\u201d\r\nMr Godo said.\r\nA recent dispatch from the Kenya\r\nMedical Supplies Agency (Kemsa)\r\nlogistics unit indicates that stocks of the\r\nmost essential items such as surgical\r\ngloves, family planning pills and con\r\ndoms are vwtually depleted.\r\nLt is feared that with the onset of the\r\nlong rains any time from now, malaria-\r\nprone areas could be hit badly.\r\nHI V-positiv e\r\nSimilarly. the more than 200,000 HIV\r\npositive people in urgent need of life\r\nprolonging anti-retroviral treatment in\r\nthe country may be forced to wait for\r\nanother four months to access the\r\ndrugs.\r\nHopes of TB patients getting free\r\ntreatment are just a dream as most pub-\r\nlic hospitals do not have the basic anti\r\nbiotics. The situation is the same for all\r\nthe other diseases.\r\nWhile senior government officials\r\nhave been talking about plans for free\r\nmedical care for Kenyans, information\r\nis emerging that the Country is sitting on\r\na time-bomb.\r\nTenders for the purchase of essential\r\ndrugs lo treat killer diseases were\r\nadvertised last year but stakeholders\r\nhave been claiming that there were\r\nflaws.\r\nThe Kenya Coalition of Essential\r\nMedicines said some of the advertised\r\ndrugs were non-existent, while drugs\r\nfor HLV-positive children and those\r\nwith TB had not been catered for.\r\nSome of the losing bidders have\r\nappealed to the ProcuremeRt and Ten\r\nder Appeals Board. .\r\nMr Godo said the process of strength\r\nening the ministry\u2019s internal procure\r\nment mechanism has just been finalised\r\nand the orders will be issued any\r\ntime. The PS confirmed that the minis\r\ntry is yet to make any purchases this\r\nfinancial year because of \u201cechnical\u201d\r\nreasons.\r\n\u201cThe delay has been caused by the\r\nrestructuring of the Kenya Medical Sup\r\nplies Agency to make it the sole pur\r\nchasing parastatal for all medical sup\r\nplies to the government.\u201d he said.\r\nThe continued delay in signing the\r\norders may also see the ministry lose its\r\nvote to the Treasury in three months\r\ntime on expiry of the current financial\r\nyear."}
