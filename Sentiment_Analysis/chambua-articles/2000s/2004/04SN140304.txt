MAENDELEO'S PLEA OVER AIDS MEETING

Controversy over the women’s
conference on Aids continued
yesterday with an organisation
claiming that Cabinet Minister
Charity Ngi)u blocked it from
organising the symposium.
Maendeleo ya Wanawake
claimed it had been approached
by scnior Ministry of Health offi
cials who wanted the NGO to
organise the conference only for
Health Minister Charity Ngilu to
go round them.
Mrs Zipporah Kittony, the
chairlady of Maendeleo, said
they had even gone as far as
making the budget for the con
ference, and were just preparing
lo invite the women when Mrs
Ngilu used her influence io block
them.
Mrs Ngilu is caught in a con
troversy that could affect Aids
funding for Kenya. At the centre
of the row is the role of her
daughter and close political allies
in a Sh30 million conference in
Nairobi last month.
The Ministry of Health
contracted the non-governmental
organisation. Women Advocacy
for Rural Development to mobi- 
lise women to attend the Aids
conference on February 21.
Yesterday, Mrs Kittony said
Mrs Ngilu intimidated officials at
Maendeleo to abandon the
project.
Mrs Kittony asked the govern-
ment to invesligatc the scandal,
saying public money was
misused,
Meanwhile, the first constitu
ency HlVIAids control commit
tee was yesterday launched in
Nairobi with demands that
Health Minister Ngilu clears her
name over the controversial Sh30
million national conference.
Kasarani MP William Omondi
expressed fear that unless the
minister exonerates herself the
public and forcign donors would
lose confidence in the govern
ment’s anti HIV/Aids pro
grammes championed by Presi
dent Kibaki and First Lady Lucy
Kibaki.
The MP said most Kenyans
were supporting the govern
ment’s anti-Aids campaigns.
