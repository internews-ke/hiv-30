    ARVs for the Ministry of Health (MoH) tender cannot do so
    because it has no approval from the Ministry of Trade and Industry.

        The companies, however, complain that it has been difficult to get
     called compulsory licensing from the government. Compulsory
     licensing is required to enable local companies manufacture generics
     of branded drugs that are covered by patents.
        It is a World Trade Organisation (WTO) instrument that grants
     concessions to Third World countries to manufacture patented drugs
     without prohibition by the patent holder. The licensing is, however,
     not required on ARVs whose patents have expired.
        Using this instrument, a country can bypass patent rules and grant
     any company a compulsory licence to manufacture ARVs or other
