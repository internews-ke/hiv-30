                     tion by an insect that invaded the country from Ugan-
  T                  da. Scientists estimate that about 40 per cent of Ken-
                     ya's forests could be destroyed. Eucalyptus trees form
                     the single biggest family of plantation species in Ken-
                     ya's forestry.
       Scientists liken the threat to the 1990 massive destruction of
   cypress trees by an alien pest in Kenya. The blue gum chalcid is an
   insect in the bee-wasp family and like the eucalyptus, it is a native of
   Australia.
       It has extensively damaged the Eucalyptus in Iran, Israel, Moroc-
   co, Italy and Uganda. In Kenya, it entered from the western direction
   where it is doing great damage.
       According to Eston Mutitu, a·senior researcher at the Kenya For-
                                         estry Research Institute (KEFRI),
                                         the country is yet to come up with a
                                         solution to counter the destructive
                                         insect. However trials are underway
                                         to introduce a biological control.
                                          . Addressing a scientific conference
                                         at Kefri earlier this month, Mutitu
                                         said the most affected are the now
                                         popular tissue culture species com-

                                         been in the country since the early
                                         colonial days.
                                            The chalcid kills the tree by feed-

       There are over 800 species of Eucalyptus worldwide, with Kenya
   hosting some 600 of these. Enumerating the virtues of the tree, Paul
   Barasa, the information officer at KEFRI, says that Eucalyptus is
   even referred to as the woman's tree because of its popularity among
    women in rural Kenya. Barasa adds that although the species is
    allegedly said to be water wasting, it ~ill ~nd up consul!ling less wat~r

    farmer to drain off unwanted water logged patches of the farm.
