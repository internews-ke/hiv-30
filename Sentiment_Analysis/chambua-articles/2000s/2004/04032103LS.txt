{"text": "\ufeffSunday Nation! March 21, 2004\r\n\r\nCONTINUED FROM PAGE 2\r\nMINUTES OF LATENESS BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH\r\n\r\norphans live with custodians - mostly their\r\ngrandparents or aunties and uncles.\r\n\"I thought the extended family unit was the\r\nbest suited to take care of the orphans, obviously\r\nbetter than an orphanage. The children come\r\ntogether often to play and share ideas,\" says\r\nMwende.\r\nOn a voluntary basis, Dr Sarah Onyango,\r\nTwana Twitu's deputy director, Dr Sarah\r\nOnyango and Mwende's father, Mr Maluki Mwinzi,\r\nco-ordinate the organisation's events in Kenya.\r\nEvery month they deliver maize flour, cooking\r\nfat, sugar, and soap to the children. Mwende then\r\nsends money to settle the bill and school fees. The\r\nguardians are fed too and clothed.\r\nSocial worker Mrs Mutune Nzinzi goes round\r\nthe various homes to make sure the children are\r\nfed and go to school.\r\nTwana Twitu has arranged with Muthale Mission\r\nHospital, Mwingi, for medical care of the\r\norphans. Plans are under way to provide the HIVpositive\r\nones with free anti-retroviral drugs. Here\r\n, there is a problem though. Most of the guardians\r\nwon't allow their children to undergo the HIV\r\ntest, maybe due to .the stigma associated with the\r\naffliction.\r\nAs she recounts her experience of that dark\r\nSeptember 11, Mwende can't help thinking how\r\nshe missed death by a whisker. \"Everything just\r\nwent wrong. First I woke up feeling unwell. I contemplated\r\ncalling my office to say I was unwell but\r\nabandoned the idea. I wasn't that sick after all; I\r\nwas pregnant with my second son and such cases\r\nof discomfort were not unexpected.\"\r\nLate to work\r\nMwende was destined to be late to work on that\r\nfateful September 11. Probably her lateness that\r\nday saved her life. When she got a few metres\r\nfrom her office, the first plane hit the Twin Towers.\r\nMwende's \"mission\" to help the poor started\r\nrather by fluke. She was on vacation in Kenya\r\nand, as she went through the obituary pages, she\r\nnoticed that many of the dead people were aged\r\nbetween 26 and 45. A good number of them succumbed\r\nto HIV/Aids. Her village Migwani was\r\nnot spared as several couples had died of the disease,\r\nleaving their children helpless. Mwende's\r\nfather told her of a couple in the neighbourhood\r\nwho had died. She visited the home and decided\r\nto start assisting the four orphans and their grandmother\r\nin a small way.\r\nBorn 32 years ago to Maluki and Mary\r\nMwinzi, Mwende and her sister Kavathe\r\nand brother Muthinzi grew up in Kitui\r\ntown. \"We speak fluent Kikamba and\r\nare very proud of it.\"\r\nHer parents met in America where her father\r\nhad gone for studies. She was born there, and the\r\nfamily came to Kenya when she was 18 months\r\nold. Her father taught at Kitui High School for\r\nmany years while her mother was the headmistress\r\nat Mulango Girls. They have since retired.\r\nMwende attended Kitui Central Primary School\r\nfrom 1977 - 1983, Kenya High School, Nairobi,\r\n1984-85, and Kyeni Girls in Embu for her Alevels,\r\n1986-87. The following year she left for the\r\nUS where she joined the Grand Canyon University\r\nin Arizona and later Phoenix University to\r\nstudy marketing.\r\nHer first job\r\nMwende worked with Rubin Postaer, a media\r\nagency in Los Angeles from 1992-94. Then she\r\nmoved to KCOP-Channel13 in Los Angeles as a\r\nsales assistant, Interpost Systems as a pricing analyst\r\nbefore leaving in 1997. She joined Nomura\r\nCorporate Research and Asset Management as a\r\nmarketing associate and rose through the ranks to\r\nbecome the Deputy Vice-President. Here she is\r\nresponsible for investment proposals and marketing\r\nstrategies.\r\nShe is married to Nigerian lawyer Emeka Edozie,\r\nwho practises in New York. \"I met him in New\r\nJersey in 1995 but we started dating in 1997. We\r\nwere wedded in Mwingi in 1999,\" says a beaming\r\nMwende. Their first son, Mezz, was born in June\r\n2000 and the second son, Jaden, in March 2002.\r\nSays the young woman from Migwani: \"I adore\r\nmy community which has supported me all\r\nthrough. I love Kenya, it's my home. I'm very\r\nclose to my community. There are people 1\r\nadmire who are not necessarily involved in my\r\nkind of service. People like Nelson Mandela\r\nand Mother Teresa who did a lot for their\r\ncommunities.\"\r\nDuring a visit to Kenya a couple of weeks\r\nago, she was distributing condoms and pamplets\r\nto young people milling around her at\r\nTwana Twitu centre in Migwani. Her reason\r\nfor that: \"Prevention is the best cure. I don't\r\nwant to God by telling people what\r\nto do and what not to do. I agree abstinence is\r\nthe best method to prevent HlY/Aids but the\r\nfact is that people are having sex.\"\r\nMwende has big plans for the future. She\r\nwants to expand Twana Twitu to all parts of\r\nKenya. However, this means she has to raise\r\nlots of money for that. She is liaising with\r\nother organisations in Kenya and America.\r\nOne of them is the African Regional Youth\r\nInitiative, which has programmes for\r\norphans. They hold community bazaars to\r\neducate the youth about HIV/Aids.\r\nShe has approached Touch Africa and\r\nthe Michael' Wamalwa Foundation and\r\nthey are working together on some\r\nprogrammes.\r\nIn the US, Mwende has approached big\r\norganisations like Fubu and Payless -\r\nclothing and shoe\r\ndesigners - as well\r\nas Children's Place.\r\nAnother organisation,\r\nBooks for\r\nAfrica, has offered\r\nto donate books,\r\ncomputers and\r\nInternet facilities to\r\nthe Twana Twitu Centre in Migwani.\r\nMwende is organising a big fundraising\r\nrally in New York on June 5. She is appealing\r\nto all Kenyans in America and other\r\norganisations for support. Details can be\r\nobtained from their website.\r\n\r\nI was pulled out of Twin Towers debris, my baby survived\r\nBY MWENDE MWINZI\r\n\r\nLikemany other days in my sleep-deprived life, Tues -\r\nday, September 11,2001, started off with an alarm\r\nclock negotiation ... five minutes - let's make it 10\r\n- okay, just two more minutes pleeease! My bed was\r\njust as I liked it; nice, toasty, and luring, begging me to stay on.\r\n\"Perhaps I should call in sick?\" I thought sneakily.\r\n\"Time to get up!\" my husband Emeka said as he left for\r\nwork. Urgh! I gave up on the idea of more sleep and crawled\r\nout reminding myself that much work awaited me and further,\r\nthat I best not take my good health for granted. I had much to\r\nbe grateful for, after alii had a job I liked, a dynamic family and\r\nthe great news of expectancy. In six more months, Emekaand I\r\nwould welcome our second child into the familY:That atone was\r\n, reason to face the day!\r\nA quick look at the clock prompted me to scurry. It was\r\nalready 7.35 am and I had an 8.02 am train to catch from the\r\nScarsdale Station, which was 10 minutes away. I allowed the\r\n~how~r t? drizzle on me briefly before quickly dressing and\r\nJumping Into my car.\r\nThe fear of tardiness had sobered me. At work, I was always\r\nthe late culprit; what excuse would I give this time? I slammed\r\non the accelerator and charged down the street. \"Move it!\" I\r\nscreamed at the truck driver ahead of me. Where was he going,\r\nanyway, at this hour of the day? And in no hurry lit that ...\r\nHonk! \"Let me pass!\" .\r\nI arrived at the train station just in time to see my train pull\r\nout. This was not good but I had to tough it out.\r\nWaiting for next train\r\nAt 9.10 am mytrain pulled into New York's Grand Central Station.\r\nMy goal was simple; make it to work by 9.30 am. Anything\r\nlater would have been obnoxious. I hopped onto the New York\r\nCity Subway's train number five and headed downtown counting\r\neveryone of the 20 minutes the commuter took. So focused\r\nwas I on the time that I almost missed the conductor's\r\nannouncement that the train would not stop at my normal stop,\r\nFulton Street. Seeing as this was the exit to the World Trade\r\nCentre, whioh was adjoined to the building in which my office\r\nwas, the World Financial Centre, I should have worried that\r\nsomething was wrong. Instead, I celebrated. \"Yippee!\" I\r\nthought; that was my excuse - train problems!\r\nArmed with that, I leapt off the train at the next station,\r\nBrooklyn Bridge, to call work and explain my tardiness. Ring!\r\nRing! Finally, \"Hello Security!\" Huh? Why security? The\r\nbuilding had been evacuated, he said. No reason given.\r\nThe train passed the Fulton Street exit and pulled into the\r\nWall Street station to the smell of fire. \"Oh yeah! Sumtin' about\r\na plane!\" a lady said. I would get the horrific details minutes later.\r\nThe street~ were chaotic. Between the wild crowds, smoke\r\nand paper, this was not the place to be. \"Keep on moving!\r\nC'mon, let's go!\" pushed the police. We complied - keeping on\r\nmoving upward north, and closer it ... closer to the Trade Centre.\r\nI was unprepared for what I saw. Hanging out of the ever so\r\ntall skyscrapers were people frantically waving pieces of paper\r\nand pleading for rescue. People I had probably passed in the\r\nc~rri~ors at some point or other. Yet here they were, burning\r\nalive In front of all of us. \"Oh my God ... this is so evil!\" I kept\r\non repeating. Why would anyone be so cruel?\r\nSuddenly, as I was looking up, a lady, at least 50 flights up,\r\njumped out of the window. \"Oh no!\" the crowd collectively\r\nscreamed. And then another. It was too much to bear. My heart\r\nwas pounding, my head getting dizzy, I had tears streaming\r\ndown my face and my stomach feeling ill ... no, I couldn't pass\r\nout here. I had to leave. And so I turned.\r\nAnd I heard it - the crackle! The crackle that I thought was\r\n~ ch.ipfalling off the building; the crackle that triggered my\r\ninstincts to run; the crackle that would redefine my life.\r\n\"Damn!\"\r\nThe crowd began to scatter, running and screaming frantically,\r\ncarrying me with the motions - praying, crying, begging ...\r\n\"God please don't let me fall, please don't let me fall, God\r\nplease!\"\r\nAnd then it went dark ... pitch dark. Minutes later, still in the\r\ndark, I began to have eerie thoughts. Was I alive or did I just\r\nthink I was alive! My body, though pressed down by weight, felt\r\nmiraculously light. Was I a ghost? And then I heard them ...\r\nthe jet fighters. They were coming back for us - to bomb us - to\r\nfinish us off; this was it! I had survived the blast and now I was\r\ngoing to die - alone, far from my husband, without my children\r\nand a long way from home. I was going to die alone, like an animal\r\non the dirty streets of New York.\r\nAnd then a voice out of nowhere said: \"If you are alive anti\r\ncan hear me, get up and move!\" I had heard him. I was alive!\r\nBut I couldn't move. Smoke, dust, debris anel dread were weighing\r\nme down. \"Oh God!\" I thought, I was either going to suffocate\r\nor starve to death.\r\nI recall the calm with which I had made that realisation.\r\nAmazingly, I had little fear; rather, a sense of dread - a sense\r\nof despair. I remember lying there wondering how long it would."}
