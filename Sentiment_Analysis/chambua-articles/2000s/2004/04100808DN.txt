But our courts\r\nI   and scoundrels have gone scot free. Hanky panky on the\r\nand judicial commissions depend for their rulings almost\r\nentirely on evidence.\r\n    Granted, evidence itself may be lent dazzling colour by the\r\nlawyer's investigative skill and courtroom delivery. Criminal\r\nlawyer Byron Georgiadis's.spate of courtroom victories were\r\nenhanced by his ability to package his cases and his gift of\r\nthe gab.\r\n   But no matter. That is the nature of our judicial system. It\r\nis the reason we must celebrate the fact that - in keeping\r\nwith that postulate of justice we call the rule of law - a\r\njudicial commission has found Mr Justice Philip Waki\r\ninnocent of all charges of judicial corruption. It is a victory\r\nfor the system.\r\n   But it is also a victory for the man, who was so ruthlessly\r\nhounded out of office on charges of corruption. Sadly,\r\nthough, his victory is likely to be marred by the cynicism with\r\nwhich we judge our justice procedures.\r\n   What this simply means is that Mr Justice Waki - or any\r\nother \"big man\" - still has another battle to fight, this time\r\nin the court of public opinion which, frighteningly, is shaped\r\nby perceptions.
