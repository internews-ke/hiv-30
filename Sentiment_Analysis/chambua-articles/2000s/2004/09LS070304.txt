I    Troubled accountant 'hits bull's eye'
         first met Sonya when she was doing her A-
         levels at a private school in Nairobi. It was
         Sheila, the head teacher, who had rung me to
~        say the school doctor had diagnosed Sonya as a
    c~acute          appendicitis. "I have rung Sonya's
    parents who live in Kitale and they have asked me
    to refer her to my favourite surgeon," she had
    added.
       I ranked as her favourite surgeon because she
    herself had developed appendicitis a few years ear-
    lier and I had been called in to treat her. But that
    was not the only reason. Recently she had cele-
    brated her 50th birthday and to mark her half a
    century, she had thrown a big lavish party. Having
    heard me as an after-dinner speaker somewhere,
    she had asked me to be the guest speaker at her
    party and propose a toast.
       "Without the successful operation you performed
    on me, I might not have been here to celebrate this
    important milestone!" she had said in a flattering
    manner.
       That remark had given me a cue for opening my
    speech. "Ladies and gentlemen!" I said at the glit-
    tering occasion. "I feel very privileged that I have
    been asked to speak at this very happy and impor-
    tant event. I must, however, tell you why I have
    been given this honour. It is simply because I know
    Sheila inside out." As the guests craned their necks
    at this daring remark, I continued: "In case you
    misunderstood me, let me quickly explain. I oper-
    ated upon Sheila's abdomen a few months ago."
       I was now facing a sea of curiosity. "My Hippoc-
    rates oath does not allow me to disclose the nature
    of the disease or the operation but I can tell you
    one thing. The woman has got guts!" Well, that
 '" brought the house down and subsequently brought
     many patients to me from Sheila's school as well!
        Unfortunately, Sonya was not as lucky as her                It was Hugh on the line. "Doc, I told you that one day I would give you 'a surprise. You will be glad to know that I have hit the bull's eye

    stormy. This prolonged her stay in the hospital and
    gave me an opportunity to know her better. After a                                                                   dressing. "Perhaps a few pep-up pills is all I need to      I sat back for a while pondering and then picked
