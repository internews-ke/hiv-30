Film maker sticks to the tested path

           gerous Affair, is at it again. This time the

   Sticking to the formula that worked so well with
Dangerous Affair, collaborators Njeri Karago and
Judy Kibinge are making a film about modern,
urban Kenyans, dealing with their concerns and the
issues that affect their everyd'ay life.
    The twin issues of ethnicity and class dominate
this movie and although Karago describes the film
 as a romantic comedy, the very real spectre of the
 HIV Aids epidemic casts its long, dark shadow
 across the film, as does the issue of domestic vio-
 lence.
     Project Daddy is the story about Mumbi, a well-
 educated, modern Kikuyu woman, who works as a
 forensic detective for a leading commercial bank.
 -She is from a well-to-do background but is involved
  in a controversial relationship with Fred, a mechan-
  ic, and a Luo to boot!
     Everybody thinks Fred is a good-for-nothing lay-
  about, and clearly, totally undeserving of Mumbi.
 Cross cultural
 Mumbi is, however, deter-
 mined to make the relation-
 ship work, and insists that
 Fred take an HIV test
 before they make a commit-
 ment to each other.
     She does not want to risk
 either of them going the way
 of Kwach; a dear friend
 admitted in a local hospital                                                                                                                                                                                                 Photos/Stephen
