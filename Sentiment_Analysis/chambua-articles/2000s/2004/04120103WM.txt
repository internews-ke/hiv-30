She, like\r\nmany other Kenyans,\r\ndispute\r\nwhether Kenya's\r\nHIV prevalence\r\nrate has actually\r\ndeclined from 13.6\r\nper cent in 1997\r\nand 1998, to 9.4\r\nper cent in 2002,\r\nas claimed by UNAIDS in its\r\nannual AIDS Epidemic\r\nUpdate.\r\nAccording to her, the number of\r\nKenyans turning to KENWA for\r\nhelp is not declining but actually\r\nincreasing. A reason why\r\nUNAIDS cautions that the\r\nrecent declines in East Africa's\r\nepidemic may not herald a definitive\r\nreversal in these countries\r\nepidemics, and evidence of what\r\nthe agency warns will be increasing\r\nnumbers of people needing\r\ntreatment, care and support.\r\nLucas Gichamba is a 25-year-old\r\nvolunteer care-giver in Kiandutu,\r\nn informal settlement about 45\r\ns from Nairobi. In Janue\r\nwas bedridden with TB,\r\nst his job in a local illegal brewry\r\nand kicked out of the homes\r\nin which he sought refuge. He\r\neventually found shelter within\r\nthe walls of KENWA's Kiandutu\r\nHome-based Care Centre.\r\nMakeshift ambulance\r\nNursed back to good health by\r\nJosephine Wanjini, the project\r\nmanager in Kiandutu, Gichamba\r\nnow works at the centre caring\r\nfor both men and women. He\r\npulls a makeshift ambulance\r\nthrough the makeshift roads that\r\nweave themselves like a maze\r\nthrough the wooden and tin\r\nshacks of Kiandutu, to bring critically\r\nill patients requiring care\r\nto the centre.\r\nDespite being a volunteer,\r\nGichamba does not know\r\nwhether he needs anti-retroviral\r\ndrugs. In Kenya a person can\r\nonly access the life-prolongihg\r\ndrugs once you have paid for a\r\nseries of tests, including a CD4\r\ncell count test. This test measures\r\nhow well the immune system is\r\nfunctioning - once the CD4 cell\r\ncount falls to below 20ll, it is recommended\r\nthat the person, commences\r\nanti-retroviral treatment.\r\nLost their savings\r\nThe combined tests cost Shl,200.\r\nIf Gichamba needed ARVs, the\r\ndrugs alone would cost him\r\nSh500 a month, and he would\r\nneed to pay for the tests at least\r\nonce every six months.\r\nMany people living with HIV/\r\nAids that require treatment have\r\nalready lost their savings, their\r\njobs and, for subsistence farmers,\r\nthe ability to work the land.\r\nAccording to one journalist,\r\nmany people living with HIV/\r\nAids, particularly in the rural\r\nareas, die of starvation as they\r\nare unable to work the land and\r\nearn an income.\r\nThe Sh2,400 it would require for\r\na person to start treatment could\r\nbuy three bags of maize meal,\r\nvegetables for a month, cooking\r\noil and soap.\r\nIndeed, if the UNAIDS warning\r\nthat more people\r\nwill in the immediate\r\nfuture\r\nrequire greater\r\ncare and treatment\r\nis ignored,\r\nthen many people\r\nmay have to\r\nmake the decision\r\nbetween\r\nhaving food or\r\nbuying the lifeprolonging\r\ndrugs.\r\nAs an unemployed\r\nvolunteer\r\nwho earns no\r\nincome, life may\r\nsoon be beyond\r\nthe reach of\r\nLucas, unless a\r\ndonor comes forward or the government\r\nrevisits its pricing policies\r\non ARVs.\r\nCost of treatment\r\nPatrick Orege of the National\r\nAids Control Council of Kenya\r\nsays that the government is\r\ninvestigating ways of reducing\r\nthe costs of treatment, with the\r\npossibility of treatment being\r\nmade available to all those who\r\nneed it.\r\nBut it's not only the families and\r\nindividuals that have to make\r\nhard decisions. Even organisations\r\nsuch as KENWA are faced\r\ndaily with many difficult decisions.\r\nThe project in Kiandutu is currently\r\nfeeding 120 orphans and\r\ncaring for some 40 bed-ridden\r\nclients. Asked whether the\r\nproject provides support to children\r\nnot orphaned by Aids,\r\nWanjini, herself HIV-positive,\r\nlooks away and says that they\r\ncannot afford to provide such a\r\nservice and have had to turn children\r\naway.\r\nEven more worrying for Wanjini\r\nand the people receiving care\r\nthrough the Kiandutu project is\r\nthe fact that it only has funding\r\nuntil next February. It is currently\r\nfunded by the Global\r\nFund for Aids, TB and Malaria.\r\nAsked what will happen after\r\nthis date, Wanjini shakes her\r\nhead, looks up to the sky and\r\nsays simply, \"In God we trust.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCARING MAN AMONGST WOMEN\r\n\"Men just can't deal with the sight of a sick\r\nwoman, they do not want to touch her or\r\nclean her,\" says Lucas Gichamba, a 25-\r\nyear-old volunteer who is himself living\r\nwithHIV.\r\nFinding a man who is a care-giver is rare,\r\nwhether it is in Kenya or in South Africa.\r\nBut Gichamba is a man among men, challenging\r\nstereotypes and undertaking community\r\nawareness roles.\r\nDaily he ventures through the streets of\r\nKiandutu ~alling on patients, the majority\r\nof whom are women, to clean and bathe\r\nthem, cook for them, do their laundry,\r\nclean their houses and look after their children.\r\nOccasionally, he pulls a makeshift\r\nambulance through the narrow dirt roads\r\nof Kiandutu to take seriously ill patients\r\nneeding care to a care centre.\r\nCare is often regarded in\r\nAfrica as a woman's job,\r\nwhich is why men will seldom\r\nwork as care-givers. In\r\nthe local community, some\r\nmen call him brave, others\r\nsay he is insane. For\r\nGichamba, it does not matter\r\nwhat they say. \"It was\r\nnot men who helped me, it\r\nwas women and I would\r\nnot be alive if it was not for\r\nthe woman who helped\r\nme,\"\r\nThat woman is Josephine\r\nWanjini, who has lived with Gichamba: \"Aids is every.\r\nHIV for the p~st 13 years. one's disease.\"\r\nShe nursed Glchamba back\r\nto health in January this. \r\ndespite the fact that his health\r\nwas failing fast. He had been\r\nkicked out of two homes where\r\nhe sought shelter and was left\r\nwith nowhere to go but the\r\nKENW A Centre in Kiandutu.\r\nFollowing his recovery, Wanjini\r\ncounselled him about HIV/\r\nAids and convinced him to go\r\nfor an HIV antibody test,\r\nwhich came back positive.\r\nFor Gichamba, caring for people\r\nwho are sick with an HIV/\r\nAids-related illness is not just a\r\nwoman's job. \"This is not a\r\nman's or woman's disease -\r\nit is everyone's disease,\" he\r\nsays.The writer is the Advocacy and Media Adviyear\r\nwhen he was bed-ridden with TB. At sor for UNAIDS in soli/hem African\r\nthe time, Lucas had no idea that he had HIV,"}
