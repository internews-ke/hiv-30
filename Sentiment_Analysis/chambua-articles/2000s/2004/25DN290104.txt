         GMtechnology fails local potatoes
        Imported transgenic material did not withstand Virus challenge in the field.

                   years ago, has failed to improve Kenya's
                  rials to develop a virus resistance sweet-
        T          potato through biotechnology have failed.
                      US biotechnology,      imported three
        sweet potato. This has confirmed critic's fears that
        bio-engineered techniques tried elsewhere may not
        be replicated in Africa with similar results.
           The modified potato was launched in Kenya, in
        2001 by US special envoy, Dr Andrew Young, who
        had flown into the country for the occasion.
           Investigations,   on the transgenic crop, by
        KARl's Biotechnology Centre, say the technology
        has failed to produce a virus resistant strain.
        "There is no demonstrated advantage arising from
        genetic transformation using the initial gene con-
        struct," says a report by researchers, Dr Francis
        Nang'ayo, and Dr Ben Odhiambo.
           The transgenic potato was imported from Mon-
        santo in the US to Kenya for tests. The initial
        genetic engineering work was done at the Mon-
        s~nto laboratories, using virus-resistant technolo-
        gIes.
           In a nine-year study, Monsanto had developed a
        coat protein responsible for virus resistance, and
        donated it to Kari, royalty free, to use in its sweet
        potato improvement programme.
           "The transgenic material did not quite withstand
        virus challenge in the field," says the report, doubt-
        ing whether the gene expression was adequate or it
        failed to address the diversity of virus in this region
        or just that the gene construct was inappropriate.
           Actually, the report indicates that during the tri-
        als non-transgenic crops used as control yielded
        much more tuber compared to the trangenics. "All
        lines tested were susceptible to viral attacks."
           The Kari results corresponded with an earlier
        study released by the Third World Network - Afri-
        ca. The study, titled "Genetically Modified Crops
        and Sustainable Poverty         Alleviation    in Sub-
        Saharan Africa: An Assessment of Current Evi-
        dence", by Aaron deOrassi, of the Institute of
        Development Studies, University of Sussex, UK,
        had warned that the OM sweet potato introduced
        in Kenya did not address the crop's major problem
        - weevils.
           The study offered new' evidence against claims
        of the miracle potential of genetically modified
        crops for dealing with famine and poverty in
                                                                  One of Kari's field plots where the modifiedsweetpotato was tried. In the trials, non-transgenic crops us8clas control yielded much
