         As a youth, I was terrified and shocked at the incident that happened on 26th
    May 2004 where 15 remains of unborn babies were found at Ngong river bridge
   wrapped in plastic bags.
     , If you cannot bring up a child, please abstain because a farmer cannot sow
    if he does not need any harvest. It is sad.to note that most girls are left with the
   burden       of             bringing up a child by the irresponsible men while others
                               find it difficult or shameful to deliver a child at their age
                              .and they therefore prefer abortion. Abortion is murder
                                and its consequences can be worse as the victims death,
                                being barren and many more. To avoid these risks,lets be
