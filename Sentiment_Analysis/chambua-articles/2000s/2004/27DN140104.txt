      to go to hospital even when they are very sick

                       per
       long, especially in public hospitals, forcing them to
      wait for hours.
          This pushes the charges of hiring an interpreter
       beyond the means of many people, so they simply
       stay away or indulge in the easier option - self-                                                                                                                    Mwikali, left,
