     FOOD INSECURITY: A montage of a photographer's impressions of the effects of HIV/Aids on food security for two families in Butula,. Busia. In one family, Pascalia Odunga, 64,
     has lost four children to HIV, and now looks after 12 orphans. They often eat just one meal a day and sometimes nothing at all. The other family used to survive off the meagre
     income the father made fixing bicycles, but when he fell ill the family lost that as well. The World Food Programme has been working with the Kenya Government to provide food
     for thousands of Kenya infected and affected by the AIDS epidemic.
