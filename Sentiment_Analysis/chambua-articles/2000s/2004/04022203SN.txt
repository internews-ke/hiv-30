February 22,2004 \r\n\r\nPRESIDENT WAIVE TAX ON SANITARY PADS\r\n\r\nBY SUNDAY NATION CORRESPONDENT\r\n\r\nPresident Mwai Kibaki yesterday\r\nwaived the Valued Added Tax and\r\nother taxes levied on women's sanitary\r\n~els .\r\n. You shall not pay a cent more. 1\r\ninstruct that manufacturing companies,\r\ntraders and all those concerned to\r\nimmediately stop charging extra,\" the\r\nPresident said, amidst cheers and ululation\r\nfrom the women participants.\r\nThe President Kibaki was responding\r\nto a request by Health minister\r\nCharity Ngilu who pointed out that\r\nmany women were exposed to infections\r\nwhen they opt to use unhygienic\r\nalternatives like old blankets and toilet\r\npaper.\r\nThe President was officially opening\r\nof the First National Women's Conference\r\non HIV/Aids at Kasarani Sports\r\nGymnasium, Nairobi.\r\nNominated MP Njoki Ndung'u\r\npraised the move. \"We tried to engage\r\nthe previous government on this issue,\r\nbut we are ~appy with this great\r\nstride,\" she said, adding that sanitary\r\npads had been one of the highest taxed\r\ngoods.\r\nThe executive director of Fida, Ms\r\nJane Kirago, said part of their advocacy\r\ncampaign was to widen access of\r\nsanitary pads to poor women and girls\r\nin the rural areas. \"I am really excited\r\nabout the tax waiver. The biological\r\nprocess is not within our control,\" she\r\nsaid.\r\nA woman menstruates at least 12\r\ntimes a year, which translates to at\r\nleast 450 times from puberty to menopause.\r\nAt the cost of ShlOOa month, a\r\nwoman spends about Sh45,000 in her\r\nlifetime on sanitary Dads.\r\n\r\n\r\nAIDS: KIBAKI'S NEW DIRECTIVE\r\nBY OSCAR OBONYO\r\n\r\nIdentify all the HIV sufferers for assistance\r\nPresident Kibaki has directed that every\r\nHIV /Aids sufferer in each corner of the\r\ncountry be immediately identified for\r\npossible medical assistance.\r\nAnd to achieve this, the Head of State\r\nproposes that the Nation,al Aids Control\r\nCouncil (NACC) whittles down its composition\r\nand mandate right to the smallest\r\nadministrative unit - the village.\r\n\"Every village in every corner of this\r\ncountry should set up an HIV/Aids committee\r\nto identify those who are ailing\r\nfrom the disease. It is a lot easier to\r\nidentify them at this level as most are\r\neither family members or known neighbours,\"\r\nsaid the President.\r\nHe hopes that at the village level,\r\neach and every suff~rer is likely to be\r\ntracked down, identified, counselled and\r\nrequested to access medication.\r\n\"This is the only way we can corner\r\nthis 'thing' and wipe it out completely,\"\r\nhe told participants of the First National\r\nWomen's Conference on HIV/Aids in\r\nNairobi's Kasarani Sports Gymnasium\r\nyesterday.\r\nThe President was presiding over the\r\nofficial opening of the three-day event\r\nattended by 4,000 women. He appealed\r\nto all affected not to shy away from\r\nreality.\r\n\"We are taking the war to the village\r\nlevels because we want to assist each\r\nand everyone, especially those who are\r\nembarassed of their condition,\" he said\r\npleading with them to open up because\r\n\"hiding is tantamount to willingly\r\nwasting away to the grave\".\r\nThe first family, led by the President\r\nhimself, has been in the forefront in\r\nfighting the spread of the virus after\r\nofficially launching the campaigns in\r\nMarch last year.\r\nThe President was however not\r\naccompanied by the First Lady, Mrs\r\nLucy Kibaki, as has been the tradition\r\nsince he ascended to power in December\r\n2002.\r\nMrs Kibaki, a member of the\r\nOrganisation of African First Ladies\r\nAgainst Aids (OAFLA), has opened a\r\nKenyan chapter of the organisation and\r\nis a leading crusader of behaviour\r\nchange.\r\nSpeaking earlier, Health minister\r\nCharity Ngilu stressed the need to combat\r\nthe HIV/Aids scourge by focusing\r\non women.\r\n\"Women are the most vulnerable and\r\nmost helpless victims of this condition\r\nand that is why we thought it important\r\nto start our campaigns by involving this\r\nlot,\" she explained.\r\nBut the President appeared to contradict\r\nher when he reiterated the need to\r\ngive both men and women equal\r\ninvolvement opportunities in fighting\r\nagainst the pandemic.\r\n\"It is erroneous to tell men to wait as\r\nyou forge forward with the women.\r\nThese two should move together as\r\nnone should be left behind,\" he said\r\namidst cheers from the women\r\nparticipants."}
