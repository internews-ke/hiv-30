Lessons from the Orient

cies, this is the fastest growing region. And the biggest irony,
however, is that Kenya, which was on a par with these coun-
tries at independence 41 years ago, is retrogressing.
   Several decades ago, Kenya had a system that worked, and
its Civil Service functioned efficiently. Then, South Korea and
the other countries, now referred to as the Asian Tigers, often
sent their people to learn from us how to run their affairs.
   Today, the Asians are showcases of economic prosperity and
progress. As our own Planning and National Development
minister, Prof Peter Anyang Nyong'o, has noted, it's because
of the unprecedented pace of industrialisation in China and
other leading South Asian states such as South Korea, Taiwan,
Singapore, and Hong Kong, that the 21 century has come to be
known as 'the Asian Century'. In fact, even the First World is
now looking to Asia and it would be a fatal error of judgement
for Kenya, and Africa, in general, not to forge closer ties with
this new centre of global progress.
   And we couldn't agree more with Prof Nyong'o that if
Kenya is to reconfigure its economic strategy to overcome a
poverty rate that now afflicts a whopping 56 per cent of our
population, we must engage the fastest growing economic                                                                            Insight
