Muriuki\r\n(DC, Maragua) and Mrs Catherine Gatama\r\n(DC, Busia). The other female name that the presi\u00b7\r\ndent would hear is that of Mrs Jane Waikenda,\r\nDeputy PC, Eastern Province.\r\nHow would the President react to that roll call?\r\nMaybe by asking the Secretary to the Cabinet why\r\nthere are only\r\nfour women in\r\ninfluential positions\r\nin the provincial\r\nadministration.\r\nWere the President\r\nto call all\r\ncthoempmroI.SvSin.Icoinaelrs,\r\nit would be an\r\nall-male affair because there is no female provincial\r\ncommissioner.\r\nWhen Men for Gender Equality (MGE) called on\r\nthe Murang'a DC, Mrs Ng'etich on the seventh day\r\nof their ten\u00b7day campaign against gender-based violence\r\nand HIV/Aids in Central, Eastern and parts\r\nof Rift Valley provinces, she\"was thrilled to see\"men\r\nin the frontline of the fight against gender inequali\u00b7\r\nty.\r\n\"I'm lost of words, I wish this campaign started\r\nimmediately after independence, women would not\r\nbe a minority in decision-making positions,\" she\r\nsaid.\r\n\"We are looking forward to a time when our numbers\r\nshall increase both at the district and the provinciallevels\r\nso that our voices will be heard loud\r\nand clear,\" Ng'etich, who was posted to Murang'a\r\njust over a year ago, added.\r\nDenying women equal opportunities may be considered\r\nanother form of gender violence, said the\r\nprovincial adm inistra tor.\r\nThe MGE movement says it has identified men as\r\nthe major culprits in gender-based violence.\r\n\"Most men come from very closed cultures that still\r\nIllicit brew\r\nShe appealed to local politicians to join hands with\r\nher in making the area peaceful by telling men to\r\nspend their time in meaningful activities instead of\r\nspending the whole day idling on the streets.\r\nNyandarua District Officer One, Ernest Munyi,\r\nsaid the rate of consumption of illicit brew had\r\nincreased in the area. ~~Ourhands are full, we have\r\ncases of child molestation, street children, prostitution\r\nand consumption of illicit brew,\" he said.\r\nFrancis Mutie, the Nakuru District Officer One,\r\nraised the same concern.
