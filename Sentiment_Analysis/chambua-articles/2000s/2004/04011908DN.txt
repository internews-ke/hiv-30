In other words, people\r\nare dying unnecessarily because they cannot afford the\r\nproper medication.\r\n   Of all 300 million cases reported every year, 90 per cent\r\nare in Africa. In fact, malaria is killing 3,000 African children\r\nevery day.\r\n   But the real tragedy about the disease is that it can be\r\ntreated. Better still, it can be prevented.\r\n   Which brings us to some heart-warming news reported at\r\nthe weekend: Non governmental organisations and allied\r\ngroups have until April 5 to apply for funds from the United\r\nNation Global Fund for Aids, Malaria and Tuberculosis.\r\n   As things stand now, Aids is getting all the attention and\r\nfor a good reason. It is a bigger killer than any other disease\r\nat the moment. Malaria, on the other hand, remains at the\r\nbottom of the pile.
