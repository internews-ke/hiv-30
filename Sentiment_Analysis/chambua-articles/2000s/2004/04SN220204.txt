HEALTH THREATS AMID ACUTE DRUG SHORTAGE

BY VICTOR BWIRE
Kenya faces one of the worst health cri•
scs in recent years following a major
shortage of essential drugs.
The situation has been made worse
by the failure by the Ministry of Flealth
to buy tendered drugs meant to treat
killer diseases like malaria, tuberculosis
and HlVIAids.
Disease outbreak
Should any disease outbreak occur
now, the country would be in a critical
state as government stores have virtu
ally depleted their stocks of essential
drUgs.
The Ministry of Health has not
ordered new medical supplies for pub
lic hospitals since the 2002t2003 finan
cial year. More than Sh2 billion meant
for purchasing medical items is lying
idle on orders of Health Permanent
Secretary Wellington Godo.
Mr Godo confirmed issuing (he
orders, but blamed the delay on the
new government’s regulations that
require the ministry to slop buying
items through agents. He has, however.
directed the letters of offer for the
items to be sent out to the winning bid
ders. Should this be done, the earliest
the items can be received is July.
“Previously, the ministry bough t
medical stores through agents which
cost the government a lot of money in
commissions. We were instructed to
establish our own purchasing system,”
Mr Godo said.
A recent dispatch from the Kenya
Medical Supplies Agency (Kemsa)
logistics unit indicates that stocks of the
most essential items such as surgical
gloves, family planning pills and con
doms are vwtually depleted.
Lt is feared that with the onset of the
long rains any time from now, malaria-
prone areas could be hit badly.
HI V-positiv e
Similarly. the more than 200,000 HIV
positive people in urgent need of life
prolonging anti-retroviral treatment in
the country may be forced to wait for
another four months to access the
drugs.
Hopes of TB patients getting free
treatment are just a dream as most pub-
lic hospitals do not have the basic anti
biotics. The situation is the same for all
the other diseases.
While senior government officials
have been talking about plans for free
medical care for Kenyans, information
is emerging that the Country is sitting on
a time-bomb.
Tenders for the purchase of essential
drugs lo treat killer diseases were
advertised last year but stakeholders
have been claiming that there were
flaws.
The Kenya Coalition of Essential
Medicines said some of the advertised
drugs were non-existent, while drugs
for HLV-positive children and those
with TB had not been catered for.
Some of the losing bidders have
appealed to the ProcuremeRt and Ten
der Appeals Board. .
Mr Godo said the process of strength
ening the ministry’s internal procure
ment mechanism has just been finalised
and the orders will be issued any
time. The PS confirmed that the minis
try is yet to make any purchases this
financial year because of “echnical”
reasons.
“The delay has been caused by the
restructuring of the Kenya Medical Sup
plies Agency to make it the sole pur
chasing parastatal for all medical sup
plies to the government.” he said.
The continued delay in signing the
orders may also see the ministry lose its
vote to the Treasury in three months
time on expiry of the current financial
year.
