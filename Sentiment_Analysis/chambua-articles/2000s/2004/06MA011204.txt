          AMANI COUNSELLING CENTRE" TRAINING INSTITUTE'S
                     ROLE IN FIGHTING HIV/AIDS
         ACCTI, a non-profit making organization is this year celebrating 25 years of it's
         existence as the pioneer counselling and training model in Kenya and the region.
         Amani's vision is to restore human dignity. In this regard, Amani considers every
         human being worth of this dignity irrespective of their HIV status. Therefore, it
         (Amani) has taken a central role in the fight against HIV/AIDS by creating public
         awareness and supporting both the infected and affected through training, outreach
         counselling and supervision.
         HIV/AIDS training is offered in all Amani courses. In addition, it offers tailor-made
         HIV/AIDS courses for communities and other corporate clients such as banks,
         churches, schools and other care-giving communities. Amani also networks and
         partners with other organizations which are supporting the infected and affected.
         The effects of being HIV/AIDS infected are quite challenging and complex. HIV
         affects families, communities and organizations. Amani counsels the affected within
         psychological safety.    This is done by Amani's experienced, competent and
         committed counsellors. Counselling such clients can be stressful and emotionally
         draining. Amani offers support to the HIV/AIDS counsellors through counselling
         supervision.

           infection, including through engaging in healthy sexual behaviour change.
         • Support: The infected are psychologically supported so as to continue living
           productive lives. Also the students are taught how to support the infected for
           example through Home Based Care (HBC) training. Professional support is
           offered to the helpers through counselling supervision.
         • Stigma - reduction: Clients and students are helped to be aware and work on
           their negative and.unhealthy attitudes towards HIV/AIDS and the affected.
