March 28, 2004\r\n\r\nTHOUGHT OF SUNDAY\r\nSEX EDUCATION:\r\nTO TEACH OR NOT TO TEACH SCHOOL CHILDREN\r\nBY JOE BABENDRIEIER\r\n\r\nTen years ago Kenyans were embroiled\r\nin a debate over sex education in primary\r\nschools. Some NOOs were pushing\r\nor it. Many parents were trying to stop it.\r\nSeveral bills were proposed in Parliament. In\r\nthe end, the parents prevailed. More recently,\r\nwithout any fanfare or debate, the government\r\nissued a new syllabus. All children are\r\nnow deep into the details of sex. Primary textbooks\r\ndepict human reproductive organs as\r\nexplicitly as anything previously reserved for\r\nbiology lessons in Form 3, Under the title of\r\npreventing the spread of Aids, teachers are\r\nmandated by the new X-4-4syllabus to\r\ninstruct nine-year-old boys and girls all about\r\nacts proper to marital intimacy.\r\nSome of the textbooks recommend abstinence\r\noefore marriage, but others recommend\r\nusing condoms \"in case the children are\r\nthinking of having sex anytime soon\". Telling\r\nthis to 16-year-olds confuses them. Telling\r\nthis to 10-year-olds usually does permanent\r\ndamage, robbing them of their natural innocence.\r\nIt gets worse. The new textbooks written for\r\nthe new syllabus never come close to telling\r\nthe children the most important fact they\r\nneed to know. Having sex before marriage is\r\nalways wrong for everybody because it causes\r\nspiritual and emotional harm even when people\r\nmanage to avoid getting infected.\r\nParents used to get furious over these issues.\r\nWhere are they now? There are two answers.\r\nOn one hand, many of the parents who\r\nopposed the introduction of sex education in\r\nthe early 1990s no longer have children in primary\r\nschool. Ten years is a longtime. The\r\npolitical events of the last decade - everyone\r\nexamining their stake in the constitutional\r\nreview -have made it hard to focus on academic\r\nissues. On the other hand, morals have\r\ndegenerated. Today's pupils are the children\r\nof parents who grew up with that. Few of\r\nthese new parents care about schools teaching\r\nsex education. Most of them learned the\r\nbasics from friends or strangers, not from parents.\r\nThey managed to distance themselves\r\nfar enough from promiscuity to start a family.\r\nSo they have little idea of why sex education\r\nrequires parental involvement. Now that they\r\nhave their own children, they arc mainly worried\r\nabout HIV and other incurable infections.\r\nIt may be a bit late to sound the trumpet, but\r\nparents with little children should also be\r\nworried about dangers worse than disease.\r\nChildren struggle with gender identity: Boys\r\nwrestling with what it means to be male, girls\r\ndiscovering the feminine mystique. As adults\r\nwe forget how fragile they are. One mistake\r\ncan be psychologically fatal. Sex is profoundly\r\npersonal. Each child needs an individual\r\napproach when learning the facts of life.\r\nPutting lit~le boys and girls together in a classroom\r\nand showing them detailed drawings\r\nwhile explaining the act of sex is the worst\r\nway to introduce them to the origins of life. It\r\ncan do irreparable damage. If you are a parent,\r\nyour child could be one of the casualties.\r\nAfter 30 years of sex education in public\r\nschools in America and Europe, the prevalence\r\nrates for sexually transmitted diseases\r\nare higher than ever - and so are the number\r\nof men and women with sexual dysfunctions.\r\nLook at the male side of it. A father may feel\r\nembarrassed to sit down with his son and tell\r\nhim how a baby is born. Perhaps his own\r\nfather never explained it to him. That makes\r\nit doubly difficult. Even so, if he avoids talking\r\nto his son, the boy will one day wonder\r\nwhy everyo'ne feels guilty about the deed that\r\nexplains his existence - as if it were an act of\r\nprostitution the parents would rather forget.\r\nThis diminishes the boy's respect for his\r\nmother. If the father explains his love for his\r\nwife and how the boy was conceived in her\r\n. womb, the son will forever look at this\r\nwoman with a sense of awe and reverence.\r\nIf we want boys to learn how to treat women\r\nwith respect, we have to start here. A boy\r\ncannot respect other women until he respects\r\nhis own mother first. Women complain about\r\nbeing abused. The current programme of sex\r\neducation will only make things worse."}
