{"text": "\ufeffSunday Nation/ February 1, 2004\r\nFACTS ON AIDS VIRUS AND DISCORDANT COUPLES\r\n\r\nAmong the most challenging things that can happen in a relationship is the discovery\r\nthat one of the partners has\r\nthe HIV when the other doesn't.\r\nThese so-called \"discordant couples\"\r\nare surprisingly common. As Arthur Okwemba\r\nreported in the Daily Nation recently, to to 15\r\nper cent of couples are estimated to be discordant\r\nat Kenyatta National Hospital vcr centre.\r\nA testing centre in Zambia found a figure of 25\r\nper cent.\r\nSuch couples are placed under a huge strain -\r\nand many break up. You can understand why:\r\nThe fears; worries; stigmatisation; suspicions of\r\nunfaithfulness; and somehow the idea has got\r\naround that if you are infected you must have\r\nbeen promiscuous. Yet many negative partners\r\nare wonderful. They accept the fears and uncertainties.\r\nThey support their infected spouse\r\nthrough all the difficulties. And they are right to.\r\nBecause the relentlessly one-track messages\r\nwe've been getting are too simplistic. Some discordant\r\ncouples have had unprotected sex .\r\ntogether for many years without passing HIV\r\nfrom one to the other. Yet we're constantly told\r\ninfection is practically inevitable if you have sex\r\nwith someone who is positive.\r\nBut suddenly, even the statistics are in doubt.\r\nThe recent Kenya Demographic and Health Survey\r\nshowed an infection rate of 6.7 per cent.\r\nOver the past two years, UNAids estimates have\r\ndeclined from 15 to 9.4 per cent. The UNAids\r\napproach models total infection rates from antenatal\r\ntests, and ~ian Malan, a South African\r\nwriter, has made himself hugely unpopular by\r\npointing out how inaccurate this technique can\r\nbe. For example, an estimated 9.5 per cent at\r\nRand Afrikaans University proved to be over\r\neight times too high when real tests were done.\r\nSouth Africa's major banks ran HIV tests on\r\n29,000 staff. The testing gave a result below four\r\nper cent. The models said 12.\r\nNot only do infection rates seem lower than we\r\nhave been led tO'believe, but in fact \"normal\"\r\nsex does not seem to spread HIV all that easily.\r\nWherever it has been measured, including Africa,\r\nthe probability of transmission per contact\r\nranges from 1 in 200 to 1 in 2000 (male to\r\nfemale) and 1 in tO,OOO (female to male). And\r\nthe wide variation in the probabilities tells us\r\nthat the virus doesn't have things all its own\r\nway.\r\nSome things do greatly increase the risk, such as\r\na high viral load, especially during the acute\r\nphase of the illness and shortly after infection;\r\nanything that results in damaged skin or mucous\r\nmembranes, like \"dry sex\"; other sexually transmitted\r\ndiseases, especially herpes, which is a particular\r\nproblem as many people don't know\r\nthey're infected.\r\nBut there are also many things that reduce the\r\nchance of infection. Simple lubricants, for example,\r\nby protecting the skin and mucous membranes.\r\nCondoms, of course. Many investigations\r\nhave shown that males circumcised before\r\npuberty (but not afterwards) are highly protected.\r\nFor example, in one Ugandan study, none of\r\nthe circumcised males became infected. Transmission\r\nfrom circumcised males to females was\r\nalso reduced, but only for men with low viral\r\nloads.\r\nPeople whose \"Human Leucocyte Antigens\" do\r\nnot match are less likely to infect one another.\r\nTen per cent of Europeans have a mutation that\r\nseems to inhibit HIV infection. Population\r\ngeneticists at the University of California, USA,\r\nbelieve that it originally protected them against\r\nsmallpox, which was common there. It has also\r\nbeen suggested that smallpox vaccination may be\r\nprotective, although this hasn't been proved yet.\r\nSomehow it's also implied that HIV is a uniquely\r\nAfrican problem because there's more promiscuity\r\nhere. A dozen surveys have shown that is not\r\ntrue. But you hardly ever hear about other ways of\r\nspreading HIV, do you? And yet Dr David Gisselquist\r\nargues that studies linking Africans' sexual\r\nbehaviour to HIV transmission account for\r\nonly a third of infections. Many infected African\r\nadults have had no sexual exposure to HIV. Many\r\nHIV positive children have HIV negative mothers.\r\nMany African women become infected before and\r\nafter giving birth. What's going on?\r\nIt seems that HIV researchers during the 1980s\r\ninvestigated patients at sexually transmitted disease\r\nclinics in Africa - and never really questioned\r\ntheir results. But people there were often\r\ntreated by injection. Equipment was often not\r\nproperly sterilised. And HIV can survive in\r\nsyringes at room temperature for over four weeks.\r\nThe risk of contracting HIV from a contaminated\r\nneedle has been c;stimated at up to seven per cent.\r\nOne investigation tested 80 syringes and found\r\nHIV in three of them. Many studies now show 20\r\nto 40 per cent of HIV infections in African adults\r\nare associated with injections.\r\nThere is complete agreement that in North America,\r\nEurope, and many parts of Asia, HIV is primarily\r\nspread by contaminated needles. And by\r\nanal intercourse - where tissue damage is common.\r\nWhy should Africa be any different?\r\nDon't imagine that the practice is unknown in\r\nAfrica. It's just that no one speaks about it. But\r\nit's common among some groups - both male\r\nand female. Some women do it in order to avoid\r\n\"losing their virginity\". Many because since it's\r\nnever mentioned in HIV campaigns, they think\r\nit's safer that way!\r\nI guess a long term discordant couple is likely to\r\nhave had all the risk factors in their favour -\r\nmaybe genetically, certainly behaviourally. Their\r\nchallenge is to keep them that way. And no one\r\nshould assume that the one who is infected has\r\nbeen unfaithful.\r\nThey could have acquired the virus through no\r\nfault of their own. Discordant couples must do\r\neverything they can - together - to remain\r\nhealthy and prevent transmission to the negative\r\npartner. Even those who refuse to use condoms\r\n- and face it, many do. By using a lubricant. By\r\ntreating other sexually transmitted diseases. By\r\nreducing viral load: anti-retroviral treatment\r\nreally works.\r\nAbove all, they should stick together, be faithful,\r\nsupport and look after one another. Because in\r\nmany ways, the most terrible thing about HIV'\r\nnow is the fear and depression it causes. But\r\nevery day we learn more about the disease - and\r\nit will be beaten. More people now understand\r\nthat we should not reject people living with the\r\nvirus. They can lead good and healthy lives and\r\npresent little risk to other people. And they may\r\nwell have been infected through no fault of their\r\nown...\r\nDr Hart is a scientist and psychologist working in\r\nNairobi. E-mail: nyumbayangu@mac.com"}
