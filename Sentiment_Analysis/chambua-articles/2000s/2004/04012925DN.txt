This has confirmed critic's fears that\r\n        bio-engineered techniques tried elsewhere may not\r\n        be replicated in Africa with similar results.\r\n           The modified potato was launched in Kenya, in\r\n        2001 by US special envoy, Dr Andrew Young, who\r\n        had flown into the country for the occasion.\r\n           Investigations,   on the transgenic crop, by\r\n        KARl's Biotechnology Centre, say the technology\r\n        has failed to produce a virus resistant strain.\r\n        \"There is no demonstrated advantage arising from\r\n        genetic transformation using the initial gene con-\r\n        struct,\" says a report by researchers, Dr Francis\r\n        Nang'ayo, and Dr Ben Odhiambo.\r\n           The transgenic potato was imported from Mon-\r\n        santo in the US to Kenya for tests. The initial\r\n        genetic engineering work was done at the Mon-\r\n        s~nto laboratories, using virus-resistant technolo-\r\n        gIes.\r\n           In a nine-year study, Monsanto had developed a\r\n        coat protein responsible for virus resistance, and\r\n        donated it to Kari, royalty free, to use in its sweet\r\n        potato improvement programme.\r\n           \"The transgenic material did not quite withstand\r\n        virus challenge in the field,\" says the report, doubt-\r\n        ing whether the gene expression was adequate or it\r\n        failed to address the diversity of virus in this region\r\n        or just that the gene construct was inappropriate.\r\n           Actually, the report indicates that during the tri-\r\n        als non-transgenic crops used as control yielded\r\n        much more tuber compared to the trangenics. \"All\r\n        lines tested were susceptible to viral attacks.\"\r\n           The Kari results corresponded with an earlier\r\n        study released by the Third World Network - Afri-\r\n        ca.
