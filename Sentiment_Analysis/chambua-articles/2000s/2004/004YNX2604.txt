VIEWS ON THE CHILL CAMPAIGN

In this era of HIV and AIDS it would
benefi t our country if we all chill. I
would not like young Kenyans who
are leaders of tomorrow to die
young. We are only morally upright
when we do the will of God by
not engaging in pre-marital sex
and keeping away from drugs.
The youth should focus on useful
activities like charity work and sports
to keep off peer pressure that might
lead them in the wrong direction
