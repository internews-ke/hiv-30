{"text": "\ufeffDaily Nation/ June 23, 2004\r\n\r\nTHE PACKAGE THAT CHANGED MY LIFE\r\nCONTINUED FROM PAGE 1\r\n\r\nbehind my visit to the centre, to which I calmly\r\nresponded: 'Ningependa kujua hali yangu ya\r\nmaisha. '( I would like to know my HIV status.) The\r\nfriendly counsellor nodded reassuringly. With this\r\nencouragement, I rattled on, \" you know I have so\r\nmany lovers but there is one whom I have not seen\r\nfor too long. I do not know her whereabouts.\"\r\n\"Nyawira then asked whether I had any information\r\nabout HIV/Aids. I told her that I had heard my\r\nfriends talk about it. I also informed her thatukihanya\r\nhanya - if one gets involved in casual sex -\r\nchances of contracting the virus are ver)'lhigh.\r\n\"I was confident through most of the session,\r\ncalmly answering the counsellor's questions. But\r\nwhen she asked me whetber I knew how to use a\r\ncondom properly, I was thrown off balance. At\r\nfirst, I asserted with a qualified yes but when she\r\nasked me to demonstrate how to use it with the aid\r\nof a wooden penile object, I blushed and remained\r\nmotionless in my seat.\r\n\"Nyawira discovered that I was stuck but told me\r\nnot to worry and then took charge of the lesson.\"Like any person who wants to take an HIV\r\ntest, I was required to sign a form indicating that I\r\nhad consented to the test.\r\n\"When everything had been explained to me, I\r\nmustered the courage to take test. As I patiently\r\nwaited for my results, counsellor Nyawira\r\nindulged me in a light conversation.\r\nI confided in her that I dropped out of Jamhuri\r\nPgma!y School in 1994, when I was in Standard\r\nThree. I was the biggest boy in our class and every\r\ntime something went wrong, the younger pupils\r\nshouted out my name. On several occasions, I was\r\npunished for cr:imes I never committed. '\r\n\"I have very many friends at Kerima base -\r\nthe parking lot a between Jogoo House and the\r\nUchumi Supermarket on Agha Khan Walk in Nairobi.\r\nIf you go there and ask.for Mbugua Gunior)\r\nwith a missing tooth, you will be told that I shifted\r\nbase to the Kenyatta Market base.\r\n'Finally, the long-awaited moment arrived. The\r\nbespectacled counsellor asked me whether I could\r\nread my own results. 'From the explanation you\r\ngave me before taking my blood sample, I do not\r\nhave the virus that causes Aids,' I declared.\r\n\"The counsellor confirmed that I was right and\r\nwent on to give me som I tips on how to avoid getting\r\ninfected with the virus th lt causes Aids, as well as\r\nhow to live positively w' ~ the virus.\r\nLater, she offered ~ a cup of tea and escorted\r\nme to the gate with a $pecial gift: 300 condoms. I\r\nshared them with my fr \u00a2nds but also kept some, just\r\nin case ..\r\nMy girlfriend, Monic , who lives in Mbotela, Nai\u00b7\r\nrobi, was overwhelmed ith joy on hearing that I was\r\nHIV-free. My fellow st e': boys and girls respect me\r\nmore ever since news my courageous act reached\r\nthem. In fact, some of hem said they would follow\r\nsuit but they haven't mustered the courage to do so\r\nyet.,\r\n\"Now that I know that I am not infected with the\r\nAids-causing virus, I am seriously going to start trying\r\nto get an Identity Card, ev~n though the cumbersome\r\nprocedures involved make it very difficult\r\nfor a street boy to have one. I would also like to\r\ntrain as a driver.\r\n\"I'd like to appeal to street families, as well as\r\nmembers of public who have not yet gone for the\r\nAids to do so. No one can force you to take the test\r\nbut it is good to know the state of your health.   "}
