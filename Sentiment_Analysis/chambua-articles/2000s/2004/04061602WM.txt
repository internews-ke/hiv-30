The wars caused more than 8 million people\r\nto become refugees, returnees or displaced persons.\r\n,\r\n, At the same time, there is pervasive violence in\r\nboth the industrialised and developing countries\r\nthat runs through children and women in their families\r\nand communities, in themass media and entertainment.\r\nThe incidence of violence within the family,\r\nthough hidden from the public and statistics, is\r\nalmost certainly the most persistent, sparing no\r\nsociety or culture as it trickles down from one generation\r\nto the next, turning children reared on violence\r\ninto violent adults. '\r\nHowever, in ~frica, the social and economic d,evastation\r\ncaused by HIV/Aids in the last decadc: is\r\ngreater than the combined destruction of the\r\ncontinent's wars.\r\nAn estimated 200,000 Africans, most of them\r\nwomen and children died as a result of conflicts in\r\n1998 while 2 million people were killed by HIV/\r\nAids.\r\nFrom country to country, the pandemic has\r\nswept through sub-Saharan Africa, where 23.3\r\nmillion people, mainly the young, poor and powerless\r\n- girls and women in particular - now live\r\nwith HIV/Aids.\r\nWhile the educated have access to\r\nthe necessary information to protect\r\nthemselves from the virus, the life- Most a'ff:ected saving information is not finding its I(JJ {\r\n~~~. to those with little or no educa- by poverty\r\nAround Africa, HIV/Aids is spread- \u2022\r\ning the web of poverty and chronic atV\"e'chl)ldtV\"en insecurity in many societies, especially , I (;, I\r\nthose burdened by heavy national d debt. The stress on their limited social an women services is unbearable.\r\nA decline in food production has led\r\nto poorer nutrition and greater vulnerability to illness.\r\nLower education budgets mean less schooling\r\nfor boys and girls, who are later less able to\r\ndefend themselves against violence and abuse.\r\nAccording to State of the World's Children 2004\r\nreport, there are an estimated 11 million children\r\norphaned by HIV /Aids in sub-Saharan Africa, and\r\nthese are often the first children to lose the\r\nsupport of extended families for their attending\r\nschool, and double orphans are even less likely to\r\nattend school.\r\nGirls lose out more than boys because the burden\r\nof caring for sick relatives falls disproportionately on\r\nthem. In many families, ,the report notes, HIVrelated\r\nillnesses and the c nsequent loss in earnings\r\nmake sending a child to sc pol impossible.\r\nAfter families, educatio iis the next perimeter of a\r\nprotective environment fo 'children since schools can\r\nbe a powerful protective force\r\nin m st children's lives, especially\r\nfor girls and those who are\r\nhigh!
