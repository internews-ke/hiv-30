Traditionally blood donation is\r\n  not a very popular event in Kenya. Now with the advent of HIV, this\r\n  problem has been further compounded.\r\n      The Armed Forces and the prisons had been the main sources of\r\n  blood in most parts of this country. The result of all this has been a\r\n  drastic reduction of the blood donor pool. Says Dr Njoroge Gichuhi:\r\n  \"That means patients die because of postponed operations rather\r\n   than lack of blood. In this case their relatives are usually unable to\r\n   link blood scarcity with the deaths.\"\r\n    , To save lives and counter the dwindling blood donation levels,\r\n    medical experts call for a radical, urgent and decisive action on the\r\n    part of both the government and the private sector.\r\n       The advent of HlV/Aids has also had a negative response from\r\n    recipients of blood. Even in the US, considered to have the safest\r\n    blood supply, opinion surveys have it that a full one-third of the pub-\r\n    lic disagrees with official statements that \"the blood supply is safe\"\r\n    and that they would agree to accept blood transfusion if hospitalized.\"\r\n      The lack of enough blood in the banks, doubts over its safety and\r\n    other clinical complications that could arise from a transfusion have\r\n    kept up the search for ways to eliminate blood transfusions.\r\n       \"It is not as if we have reached a cul-de-sac, there are several appli-\r\n    cable and already tried alternatives to whole blood transfusions, but\r\n    these must be adopted sooner than later,\" says a senior gynaecologist\r\n    at KNH.\r\n    Bloodless medicine\r\n    One area that has been identified as a possible candidate for newer\r\n    technologies in 'bloodless medicine' is anaemia\r\n          Anemia is one of the major causes of admission or prolonged hos-\r\n    pital stay which impact on hospital bills. Anemia occurs when the\r\n    body isn't able to produce enough healthy red blood cells.\r\n          This can happen because of a deficiency of iron or certain other\r\n     substances in the body or from inherited defects or diseases that inter-\r\n     fere with the production of red blood cells\r\n          Iron is essential for the production of hemoglobin in red blood\r\n     cells. Poor dietary iron intake (or excessive loss of iron from the\r\n     body) leads to iron-deficiency anemia.\r\n           Blood loss such as that associated with schistosomiasis, hookworm\r\n      infestation, hemorrhage in childbirth and trauma can also result in\r\n      both iron deficiency and anemia.\r\n           There is now a greater awareness of the importance of preventing\r\n      and treating anemia especially that related to iron-deficiency. ,New\r\n       research suggests that this deficiency can be corrected with oral iron\r\n       therapy, which is relatively safe and inexpensive.\r\n           However, for severe anaemia, blood transfusion has been the only\r\n       way to correct the situation. But emerging issues of availability and\r\n       safety of blood, points to a need to reduce blood transfusion. Diseases\r\n        that can be transmitted through blood include HlV, hepatitis A, B,\r\n        and C and malaria among others.\r\n            Clinicians now know that it is possible to help the body compensate\r\n        for blood loss during surgery without the use of donor blood. For\r\n        example, a number of approved pharmaceutical agents are used to\r\n         treat or prevent anaemia. These mainly include parenteral iron and\r\n         erythropoietin, which are typically used prior to surgery.t0 stimulate\r\n              bone marrow's production of red blood cells. These same agents\r\n           a be used after surgery to rebuild the red blood mass.\r\n            Using the experience gained in renal medicine, it is now possible to\r\n          produce increased numbers of the patient's own red cells across sur-\r\n          gery, during chemotherapy,        after chronic blood loss and in\r\n          immunosupression.\r\n       Intravenous iron\r\n       For those patients who for one reason or another have decided not to\r\n           Experience has shown that planned surgery and anaemia that may\r\n       receive any blood transfusion, the use of a safe intravenous iron and                                                                                                                                                          -\r\n       recombinant human erythropoietin has proved to be very successful.\r\n        arise due to blood loss can be dealt with effectively by stimulating the\r\n        production of red cells prior to or after surgery. Severe anaemia too\r\n        can be treated with safe intravenous iron.                                                                                                                                                                                    \u2022\r\n            Intravenous iron has always been treated as potentially dangerous\r\n        to the body.
