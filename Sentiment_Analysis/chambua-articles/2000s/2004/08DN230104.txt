Police need more than cash
        he Police Force is reputed to be one of the most
        for money. In its pursuit, service must suffer. An
T       corrupt institutions. And corruption is not just greed
institution which is supposed to prevent crime has eventually
become the personification of crime.
   So the question arises: How can Kenyans be asked to
maintain such an organisation? Do its members deserve a
pay rise, especially of the magnitude that the Government
announced on Wednesday?
   Our answer, nevertheless, is yes, because the force is
essential. Moreover, the rot can, in a sense, be traced to the
extremely poor pay the police get.
   A boost in cash earnings might go some way towards
cleaning up the filth. There is only one scruple. Where
bribery has become a dominant thought-habit, it may require
much more than cash to put paid to it.
   Indeed, in the long run, payment in kind might prove
infinitely more effective than cash, which, being inherently
corruptive, is not guaranteed to be spent on real needs. A
better and subsidised house is a different story.
   Why does a Government which is perennially
cash-strapped and which - because of it - is perpetually at
loggerheads with such other essential services as the teaching
profession - think that cash is the only way it can improve
its employees' conditions?                                                                                                          DOUBLE LOSS 0 LUCY OR lANG'
   Why does each service have a pay structure completely
separate from that of every other? We have only one public
service. So what we need is a single general emolument                                          Time to cut your losses,"'¥vonne

   It is true that some services have special skills which
require special rewards. But the fact is, at present, various
Government services have pay structures too contradictory                                              he headline was guaranteed                                                                                         either dropped out of the limelight or died.
