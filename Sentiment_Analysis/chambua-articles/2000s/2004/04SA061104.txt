HEALTH:
OBEL TELLS OF ANOTHER AIDS WONDER DRUG

By Nation Reporter
Controversial Aids researcher Arthur
Obel has announced the development
of yet another drug.
Code-named Compound Q27, it is
derived from almunda canuta, a tropical
plant which is found in Kenya and many
other parts of Africa, he said.
This is the third Aids drug to be
announced by the professor after Kem-,
ron in 1990 and 1997's Pearl Omega.
At a news conference in his Nairobi
office, an upbeat Obel claimed Cpd Q27
was not just for managing HIV or Aids,
but "a proven cure" that removed all
traces of the virus from the entire body
system, and not just the blood.
"We are talking about total deconversion
from HIV -positive to negative.
Even when biopsies of the lymph glands
and other tissues are taken, no trace of
the virus has been found in some of our
patients," he noted.
He said that since January, he had
treated 320 patients, 44 of whom had
been cleared of the
virus.
. "This is much
more potent than
Pearl Omega and
we are very excited
about the results,
hence our decision
to annoance the
preliminary findings
at this stage."
Prof Obel said
the drug is pre- Prof Obel
pared from the
plant's sap, which is then boiled and the
paste dried and ground into a fine powder.
"The powder is 100 per cent insoluble
in water, which means that the drug
cannot be prepared as a water solution,"
he said.
"However, it is 100 per cent soluble
in alcohol and we are administering it in
the form of a syrup or as an injectable."
The drug, he said, was superior to the
locally available foreign anti-retrovirals
because it is administered as a. ~
compound, and does not nee~
combined with any other compound ..
"It works as a monotherapy and is
administered once a day, ideally at bedtime,"
he told journalists.
He said that, unlike Pearl Omega,
which cost, as much as Sh30,000 per
dose, the drug is extremely cheap. "For
the price of a banana, you will be able
to get a dose of Q27," he said.
