{"text": "\ufeffDaily Nation August 11,2004\r\n\r\nSPREADING THE VIRUS - DELIBERATELY\r\n\r\nAfter she learnt about re-infection, she says, she\r\nhas changed her behaviour radically. \"I'm no\r\nlonger interested in lovers and ignore those who\r\ncome looking for me. I have also stopped drinking.\r\nIn fact, my body is reacting to alcohol. Every time I\r\ndrink, I sweat, vomit and eventually get a sore\r\nthroat. \"\r\nThen, she laughs.\r\nWesonga's story\r\nWamukoya Wesonga is seething with rage. His eldest\r\ndaughter was intentionally infected with Aids\r\nlast January by a man who knew he was dying.\r\nThe 16-year-old was fatally attracted to a man\r\nfrom the city: he was a man with style and class, so\r\ndifferent from the common villagers. But the nine\r\ndays she spent with him have left her with a lifelong\r\ndisease and regrets. \"\r\nThe man, now deceased, had come home to Kanjele\r\nvillage to die when on the advice of his Nairobi\r\ndoctor. But his relatives didn't want him to die\r\nwithout a wife to perform the final rites upon his\r\ndeath, so they got him Wesonga's daughter.\r\nWesonga was disturbed when news about the\r\nman's lifestyle in Nairobi reached him. He was told\r\nthat the man's Ugandan wife had died of Aids, and\r\nthat he, too, was ailing.\r\n\"In February, I asked'my father to go and find\r\nout about my daughter's new home, which is not far\r\nfrom here, as I was travelling to Eldoret, where I\r\nwork as a mason. But my father was treated badly\r\nby the people there. They denied knowledge of my\r\ndaughter's presence in the home,\" says the father of\r\nsix bitterly.\r\nWhen he returned home briefly in April, Wesonga,\r\naccompanied by two friends, visited the home.\r\nHis son-in-law was ill and lying on a mat in his\r\nmother's house, and Wesonga's daughter was taking\r\ncare of him.\r\nThe man's parents told Wesonga that their son\r\nwas just suffering from diarrhoea, which they attributed\r\nto the village food, which was different from\r\nwhat he was used to in the city.\r\nBut the sight of the man and his daughter beside\r\nhim hurt Wesonga so much that he went straight to\r\na local organisation - Rural Education and Economic\r\nProgramme (REEP) - for help. When he\r\neXplained his predicament to them, they immediately\r\nwent and rescued his daughter from the home.\r\nHe appeals to the Government to take serious\r\nsteps and punish those who infect others deliberately\r\nbecause they \"don't want to die alone.\"\r\n\"These people should be arrested and prosecuted.\r\nThis will serve as a warning to others. Once the\r\nGovernment criminalises malicious spread of Aids\r\nand arrests the culprits, this behaviour will be\r\ncurbed.\"\r\nThose willingly spreading the disease are ignorant,\r\nsays Wesonga. In fact, they put themselves at\r\nrisk of re-infection.\r\nAlice's* story\r\nShe sniffs and wipes her eyes with the back of her\r\nhand. It has been four years since heR\r\nbrother-in-law defiled her and infected her with\r\nHIV when she was only 11, but the memory of the\r\nincident is still as raw as if it happened yesterday.\r\nIt was a Sunday morning and her sister had gone\r\nto church, leaving her behind to do household\r\nchores at their Kabras home. Her brother-in-law,\r\nwho had also stayed at home because he was\r\nunwell, pounced on the little girl as she swept the\r\n. kitchen, tore her clothes and defiled her.\r\n\"When he was through he laughed and said, 'My\r\nmother will bury me but yours will bury you and\r\nyour sister. And if you tell anyone I will slaughter\r\nyou.' I wanted to die there and then before my sister\r\ncame from church. It was the most horrible\r\nmoment of my life.\"\r\nWhen her sister came back, she found the young\r\ngirl sulking, her chores unfinished. \"I want to go\r\nhome now,\" was all she said. She would not eat or\r\ndo anything else.\r\nThat was in June 2000. The young girl's sister had\r\nwithdrawn her from Standard Four in Butula only\r\nsix months earlier and taken her to Kabras to work\r\nfor her as a househelp since she herself was sickly.\r\nThe day after the incident, the two sisters set off for\r\ntheir Butula home. It was only il) the safety of\r\nhome that the young girl told her sister what had\r\nhappened.\r\n\"My sister was shocked but she didn't say anything.\r\nSoon afterwards, she died of Aids, and was\r\nfollowed by her husband. Now I take care of one of\r\ntheir two sons, who is eight,\" she says softly.\r\nA year after her ordeal, she tested HIY-positive.\r\nAn aunt took her for testing after she fell ill and\r\nseemed incurable. The nurse at the Voluntary\r\nCouncelling and Testing centre gave her medicine\r\nfor her dry cough. Apart from her aunt, who took\r\nher for the test, nobody else knows about her status.\r\nIt is a well-guarded secret, not known to her\r\nteachers, friends or siblings. She would die if they\r\ngot to know, she says. Her mother, who died last\r\nyear, did not know. She lost her father when she\r\nwas five.' ~\r\nShe pushes her illness to the back of her mind ~\r\nand, although her sister disrupted her education, the girl, now 15 and in Standard Six, is determined\r\nto study hard and become a paediatrician.\r\nNdubi's story\r\nAfter passing her Kenya Certificate of Primary\r\nEducation examination, Janet Okinyi Ndubi was all\r\nready to go to Form One. But her father told her\r\nthat he would not pay fees for her because she was\r\nlikely to get pregnant and drop out of school, like\r\nher sister had done earlier. She decided to stay put\r\nand wait for her brother, who proceeded to secondary\r\nschool, to finish. She wanted to show her father\r\nthat she had neither pregnancy nor marriage on her\r\nmind.\r\nA year after her brother did his Kenya Secondary\r\nCertificate of Education, Ndubi went to visit an\r\naunt, who was married in Butula. After a short\r\nwhile, her aunt introduced her to a widower, whom\r\nshe recommended highly to Ndubi.\r\nWith no hope of getting a job, marriage appeared\r\nthe next best option. \"I liked him and soon, I\r\nmoved in with him.\"\r\nNdubi took her new role as wife and stepmother\r\nto the man's three children. She got three children\r\nof her own but when she went for antenatal tests\r\nduring her last pregnancy in 1999, she tested HIVpositive\r\n..\r\n\"I was devastated. I went to my aunt and asked\r\nher why she had introduced me to a man whose\r\nwife had died of Aids and who was obviously\r\ninfected. My aunt assured me she didn't know he.&oil\r\nwas infected, so I confronted my husband an(l\"\"\"l\"\"asked him to be tested. He, too, was positive.\"\r\nHer husband worked as a cook for missionaries\r\nand left Ndubi at home with the children. What\r\nhurts her is the fact that he deliberately infected her\r\nCONTINUED ON PAGE 8\r\n\r\n\r\nTRADITION AND GOOD SENSE IN CONFLICT\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTINUED FROM PAGE 1\r\nsure I am not infected,\" says Grace Adhiambo,\r\nwhose husband, Ochanda, returned home\r\nrecently after six years in remand.\r\nShe says she doesn't want to infect him\r\nbecause, while Ochanda was in custody, she married\r\nanother man but he died a few months later\r\nafter falling sick. She suspects he might have died\r\nof Aids.\r\n\"She was categorical that we use protection\r\neven after we went for an HIV test and we both\r\ntested negative,\" says Ochanda. \"We are hopeful\r\nthat we will still tcst neagative when we go for a\r\nfollow-up tcst.\"\r\nNear Bumula, ahout five kilometers from\r\nButula on the Kisumu Busia road, a man narrowly\r\nescaped infection when his first wife intervened\r\nhefore he could travel to Eldoret, where he\r\nworks. He was going there with his third wife.\r\nwho had just returned from llganda after nearly\r\n10 years of separation.\r\n\"Not until hoth l1fyou go for an HIV test,\" his\r\nfirst wife stubbornly said.\r\n\"No prohlem:' the man said confidently. As he\r\npedalled to the vel' centre in Butula, with his\r\nyoungest wife at the hack of the hicycle. the man\r\nwould occasionally use the woman's leso to wipe\r\nhis hrow.\r\nWhen they were told their results. the man did\r\nnot want to sit anywhere near his wife, \"I used\r\nher leso to wipe myself, do you think I will he\r\ninfected?\" he asked anxiously.\r\nUnknown to him, his wife had married another\r\nman during their separation and even had two\r\n\"These people should be arrested and prosecuted.\r\nThis will serve as a warning to others. Once the\r\nGovernment criminalises malicious spread of Aids\r\nand arrests the culprits, this behaviour will be\r\ncurbed.\"\r\nThose willingly spreading the disease are ignorant,\r\nsays Wesonga. In fact, they put themselves at\r\nrisk of re-infection.\r\nAlice's* story\r\nShe sniffs and wipes her eyes with the back of her\r\nhand. It has been four years since her\r\nchildren, both of whom had died.\r\nThey left the vel' separately, with the man\r\nwarning his wife that he did not want to see her at\r\nhis home again. But his first wife promised to take\r\ncare of her, saying it was up to her co-wife to\r\ndecide whether she wanted to stay or go away.\r\nDespite this high level of understanding of\r\nHIV/Aids, Butula is also a land of contrasts, and\r\nharmful'traditions that fire the spread of the disease\r\nare passionately upheld. Wife inheritance is\r\na practice that is close to the people's hearts and\r\nyet it is one of the modes of infection. A widow\r\nmust be inherited ito \"cleanse\" her after the\r\ndeath of her hushand.\r\nThose who refuse to be inherited become outcasts\r\nand will watch helplessly as their houses fall\r\nto ruins since no man will risk repairing it for her\r\nlest he be cursed.\r\nBesides, there arc those widowed very\r\nyoung, like 21-year-old Christine Awori,\r\nwho married at 1(i and was widowed at IS.\r\nEarly this year, she got herself a hoyfriend. a\r\nteacher at a local school. When her parents found\r\nout, they approached the teacher and asked him\r\nwhether he knew that their daughter was infected.\r\n\"He thought my parents werc lying and when I\r\nconfirmed to him that I had actually tested positive,\r\nhe still refused to believe m,' and accompanied\r\nme to the YCT. When the counsellor told\r\nhim ahout my status, he gave me Sh90 for fare\r\nand that was the last time I saw him.\"\r\nThen there are those derailing the fight against\r\nthe pandemic, including widows with a lot of\r\nmoney. They entice young men and since they are\r\nthe ones holding the purse strings, they set the\r\nrules in the affair.\r\nJane Ndubi, left, was infected by her hus\u00b7\r\nband. Above, a bitter Wamukoya Wesonga,\r\nwhose daughter was knowingly infected by\r\nthe man she married.\r\nbrother-in-law defiled her and infected her with\r\nHIV when she was only 11, but the memory of the\r\nincident is still as raw as if it happened yesterday.\r\nIt was a Sunday morning and her sister had gone\r\nto church, leaving her behind to do household\r\nchores at their Kabras home. Her brother-in-law,\r\nwho had also stayed at home because he was\r\nunwell, pounced on the little girl as she swept the\r\n. kitchen, tore her clothes and defiled her.\r\n\"When he was through he laughed and said, 'My\r\nmother will bury me but yours will bury you and\r\nyour sister. And if you tell anyone I will slaughter\r\nyou.' I wanted to die there and then before my sister\r\ncame from church. It was the most horrible\r\nmoment of my life.\"\r\nWhen her sister came back, she found the young\r\ngirl sulking, her chores unfinished. \"I want to go\r\nhome now,\" was all she said. She would not eat or\r\ndo anything else.\r\nThat was in June 2000. The young girl's sister had\r\nwithdrawn her from Standard Four in Butula only\r\nsix months earlier and taken her to Kabras to work\r\nfor her as a househelp since she herself was sickly.\r\nThe day after the incident, the two sisters set off for\r\ntheir Butula home. It was only il) the safety of\r\nhome that the young girl told her sister what had\r\nhappened.\r\n\"My sister was shocked but she didn't say anything.\r\nSoon afterwards, she died of Aids, and was\r\nfollowed by her husband. Now I take care of one of\r\nMalicious spread of Aids is a serious problem\r\nhere. Some of the infected say they don't want to\r\ndie alone. One man chased his wife from his\r\nhome because she had refused to \"spread the\r\nvirus and kill as many as possible before we die\".\r\nAlthough in Butula a woman can marry more\r\nthan one husband, she is not allowed to repair her\r\nhouse. Since tradition supercedes the fear of\r\nAids, a widow will easily accept to be inherited by\r\na brother-in-law or her husband's cousin just so\r\nthat he can repair her house or build her a new\r\none.\r\nThat was Mildred Atieno's predicament when\r\nthe roof of her house caved in. Although she\r\nknew she had Aids, she did not divulge this to her\r\ninheritor and told him that her husband was\r\nkilled through witchcraft.\r\nEncouraging people to go for testing has also\r\nbecome counterproductive. \"So, what next after\r\ntesting?\" asks Makokha. \"Without lifelong counselling,\r\nthose infected get withdrawn and are\r\nlikely to engage in dangerous behaviour.\"\r\nMakokha says the government must go a step\r\nfurther in the fight against Aids and help those\r\nwith HIV live productive lives by training them in\r\nincome-generating activities. It should also give\r\nthem soft loans to them start businesses.\r\nShe proposes another radical step: \"The yeT\r\ncards given to clients don't indicate one's status.\r\nThis has made it possible for some people to fool\r\ntheir partners by telling them that their status\r\nwould be indicated on the card if they were\r\ninfected. This would not happen if one's status\r\nwas clearly stated on the card.\"\r\nThis proposal is likely to generate a lot of heat,\r\nbut it is time effective ways were found to win the\r\nwar against Aids, says Makokha."}
