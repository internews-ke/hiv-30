"Sons of Africa rise and fight
In the name of great Africa ..
We shall fight and conquer Aids.
Daughters of Africa rise and fight
In the name of great Africa.,.
We shall fight and conquer Aids. "
This is the song sung by former Zam-
bian President Kenneth Kaunda when
he opened an Aids conference organ-
ised by the Conservation Corporation of
Africa at Kichwa Tembo Camp in Maa-
sai Mara National Park on Wednesday.
   Dr Kaunda is not a musician, but
together with son Waza, they have tra-
versed the world to preach against Aids.
   Dr Kaunda and South Africa's
Inkatha Freedom party leader Mongu-
suthu Buthelezi are among of the few
world leaders who have gone public and
revealed that their sons died of Aids.
The former president is yet to come to
terms with the death of his youngest son
in 1986.
   And to save more lives, Dr Kaunda
established the Ken Kaunda Central
Africa Foundation to help fight the
scourge.

of the foundation. I can say I was moti-
