the schools and not the students that are the problem, the
events of last weekend at the schools and colleges music

   At least five students were held by police at the festival
venue, Kenyatta International       Conference Centre, for being
in possession of alcohol.                                                                                                                                   ~W~I~~~lIA~                  mRf((NNP)

   That the students had the audacity to buy the alcohol from
some dens and ferry them to the KICC was a sad testimony
that we have seasoned and dare-devil drug peddlers in our
schools.                                                                                                                                                              ~~
