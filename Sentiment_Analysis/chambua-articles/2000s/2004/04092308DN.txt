This will be a marked depar-\r\nture from the past when the drugs were inaccessible even to\r\npatients with the wherewithal to procure them ..\r\n    The announcement        also comes at a time when the Govern-\r\nment is grappling with the logistics of formulating and rolling\r\nout a free national health insurance scheme. There is no\r\ndoubt that this development        will have far-reaching implica-\r\ntions for this scheme.\r\n    Ever since President Moi declared it a national disaster in\r\n1999, Aids has continued to eat into the country's heaithcare\r\nbudget. It impacts negatively on other sectors, like education,\r\nagriculture and business. Many employers have to spend large\r\nsums of money to take care of ailing employees and pay ter-\r\nminal benefits to those who exit due to the scourge.\r\n    When the drugs become available, the Government,\r\nemployers and even families will reduce their expenditures         on                                                   WHAT OTHERS SAY 0 CHARLES ONY ANGO-OBBO\r\ntaking care of those living with Aids.\r\n     It should not be lost on us, though, that, with the drugs\r\nbeing manufactured        locally, some street-smart fraudsters may                         Sorry, party for nude patrons only~\r\nstart producing counterfeit drugs and sell worthless concoc-\r\n tions in the name of ARVs.\r\n     It is a cinch that, with time, there will appear ARVs that do\r\n not contain the right ingredients required to treat the disease                                                                                                                              territory in Spain.
