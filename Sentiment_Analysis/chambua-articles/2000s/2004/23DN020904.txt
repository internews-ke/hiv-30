                    Â·ds vaccine fails crucial test
It is disappointment as product fails to produce adequate protection
                he Aids vaccine developed in Kenya has failed to offer
                 to be short-lived.
                 protection against HIV, says the team working on the
T                project.
                    The vaccine only offered immunity to an insignifi-
                 cant percentage of volunteers, and even this was found
                    The disappointing results of the six-year study were
released on Tuesday by all the participating partners at an Aids Vac-
cine 2004 conference in Lausanne, Switzerland. -
   Although initial data indicated that the vaccine is safe and well tol-
erated among the 205 volunteers from Kenya, Uganda and the United
Kingdom, "only a quarter of these indicated they had developed some
protection against the virus, but even these responses were not long
lasting."
   Studies in Kenya and Uganda showed immune response rates not
greater than 25 per cent among the combined 86 volunteers vacci-
nated since 2001, against a 60 per cent rate considered by some vac-
cine experts asjhe benchmark.
   The project's main funders, International Aids'Vaccjne Initiative,
in a statement, say it will now complete a small number of clinical
trials that have already started over the next six to nine months.
   "Unless we see some dramatic improvement in performance we
will not develop the candidates further, and will focus on our other
research and development projects," says the statement.
    In the two remaining studies, scientists at Kenya Aids Vaccine Initi-
ative and Oxford University are going to increase the dosage of the
vaccine and administer it through different routes among the remain-'
ing volunteers to see if there will be a boost in the immune-response.
    "What we want to do is to see if an increased dosage would directly
 result in the vaccine generating more immune responses. But if after
 that we fail to see much improvement, then IAVI will terminate the
testing of this vaccine and embark on its other vaccine projects," says
 Dr Crispin Kambili.
   The vaccine candidates, scientifically known as DNA.HIV A and
 MVA.HIV A are jointly owned by the Oxford University of Britain
 and University of Nairobi in Kenya. Their development cost more
 than one billion shillings.
    The 439 study volunteers, among them 106 in Kenyans, 50 in Ugan-
 dans, and 222 British, overwhelmingly participated in various phases
 of the study whose results established the vaccine's safety when used
 in human beings.
    The volunteers, who have been monitored for over a year after vac-
 cination while being subjected to extensive medical examinations,
 have not revealed any serious side effects.
    The vaccine becomes the second Aids vaccine candidate - which
 has reached human trials- to fail. Last year, AidsVax, developed by
 VaxOen of the US, also failed to give the desired results.
    This new development has other immediate implications. IAVI's
 planned trials in the Netherlands and Rwanda, based on the Kenya
 candidate, will not go on. Recruitment of volunteers in South Africa-
 Durban and Johannesburg, and Switzerland, has also been halted.
