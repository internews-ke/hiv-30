{"text": "\ufeffDaily Nation / Tuesday, August 24, 2004\r\n\r\nHealth experts\r\nWomen are now starting to have sex\r\nslightly later than before, the statistics\r\nshow: from 16.7 years in 1998 to\r\n17.8 years today. Health experts\r\nregard this as encouraging because\r\nthe younger the woman is when she\r\ninitiates sex, the more likely she is to\r\nbe infected with HIV.\r\nAnd there is more good news: with\r\nHIV/Aids in the spotlight comes the\r\ndisclosure that far fewer people are\r\nsuffering from the virus than previously\r\nfeared.\r\nCurrent estimates of HIV/Aids infection\r\nhave been almost halved, from\r\nabout 13 per cent to seven per cent.\r\nThe new estimate of seven per cent is\r\nmore reliable because for the first\r\ntime since the emergence of HIV/\r\nAids in Kenya, prevalence has been\r\ncalculated from actual blood samples\r\ntaken throughout the country,\r\ninstead of just blood taken from\r\nmothers attending ante-natal clinics\r\nat selected sites, then estimated\r\nnationally through mathematical formulae.\r\nSadly, the survey also shows that\r\nmore Kenyans are dying today than\r\nthey were a decade ago.\r\nThey are eating poorly and fewer\r\nchildren are being immunised, while\r\nfamilies are getting bigger all the\r\ntime.\r\nMortality is higher\r\nPrevious gains in critical areas like\r\nchild survival, family planning, and\r\nmothers' health are sliding back.\r\nThe survey reveals more adult deaths\r\nthan 10 years ago, with more women\r\ndying younger than men, but after\r\nthe age of 39 male mortality is higher.\r\nThe Kenya Demographic and lIealth\r\nSurvey will be launched today by\r\nPlanning minister Anyang' Nyong'o\r\nand his health counterpart, Mrs\r\nCharity Ngilu.\r\nThe last such survey was in 1998 and\r\nits main objective is to provide facts\r\nfor policy makers, planners and\r\nrescarchers.\r\nData was collected over five months\r\nperiod in 2003 from a national representative\r\nsample of 10,000 households.\r\nThe study was by the Central Bureau\r\nof Statistics with the Ministry of\r\nHealth, KEMRI, NASCOP and the\r\nNational Council for Population and\r\nDevelopment with external funding\r\nfrom several donors.\r\n\r\nTHE REPORT WILL BE LAUNCHED TODAY BY THE HEALTH MINISTER."}
