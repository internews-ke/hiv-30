                 Dangers posed by unsafe Injections
                OStof the 16 ~il/ion injections administered annually in
               blood-borne injections, leading to avoidable burdens on
  M            the developing world are both unnecessary and unsafe.
               They have been linked to the transmission of deadly
  ·health care systems, and death.
       Many cases of infection and deaths linked to unsafe injections
   have been documented. In the early 1960s, a campaign for
- paranteral treatment of schistosomiasis in Egypt resulted in the
   first documented large-scale outbreak of Hepatitis C.
       In 1976, an outbreak of Ebola (haemorrhagic fever virus) was
   linked to unsafe injections given at a hospital where the first
   patient had been treated with injections.
       Unsafe injections thus constitute a public health concern
   requiring urgent and appropriate preventive measures.
       The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a safe injection
   as one that does no harm to the recipient, does not expose the
   health workers to any risk, and does not result in waste that is
   dangerous for the community.
       To achieve this, the injection needs to be prepared in a clean
   area, using medication drawn from a sterile vial.
       The injection musfbe administered using a sterile syringe and
   needle. After administration, sharp equipment needs to be dis-
  carded in a puncture proof container for appropriate disposal.
   Any break or department for this procedure represents a risk ren-
   dering the injection unsafe.
   WHO estimates that un~afe injections maybe responsible for:           .
   • 8 to 16 million cases: of Hepatitis B (33 per cent of new Hepati- .
   tis Binfections annually)
  • 2 to 5 million cases of Hepatitis C
   • 80,000 to 160,000 cases of HIV/Aids
       Unsafe injections are a powerful engine to transmit blood
   borne pathogens (disease-causing micro-organisms). Because
