He never asked for any payment neither was he paid a cent over the period he\r\n     offered his free services to NYUMBANI COMPANY LTD.

Full\r\n     Mary Owens refused to go with the boards decision, Dr. Otsyula's parting from NYUMBANI COMPANY lTD\r\n     was due to his displeasure at the clandestine research on innocent children by OXFORD University and Fr.           documentation should be forwarded to:\r\n     D'Agostino of NYUMBANI COMPANY LTO and Illegal export of their blood to OXFORD University.
