{"text": "\ufeffDaily Nation/ Tuesday, August 31, 2004\r\nCape Town, South Africa\r\nThe high court in South Africa last week\r\ndismissed a challenge to the country's\r\nnew drug pricing regulations, which are\r\naimed at bringing down medicine prices\r\nin Africa's biggest drug market.\r\n\"The court has decided in favour of the\r\nMinister of Health,\" Debbie Peatman,\r\nchief legal director at the Department of\r\nHealth, told reporters.\r\nThe regulations will take effect immediately\r\nand will set a maximum of 26 percent\r\nfor the retail dispensing fee that\r\npharmacists may charge customers.\r\nPharmacists' groups said the move could\r\ndrive many of them out of business.\r\nThe regulations also set a so-called \"single\r\nexit price\" for drugs coming from\r\nmanufacturers, forbidding discounts and\r\nincentive programmes that have been\r\noffered in the past to retailers and pharmacies.\r\nSouth Africa's Pharmaceutical Society,\r\nalong with retailer New Clicks and private\r\nhealth care provider Netcare, had\r\nchallenged the new laws.\r\nA majority on the three-judge panel dismissed\r\nthe contention that the government\r\nhad acted unlawfully in considering\r\nrecommendations of the department\r\nof health's pricing committee, which it\r\nruled had acted fairly and within its\r\npowers ..\r\nLawyers for the applicants said they\r\nwould review the judgment and decide\r\nnext week whether to lodge an appeal.\r\nDrug prices are a particularly sensitive\r\nsubject in South Africa, which has the\r\nworld's highest caseload of HIV and\r\nAids with some five million people\r\ninfected.\r\nSouth Africa launched its drug pricing\r\nplan in April, saying the elimination of\r\nmanufacturer incentives and capping of\r\npharmacists' mark-ups would save consumers\r\nup to 3 billion rand ($450 million)\r\nper year.\r\nThe court challenge delayed the caps on\r\npharmacy fees, while the manufacturer\r\nincentive ban was implemented quickly.\r\nBoth are fully in force following Friday's\r\nruling, Health Ministry officials said.\r\nHumphrey Zokufa, the Department of\r\nHealth's director for pharmaceuticals,\r\nsaid the court's ruling\r\nwould open the G h II door to better ourt c a enge health care for mil- -----------\r\nlions of poor South delayed the cap on Africans. _\r\n\"This is not a vic- pharmacyfiees tory for the Department\r\nof Health. ----------\r\nThis is a victory for consumers. We\r\nknow what was done over the last couple\r\nof weeks. Consumers have been held\r\nransom by high prices.\"\r\nIvan Kotze, executive director of the\r\nPharmaceutical Society, said the fact\r\nthat the court failed to rule unanimously\r\nagainst the group's complaint showed\r\nthere were still questions about the new\r\npricing rules. \"We are disappointed, but\r\nthe split judgment shows there is merit\r\nin our case. We will have to study the\r\njudgment to determine what to do from\r\nhere. We still say the pharmacies will not\r\nbe able to operate their business, pay\r\ntheir salaries and pay their rents,\" he\r\nsaid. Zokufa rejected concerns from the\r\nPharmaceutical Society that it could take\r\na month to implement the regulations,\r\nsaying pharmacists should have prepared\r\nfor the ruling. \"It's negligence at\r\nbest,\" he said.\r\nBut pharmacists appeared shocked by\r\nFriday's judgment.\r\n\"I'm actually feeling quite sick, it's not\r\nonly affecting pharmacy owners, it's\r\naffecting the employee ... how will we\r\npay our rents,\" Cape Town pharmacist\r\nNatalie Geard said.\r\njEven as the court was\r\nmaking its ruling, Glaxo-\r\nSmithKline Pic had\r\ngranted a third voluntary\r\nlicence to a South African\r\ngenerics firm to market\r\nits anti-Aids medicines.\r\nThe firm is the world's\r\nleading supplier of HIV/Aids drugs.\r\nFeza Pharmaceuticals will be allowed to\r\nmanufacture, import and sell antiretrovirals\r\ncontaining GSK's two patented\r\nproducts zidovudine, also known\r\nas AZT, and lamivudine, the Britishbased\r\ncompany said in a statement.\r\nFeza will initially import the drugs, but\r\nthe firm hopes to start manufacturing\r\nthem locally once it has received the\r\nnecessary clearance from regulators.\r\n(Reuters)"}
