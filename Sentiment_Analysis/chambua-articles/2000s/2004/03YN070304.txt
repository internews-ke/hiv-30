Avoid too much alcohol, avoid
HI V/Aids

One of the things that catalyses the
spread of HIV/Aids among youngsters is
drunkenness. Many young men and
women expose themselves to HIV
infect3on when they socialise and drink
to the point of forgetting
k$e1ves Once drunk, many young
sterQxpo$e tbemselvesto unsafe sex
becase It beconies difficult for them to
say MNo to sex, use condoms or to prac
tise safe sexe So I urge all youths lo avoid
taking alcohol i they want to keep
HIV/AIDS away.
