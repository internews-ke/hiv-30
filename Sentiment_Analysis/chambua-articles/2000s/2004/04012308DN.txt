In its pursuit, service must suffer. An\r\nT       corrupt institutions. And corruption is not just greed\r\ninstitution which is supposed to prevent crime has eventually\r\nbecome the personification of crime.\r\n   So the question arises: How can Kenyans be asked to\r\nmaintain such an organisation? Do its members deserve a\r\npay rise, especially of the magnitude that the Government\r\nannounced on Wednesday?\r\n   Our answer, nevertheless, is yes, because the force is\r\nessential. Moreover, the rot can, in a sense, be traced to the\r\nextremely poor pay the police get.\r\n   A boost in cash earnings might go some way towards\r\ncleaning up the filth. There is only one scruple. Where\r\nbribery has become a dominant thought-habit, it may require\r\nmuch more than cash to put paid to it.\r\n   Indeed, in the long run, payment in kind might prove\r\ninfinitely more effective than cash, which, being inherently\r\ncorruptive, is not guaranteed to be spent on real needs. A\r\nbetter and subsidised house is a different story.\r\n   Why does a Government which is perennially\r\ncash-strapped and which - because of it - is perpetually at\r\nloggerheads with such other essential services as the teaching\r\nprofession - think that cash is the only way it can improve\r\nits employees' conditions?                                                                                                          DOUBLE LOSS 0 LUCY OR lANG'\r\n   Why does each service have a pay structure completely\r\nseparate from that of every other? We have only one public\r\nservice. So what we need is a single general emolument                                          Time to cut your losses,\"'\u00a5vonne\r\npolicy for it.\r\n   It is true that some services have special skills which\r\nrequire special rewards.
