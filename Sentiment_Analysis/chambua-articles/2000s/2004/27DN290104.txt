            Researchers have expressed hope that new approaches to developing
           a vaccine against Aids will eventually vanquish the killer virus and
           said the needed global network of trials was finally falling into place.

           Aids Vaccine Initiative.
              There are now so many different trials going on that the chances
           are good that scientists will find a vaccine that can actually work, says
           Dr Barton Haynes, a vaccine researcher at Duke University in North                                                                                                                                                    .'

              "It is safe to say we have reached the beachhead in the quest for an
           Aids vaccine," says Haynes. "There is renewed optimism in the field
           of vaccine development."
              The 1,000 researchers at the meeting compared notes on experi-
           mental vaccines that combine genetic material from the Aids virus
           with smallpox vaccines, polio vaccines and animal viruses, as well as
           vaccines that use genes alone.
              "Clearly we are still far from the
           development of a completely pro-
           tective and effective vaccine," Hay-
           nes said. But the pace of research
           has accelerated, even as the first
           vaccine to go through the full three
           phases of testing in people, Vax-
           Gen's AIDSV AX, failed to show
           earlier this year that it could protect
           against HIV.
               Private companies, government
           researchers and nonprofit vaccine
           advocacy organisations are moving
           ahead with the next generation of
           vaccines, said Dr Margaret John-
           ston of the National Institute of
           Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
           "The pipeline has expanded consid-
           erably based on what it was five
           years ago," she said.
              Dr Norman Letvin of Harvard
           Medical School in Boston said one                                                                                           For just
           promising area involved stimulating                                                                                                                                                                                   7

           invaders such as viruses and bacteria.                                                                                      5,490/-
              "There is a good deal of enthusiasm in the scientific community as
           well as in pharmaceutical companies to pursue these sort of strate-
           gies," he said. "There is also a renewed commitment to vaccines that
     _     will elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies."
              Antibodies are immune proteins that attach to invaders. Experts
           now believe that both T-cell and antibody responses are needed to
           fight HIV, which is more difficult to fight than most viruses because it
           infects immune system cells.

              Aids has killed 28 million people worldwide, most of them in Afri-
           ca, since the epidemic began in the 1980s. An estimated 5 million
           were infected in 2001 alone and 43 million have the fatal virus.
              Drug cocktails can keep HIV patients healthy but the vast majority
           of patients have no access to drugs and are doomed to die. All experts
           agree that a vaccine is the only hope for controlling Aids.
