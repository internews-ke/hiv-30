      fyou have ever bought a jar of
   I Vaseline and wondered why it had
     a strange colour, and even stranger
     smell, or a packet of Homecup Chai
 that produced a miserable brew of
 weak, flavourless tea, then you are
 most likely a victim of the wily ways of
 counterfeiters.
    Consumer fraud is big business in
 Kenya. In some cases,the appearance
 and performance of the fake products
 may be so close to the real thing that
 you would never suspect you had been
 duped. Forewarned is forearmed, so
 read about the operations of copycat
manufacturers in our main story this
week, how they dupe consumers, and
the economic impact of their illegal
operations.
    Have you ever wondered why it is
that women are rarely, if ever, sent to
the battlefront, or why men are more
prone to violence than women? Join
0yunga Pala as he explores the
interesting theory that the potential for
aggression is biological, rather than
cultural. Who knows, it might help
shed some light on why Kenya has
more than its fair share of wife-
beaters.
    Our fiction piece could easily fit into
Jeffery Archer's short story collection,
A Twist in the Tale,and makes
compelling reading. This, plus an
exciting menu of entertainment stories,
puzzles and feature stories should help
usher in your weekend in style. Have a
peaceful one.
