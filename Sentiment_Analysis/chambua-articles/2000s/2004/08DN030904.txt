          cal breakthrough. Yet it did not take long before the
W         the "Nyayo Car" was touted as Kenya's technologi-
veil was removed and the charade exposed for what it was.
   The thing then died a slow and natural death and little or
nothing has been heard about the Nyayo Pioneer Car and the
company that was behind it - Numerical Machines Com-
plex.
   But, if we put aside the showmanship and gave serious
thought to Numerical Machines Complex, we might be sur-
prised at the amount of resources - technological as well as
in terms of ideas - we allow to lie fallow or go to waste.
   Arguably, the complex has the best equipment in this part
of the world. If put to good use, it would achieve amazing
results. The plant can be used to manufacture     motor vehicles
and even train spare parts
   It can earn us and huge incomes and save the country the
foreign exchange we pour into importing spares of all kinds.
   At any rate, the complex was put up with public funds.
They need to be recouped. Indeed, the complex is a sad testi-
mony to the folly of setting up business enterprises purely to
satisfy a leader's ego or to score some political goals.
   This is why we join Planning Minister Peter Anyang'-
Nyong'o in asking the Government      to revive the complex
and, this time purely for the business and make money for                                                                        HONOURING THE DEAD 0 LUCY OR lANG'
