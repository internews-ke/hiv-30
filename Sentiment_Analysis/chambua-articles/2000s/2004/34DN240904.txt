     EXCITING CHALLENGE
     CONTRIBUTING TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE TO THE
      Our client, the National Aids Control Council (NACC) was established in November 1999 and mandated to:
      • Provide policy and a strategic framework
      • Mobilise and coordinate resources for national response
      • Facilitate stakeholders to' prevent the spread of HIV transmission and to provide care and support for those infected and affected.
      In view of the above NACC has a mission to provide policy and a strategic framework for mobilizing and co-ordinating resources, for prevention of HIV transmission and provision of care and
      support to the infected and affected people in Kenya by embracing a multi sectoral appr<;>ach.
      Within the last three and a half years NACC has developed an institutional framework and is now undergoing restructuring following recommendations from the National Aids Control Council,
      Joint Institutional Review (NJIR) report. The proposed structure seeks to reposition NACC to fulfil its mandate as the facilitator of stakeholders in the effective implementation of the national
      response to the HIV/Aids pandemic. It will do so by providing a framework, including support and coordination, for stakeholders to participate effectively and generate appropriate pOlicies and a
      national strategy, develop a financing and advocacy strategy, amongst others and to serve as an effective facilitator and Secretariat for the national response to HIV/Aids in Kenya.
      To realise this exceptionally comprehensive and broad initiative, it was recommended that three (3) departments be established to implement NACC's mandate, namely the Policy, Strategy and
      Communication Department, the Coordination and Support Department and the Finance and Administration Department. A core team of highly qualified specialists will staff these departments.
      In this initial recruitment campaign, NACC seeks to identify suitable individuals to fill three deputy director level positions and eight division heads positions for the three departments. These
      positions include a Deputy Director, Policy, Strategy and Communication; Deputy Director, Coordination and Support; Deputy Director, Finance and Administration; Head, Strategy Development;
      Head, Policy Research and Monitoring and Evaluation; Head, Communication; Head, Technical Support; Head, Stakeholder Coordination Section; Head, Human Resource and Administration;
      Finance Manager and a Head of Management Information Systems (MIS).
