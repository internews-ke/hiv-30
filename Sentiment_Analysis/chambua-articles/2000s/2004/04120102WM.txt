{"text": "Daily Nation/ December 1, 2004\r\n\r\nWHAT BECAME OF THE AIDS BILL?\r\n\r\nNO ONE SEEM INTERESTED IN PUSHING IT ANY FURTHER AND ITS IN DANGER OF DYING\r\n\r\nCONTINUED FROM PAGE 1\r\naddress legal matters concerning HIV/Aids with\r\nother workers and people living with the scourge,\r\nregard to marriage, research, insurance and drug\r\naccess matters and make recommendations.\r\nThe Task Force also reviewed offences under the\r\nPenal Code and other offences in the'laws of Kenya\r\nin light of the HIV/Aids pandemic and made rec-\r\n\r\nommendations on how the penal laws could be\r\nstrengthened.\r\nOn August 6, 2004, the Bill was gazetted. And\r\nthat was the last we heard of it. No one seems\r\ninterested in pushing it any further and it now\r\nappears to be in danger of dying. \"When a bill is\r\ntabled in Parliament, it follows a calendar. If the\r\nperson under whose jurisdiction a bill falls does not\r\n\r\n\r\npush for it, that bill might never see the light of\r\nday,\" says an official in the AG's chambers. In the\r\ncase of the mY/Aids Hill, the mandate to push it\r\nFellunder the Ministry of Health.\r\n\r\nSafe practices\r\n\r\nThe Bill addresses many issues that are important\r\nto the survival and rights of people living with HIV/\r\n\r\nAids (PLWHA) as well as those not infected. Some\r\n\r\nof these issues include ensuring safe practices - for\r\n\r\ninstance, someone offering to donate any tissue will\r\n\r\nundergo HIV testing, while any blood donated\r\n\r\nmust be tested for the virus. Also included are\r\n\r\nguidelines to be followed in medical institutions to\r\nensure no infections occur in the line of duty.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important parts of the Bill\r\nand which has become contentious among\r\nmany interested parties is Part IV 13(1,2),\r\nwhich deals with testing, screening and access\r\nto healthcare services. \"No person shall com-\r\npel another to undergo an liIV test as a pre-\r\ncondition to or continued enjoyment of\r\nemployment, marriage, admission into 'any\r\neducational institution, entry into or travel out\r\nof the country or provision of healthcare, insur-\r\nance cover or any other service.\" Section 14(1)\r\nsubject to sub-section (2) of 13 says a child will not\r\nundergo a test unless a guardian or parent allows it.\r\nAnother contentious section says that the results\r\nof an HIV test will remain confidential except in\r\ncases of a child or one with a disability that renders\r\nthem incapable of understanding the results.\r\n\r\nAvailable resources\r\nSection (2) mandates the Government to the maxi-\r\n\r\n\r\nmum of its available resources to take the steps,\r\nnecessary to ensure access to essential,\r\n\r\nto essential services, including access to\r\nhealth care medicines at affordable\r\n\r\nprices by persons with HIV or.\r\n\r\nAids and those exposed to the\r\n\r\nrisk (such as rape victims).\r\n\r\nSection 20 emphasises the\r\n\r\nconfidentiality of one taking a\r\n\r\ntest - using codes for the I\r\n\r\nwhole process and ensuring no\r\n\r\ntransmission of this informa-\r\n\r\ntion to any other person other\r\n\r\nthan the tested person or the\r\nother people mentioned. Part\r\n\r\nIV has become a very con-\r\n\r\ntentious one with PLWHA's.\r\nIt states that a person who is\r\n\r\naware of his HIV-positive\r\nI\r\nstatus and knowingly\r\nf,\r\ninfects others will be pros-\r\n\r\necuted.                        i\r\n\r\nPart VIII discusses dis-\r\n\r\ncriminatory acts and poli-\r\n\r\ncies that include insurance\r\n\r\ncovers. An insurance\r\norganisation should devise\r\na reasonable limit of cover An artist with flames \r\nburning on his hat show how Aids consumes people like ,fir\r\nfor which a proposer shall not be required to dis-\r\nclose his or her HIV status but if one exceeds that\r\nlimit, they will be compelled to a HIV test.\r\n\r\nNo person shall undertake HIV or Aids-related\r\nbiomedical research on another person or on any\r\ntissue or blood removed from such person unless\r\nsuch a research conforms to the requirements\r\nunder the Science and Technology Act or any other\r\nwritten law for the ti e in force.\r\nSo why has the Bi not gone anywhere? \"Very\r\nmany factors and for s that do not want to see it\r\ngo through for their own selfish reasons,\" says\r\nAmollo, a joint secretary of the Task Force.\r\nWhile the Bill is supposed to accommodate many\r\nbeen accused of playing a role in inciting PLWHA 's\r\nfactors surrounding people with HIV, including\r\nresearch rights, some foreign organisations have\r\n\r\nfor their own gains. According to Amollo, \"Unless\r\nthe Bill is tabled in Parliament soon, it might die.\"\r\nHe expresses concern about the foreign organisa-\r\ntions. \"All organisations that work with PLWHA\r\n\r\ncontributed to the Task Force. But they did not\r\nraise the issues they are raising now. Who are the\r\nsufferers at the end of the day? People with HIV/\r\n\r\nAids, not those who are HIV-negative.\"\r\nAmollo also feels that it will be important for\r\namendments to be made to the Bill after it is passed\r\nso it can address prisoners' problems, Aids orphans\r\nand the Succession Act, and traditional practices\r\n\r\nthat hinder the fight against HIV/Aids.\r\nMuma also sees insurance companies playing a\r\n\r\nrole in blocking the Bill. \"Insurance companies all\r\n\r\nover the world and some right here in Kenya are\r\n\r\nadjusting to the fact that the scourge is affecting\r\n\r\nmillions of their potential customers. They know\r\n\r\nthat there is no way they will survive if they do not\r\n\r\ninsure people with HIV. Th~ issue of insurance also\r\naffects mortgages and the like. Who says that peo-\r\n\r\nple with HIV cannot payoff their loans?\" she says.\r\n\r\nLife insurance\r\nLast May, the Association of Kenya Insurers (AKI)\r\nthreatened that life insurance premiums would\r\nincrease if the proposed Bill went through. The\r\nAKI executive director was quoted saying, \"The\r\nAssociation strongly submits that if these legislative\r\nchanges are adopted, insurance will be rendered\r\ninaccessible to the majority of Kenyans, whilst deal-\r\ning a major blow to the goal of mobilising long-\r\nterm savings through life insurance.\"\r\nDr Sobbie Mulindi, a lecturer at the University of\r\nNairobi who has been involved with HIV/Aids\r\nwork in Kenya for a long time, says that the issue of\r\nthe 2001 Abuja Declaration, where heads of states\r\nsigned a pact saying that the health budgets of their\r\nrespective countries must not be less than 15 per\r\ncent of the total budgets, has been a bone of con-\r\n\r\ntention for many countries. Kenya was a signa-\r\n\r\n\r\ntory to the declaration. \"Adhering to\r\nthis declaration means that HIV/\r\n\r\nAids issues are catered for and\r\n\r\nmust be taken seriously,\" he says.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArbitrary studies\r\n\r\nDr Mulindi also regards the\r\n\r\ncontentious research part of\r\n\r\nthe Bill as \"control and manip-\r\n\r\nulation\" global process by\r\n\r\ndonor countries.       \"These\r\n\r\norganisations know that if this\r\n\r\nBill goes through, they won't\r\n\r\nbe able to carry out arbitrary\r\nstudies on Kenyans like they\r\n\r\nare doing now.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe writer is a Harvard\r\n\r\nUniversity     Millennium\r\n\r\nHuman      Rights Fellow\r\n\r\nresearching on employ-\r\n\r\nment discrimination      of\r\n\r\npeople with J-/IV/Aids at\r\n\r\nthe Kenya       Human\r\n\r\nRights Commission."}
