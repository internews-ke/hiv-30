 Ross, who had come to see me in my office after
 her discharge from the hospital a week earlier. She
 had been admitted with inflammation of the gall
 bladder caused by gall stones.
      On admission she had cOJJ1plained pain in the
                                             of
 right upper abdomen, which went into her right
 shoulder - typical of gall bladder pain. She had
 vomited a couple of times and had given a past his-
 tory of flatulence after a fatty meal. "I need to
 loosen my corset if I eat fatty food," she had said.
      Writing the story of Mrs Ross takes me back
 almost 25 years. It was when medical students from
 Kenyatta National Hospital used to come to Aga
 Khan Hospital to attend bedside tutorials. At the
 time I used to share a surgical unit with the late
 Prof Awori at the teaching hospital. When he offici-
 ated as the professor of surgery, it was agreed'                                        " r~
