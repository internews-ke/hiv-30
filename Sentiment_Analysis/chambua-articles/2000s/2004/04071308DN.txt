All of these have served\r\n  to ingrain it in the public's mind that some people in the\r\n  Government were intent on abetting graft.\r\n     Even so, the latest drama - starring Finance minister\r\n  David Mwiraria and the youthful Government           spokesman\r\n  Alfred Mutua - pushes the scandal to ridiculous levels.\r\n     Dr Mutua is certainly a rookie in terms of Government\r\n  business and has the disadvantage of working in an office\r\n  that has never existed, which means there is no institutional\r\n  memory to bank on.\r\n     lt is he who last week triggered the latest round of\r\n  melodrama when he announced that the unidentified\r\n  business operatives behind Anglo Leasing had paid back to\r\n  the Treasury some Sh4.5 billion, which he later scaled down\r\n  to Sh461 million.\r\n     But no sooner had he said so than minister Mwiraria took\r\n  to the podium to trash that information. He said the\r\n  Government      had received only Sh91 million from Anglo                                                                  OUR HISTORICAL HERITAGE 0 ZARINA PATEL\r\n  Leasing. Of course, the fellows behind all the refunds -\r\n. whoever they are, whatever the sum - remained unknown.\r\n     All these things raise serious questions. The first is: Does                               Uhuru: Asians played crucial role\r\n  Dr Mutua know something that Mr Mwiraria does not?\r\n  Whom should we believe? Why should two members of the\r\n  same Government speak different language on a subject that                                                                                                                                                                                         r\r\n  should be clear-cut?
