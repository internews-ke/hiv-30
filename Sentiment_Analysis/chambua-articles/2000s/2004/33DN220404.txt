          Dolly scientists want to
          clone human embryos
                                  LONDON Wednesday
         The creators of Dolly the sheep, the world's first mammal cloned
         from an adult, want to create cloned human embryos for stem cell
         research.
         The Roslin Institute, near Edinburgh, Scotland, said it is considering
         applying to the government's fertility autho~ity for a license to carry
         out the procedure, known as therapeutic cloning.
         Ian Wilmut, who led the team which created Dolly, said it would be
         immoral; not to use therapeutic cloning for stem cell research, which
         many scientists believe could help treat disorders such as motor neu-
         rone disease, Parkinson's and diabetes.
         Therapeutic cloning involves removing the nucleus of a human egg
         cell and replacing it with the nucleus from a patient's body cell, such
         as a skin cell. The egg is then artificially stimulated, causing the egg .
         to develop in a way similar to an embryo fertilized by sperm.
         Scientists envision extracting stem cells - which have the potential
         to turn into every type of cell in the human body - from the Cloned
         embryo so that they would be a perfect transplant match for the
         patient.
         "This will create totally new opportunities to begin to understand
         disease. To begin to test new drugs and to research disease in totally
         new ways," Wilmut told SBC ..                                   _._
         A South Korean-led team reporred iil February the world's first suc-
       , cessful cloning of a human embryo and the culling of stem cells from
         it. Britain legalized therapeutic cloning in 2001, becoming the first
         country in the world to do so. The move allowed scientists to create
         cloned embryos only for purposes of extracting stem cells for medi-
         cal research. The extraction, which is done when the embryo is a few
         days old, means the clones cannot develop into ~abies.
