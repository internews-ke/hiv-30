 This is in reference to the advertisement placed in the newspapers (EA Standard 26/5/04 and Nation 27/5/04).
 Although J never intended to reply and never reply to such things, the article has made adverse mention of me and
 perpetrated falsehoods about me w.hich I want to correct. NYUMBANI used donor funds to malign me and avoided
 answering serious aUegationscontained in the Nation on 23/5/04 and 24/5/04.

      under the Companies Act (Cap 486) as a LIMITED COMPANY in 1996. What Sr. Mary, Owens and Paula
      Lanco from NYUMBANI COMPANY LTO board did not teU the pUblic is who the owners of this NYUMBANI                                   Medicine and Surgery
      COMPANY LTO are. The public deserves to know because they contribute money to NYUMBANI COMPANY.
 3) ETHICAL APPROVAL to. 'conduct research is normaUy granted by Th~ National Council, of Science and                   The Aga Khan University - Aga Khan Health Service, East Africa, in keeping with their
    'Technology (NCST) to ·researchers in government approved research organizations. In 2001, Dr. Otsyula
     applied to the NCST to grant him ethical approval to conduct' research at the Institute of Primate Research (a     mission of establishing high standards of medical education in developing countries,
     government approved institute)" Dr. Otsyula did not apply for the, approval with researchers from OXFORD           invites motivated. and talented individuals to apply for full time and part time faculty
     University or a Fr. Angelo 0' Agostino fr9m NYUMBANI COMPANY LTD, The approval was granted to Dr.
      Otsyula through the Institute of Primate Research on January 8, 2001 and'was signed by NCST Chairman Dr.          positions based at the Aga Khan Hospital, Nairobi. The Post Graduate Medical
      M. S. AbduUah, This is a FACT that can be verified from the National Ethics Chairman Dr. M. S. AbduUah.           Education programs in Medicine and Surgery will commence in 2004.
      NYUMBANI COMPANY LTD is not licensed to do research in Kenya and have no business entering into
      research MOU's with O~fORD UniYer~ity.
 4) Without taking necessary steps to get"approvai from the government of t.he republic of Kenya, OXFORD                Faculty will provide clinical leadership in their area of expertise, promote scholarship
    University researcher Sarah Rowland-Jones', and her·students Rana Chakraborty, Jedidah Dixon, Alex Cross            and research, develop the residents and participate in departmental activities.
    and others and Fr.Angelo 0' Agostino from NYUMBANICOMPANY lTD went ahead to conduct research on
    the innocent .AIDS virus infected Kenyan children under the custody of NYUMBANI COMPANY LTO and
    iIIegaUyexported their blood to OXFORD University. Not only did they violate the Helsinki protocol, they also       Applicants should hold an M.Med or equivalent degree in the specialty, with
    broke Kenya government law and violated innocent children's rights. This is a serious matter and not just "an
    oversight" as Sr. Mary 'Owens and Paula Lanco from NYUMBANI COMPANY lTD would like the public to                    appropriate clinical and educational experience. Successful candidates will be appointed
    believe.                                                                                                            to academiC 'ranks in keeping with their clinical and educational experience and the
 5) The aUegations that Dr, Otsyula has served as an employee of the NYUMBANI COMPANY LTO and was                       University's appointment guidelines. Compensation will be in line with clinical and
     terminated due to conflict of interest is an outright falsehood. The FACTS are that Dr. Otsyula volunteered to     academic involvement ..
     help the home ,free of charge. He never asked for any payment neither was he paid a cent over the period he
     offered his free services to NYUMBANI COMPANY LTD. But when he discovered that NYUMBANI COMPANY
     LTO was illegally exporting children's blood to Oxford, he complained to the Board Chairman Amb.· Denis            Interested candidates should apply in writing with attached curriculum vitae, addresses
   . Afande. The NYUMBANI COMPANY'S board of Directors then recommended that the exported blood samples
     be returnlld to Kenya immediately (minutes of the board meeting are available), Fr' Angelo D'Agostino and Sr.      of three referees and copies of a current medical license and medical certificates. Full
     Mary Owens refused to go with the boards decision, Dr. Otsyula's parting from NYUMBANI COMPANY lTD
     was due to his displeasure at the clandestine research on innocent children by OXFORD University and Fr.           documentation should be forwarded to:
     D'Agostino of NYUMBANI COMPANY LTO and Illegal export of their blood to OXFORD University. Dr. Otsyula
     subsequently reported the illegal ongoings at NYUMBANI COMPANY LTO to the Ministry of Health in 2001,
                                                                                                                        Manager, Human Resources,
 6)   Prof. Sam Ongeri the then Minister of Health ordered an investigation into NYUMBANI COMPANY. I believe            The Aga Khan Hospital, Nairobi
      the Investigations f.indingswere last year given to Amb Francis Muthaura the Permanent Secretary in the office
      of the President by the then Qirector of Medical Services Dr Richard Muga.                                        Third P~rklands Avenue
 7) Dr. Otsyula has never eng'aged in any slander against NYUMBANI. Whenever' he has raised concerns,                   Executive Office
    particularly about the secret research activities of NYUMBANI, COMPANY LTD. They have been weU                      P.O. Box 30270, GPO, NAIROBI
    intentioned, properly motivated and in good faith. It has never been Dr. Otsyula's intention to engage in any       KENYA
    malice against works of charity, but he champions pure and honest charity works.
 8) Dr. Otsyula would like to thank Dr M. S. AbduUah, Dr. R. Muga, Prof. I. Meme and Prof. Sam Ongeri who
      listened to and investigated his complaints concerning NYUMBANI COMPANY LTD, Dr. Otsyula also would               Closing date of application is June 30, 2004. An open forum to highlight the programs
