passion.
    And the evidence from all over the country shows that, in
less than two years, prisoners have gained more human rights
than they imagined. They eat better food, are better clothed,
are allowed intimacy with their spouses, read newspapers,
and so on.
    That is why Mr Moody Awori - the ebullient Vice-
President - and Mr Abraham Kamakil are to be congratu-
lated. By their efforts, they show awareness of the fact that
whenever you use punishment to destroy the human spirit or
body, you have also destroyed all possibility of rehabilitation.
     But what happened in the Meru prison the other day
showed that we have only just begun on the road to prison
reforms. The problem lies, we think, in the fact that all the
measures so far taken have been administrative.
     It should be self-evident that no reform is possible, in any
human institution if it is not directed, first and foremost, to

flea-hop in our reform efforts until there is an attitudinal                                                                        FAMILYMATTERS                   0 LUCY OR lANG'
