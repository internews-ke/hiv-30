                     factured by Ranbaxy Laboratories of India, several
                     organisations and individuals who had stocked them
                     say they have no alternative, and will continue using
                     them.
    NGOs and individuals who already have several doses of the drug -
Triviral, which is a combination of -Satavudine, Nevirapine and
Lamivudine- say the situation is desperate in certain areas because
there are no substitutes ..
    James Njuguna, who, with his wife are both HIV positive, says he
 had bought sufficient drugs to last them for three months, and do not
 have extra money to change the regimen.
-We        buy enough when we have money, and use the intervening
eriod before they get finished to raise mone.y for more doses. For
       .we have no option but to continue using them since we do not
        to interrupt our treatment."
    At Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF)-Belgium, which is offering free
 ARVs at Mbagathi District Hospital, Dr Delphine Sculier says they
 will continue giving the drugs to children, since they have no other
 alternative.
    Only for adults are they going to change to Triomune, a fixed dose
 combination manufactured by Cipla pharmaceuticals.
    Lamivudine and Stavudine, some of the drugs that together with
 Nevirapine make up Triomune, were in May removed from WHO's
 pre-qualification list after, like in Ranbaxy case, the Contract
 Research Organization (CRO) where Cipla did the bio-equivalence
 studies found them to be non-compliant with good clinical and labo-
 ratory practices.
    Bio-equivalence studies indicate the absorbability of the drug into
                                          the bloodstream, and the higher
