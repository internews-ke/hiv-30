Almost every day ever\r\nminister and the commissioner of prisons spoken of it with\r\npassion.\r\n    And the evidence from all over the country shows that, in\r\nless than two years, prisoners have gained more human rights\r\nthan they imagined. They eat better food, are better clothed,\r\nare allowed intimacy with their spouses, read newspapers,\r\nand so on.\r\n    That is why Mr Moody Awori - the ebullient Vice-\r\nPresident - and Mr Abraham Kamakil are to be congratu-\r\nlated. By their efforts, they show awareness of the fact that\r\nwhenever you use punishment to destroy the human spirit or\r\nbody, you have also destroyed all possibility of rehabilitation.\r\n     But what happened in the Meru prison the other day\r\nshowed that we have only just begun on the road to prison\r\nreforms. The problem lies, we think, in the fact that all the\r\nmeasures so far taken have been administrative.\r\n     It should be self-evident that no reform is possible, in any\r\nhuman institution if it is not directed, first and foremost, to\r\nthe mind. The point is that we are not likely to move even a\r\nflea-hop in our reform efforts until there is an attitudinal                                                                        FAMILYMATTERS                   0 LUCY OR lANG'\r\n transformation    in the thinking of those who handle prisoners.\r\n     We inherited from the colonial regime an arrest-and-\r\n confinement system in which an officer of the law - a police-                                  Get men to carry the burden, too\r\n man or a prison warder - does not feel \"professionally\"       ful-\r\n filled unless he is brutalising somebody. Obviously, sadism\r\n and bloodshed remain an officer's idea of his job-description.                                                                                                                                 custody or a presence in the lives of the chil-\r\n     But you cannot blame the officers in isolation.
