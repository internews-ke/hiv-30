{"text": "\ufeffDaily Nation/ Friday, April 9, 2004\r\nFeeble story\r\nlines taint\r\nfestival finals\r\n\r\n\r\nBY ANTHONY NJAGI\r\nThe plays that have so far beeri presented at finals of the\r\nNational Schools and Colleges Drama Festival at Lenana\r\nSchool in Nairobi reveal an appalling lack of artistic quality,\r\nespecially with regard to script writing. Even those\r\nthat rate highly with regard to acting and directing still\r\nfall far short of expectations in terms of story lines.\r\nSo far, only.Dilapidations ,by State House Girls and A New School.\r\nof Thought by St')bseph's Rapogi froni Nyanza have shown fairly'\r\nclear story lines, In ooth cases, it is at least possible to tell what the\r\nstory is about: .\r\nBut most other plays have many problems with regard to\"character_\r\nand character development. It is even difficult to discuss the characters\r\nbecause they either do not develop or the writers gi.ve only one:\r\nside of them .. '\r\nWhen such writers are unsure of what more to do with the characters\r\nany further, they resort to having a crowd oil stage. But even in'\r\nthese crowds, it is difficult to isolate and follow anyone character\r\nclearly because they are only brought in for a minute to either shout\r\nor cry. Schools that have fallen into this trap include Koyonzo Sec- _\r\nondary School, Mary Hill Girls' School, St Paul's Seminary and even\r\nMavoko Secondary School.\r\nPoor symbolism\r\nript writers would do well to pay close attention to details of charac~\r\nterisation to give depth to their plays, but also to make them meaningful,\r\nas it is through the characters that the author's intention is\r\ncommunicated. '\r\nThere were also notable problems with symbolism and imagery,\r\nwhich any good writer needs to use carefully to ensure effective com~\r\nmunication.\r\nA case in point were the ambiguous images in the play by Kamwenja\r\nTea<;hers' College, which\r\nleft the audience wondering what\r\nmessage the writer' intended to\r\ncommunicate. For example, what\r\ndid the daughter symbolise after\r\nthe writer had established that the\r\nmother symbolised Kenya? What\r\nabout the crowds? Who do they\r\nrepresent, given that they act uniformly?\r\nBesides, there were two\r\n- husbands, but it was not clear\r\nwhat they represented.\r\nAnother institution whose play\r\nhad unclear symbols was Moi High School Kabarak. The symbol of\r\nthe castle, for example, remains superfluous.\r\nThings were a bit' better in the dance category, with Kalara by\r\nMukumu Girls' High School, worthy of mention.\r\nKalara is the story a young woman by the same .name, who is\r\n_ living with Aids. As the dance opens Kalara is in distress. Her hus- -\r\nband has just \u00b7sdied of Aids-related causes, and she is a stigmatised\r\nwoman. The villagers will neither buy her goods at the market norallow\r\nher to\u00b7 draw water from the village well. She turns to the\r\nchurch, which also rejects her.\r\nIn despair, Kalara attempts suicide but is saved by a good Samaritan.\r\nShe also _attempts to murder her children to save them from'\r\nstigmatisation, but falls. Finally, she goes to a vcr centre, where she\r\ngets counselling.\r\nt Effective message l The vcr worker also talks to community members, who agree to\r\n!. '~'ptK,J\", b,cr. f Choreographed by Musambayi Samba and Yakhama Mike, the\r\nI.. dance effectively conveys the intended message. However, there are\r\n~ome scenes where overcrowding is evident on stage, which inte,r-\r\n~ feres with the movement of the performers.\r\nAlso marring the presentation were the dancers' gaudy biker's\r\nshorts. The producer should invest more in costumes in future as the\r\nshorts were rather unsightly. -\r\nThen there was the implausible manner in.which the conflict was\r\nresolved. When Kalara is reintegrated into society, she opens a vcr\r\ncentre. Yet she was a small-time trader.\r\nKalara is a poor jobless woman, and having her open a kiosk\r\nwould have been more believable. Among the outstanding dancers_\r\nwere Beatrice Riziki, who acts as'the'depressed Kalara; Joy Lodeni\r\nand Ethel Palapala, acting as teacher and pastor respectively; Vera\r\nAtsango and MitchelleLyambila, who play the doctors; and Cynthia\r\nMuka and BeFyl Wangkal as the children.\r\nThe story-line of Kalara is simple to follow and quite interesting.\r\nThe events unfold chronologically and tl1eplot is easy to follow. The\r\ntheme is also topical: el).couraging pepple to stop discriminating\r\nagainst those living with HIV and Aids and'to go for voluntary tests."}
