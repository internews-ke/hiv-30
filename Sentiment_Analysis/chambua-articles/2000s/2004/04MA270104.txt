STRAIGHT TALK JANUARY 30, 2004

TRUST NOBODY

The bereaved now believe,it's no joke
Youths are warned, they stili call it a
mock
Only when it's late. too late to wake
Do they realize. mistakes they have
made?
Trustnobody, Including yourself
AIDS Is an Incurable and mysterious dls·
ease
You have heard of It, you have no
excuse
It consumes your flesh leaving you
'meatless'
Trust nobody, Including yourself
IV Straight Talk. January 30. 2004.
The world mourns, who to conquer It
Doctors strlve,ln vain to vanquish If
Decisions are personal, there Is no coerslon
Do not expect miracles, AIDS Is real
Trust nobody, Including yourself
Trust nobody
laking advantage'
Healthy they shine, thinking It Is rosy
Momentarily they are kept for three to fif·
teen years
Only to ascertain their status, some resort
to suicide
Overcome Intimidation and be optimistic
Trust nobody, Including yourself
Having a partner? Trust nobody
Seeking drugs? Trustnobody
Using TRUST?Trustnobody
Refrain from sex, It Is the best solution.
