I am looking for a place whee I can buy sex toys.
They are the best thing to have in this era of HIV
Aids. Do you know where I can buy them ni Ken
ya? Or can I be allowed to import them’? If these
things were openly obtainable, they would help to
combat HW!Aids, rapes etc.

How are the toys likely to help combat rapes? You
seem to think that rape is all about sex. Rape is
about power. You sound so knowledgable about
the capabilities of these toys that I am surprised
you do not where or how to get them,
YOU’RE A HOME WRECKER
Your manners of solving problems is very weird. I
refer to “I Cant Let Go of This Drunk” (Septem
ben). How do you advise someone to divorce her
husband because he is a drunkard. The problem the
man is undergoing can be resolved. Instead of
advising the lady to help her husband get out of his
problem. you advise her to leave him. You are like
those FIDA women who break homes. Everybody
has a weakness and they need just a little help. Do
you want to tell me that the next time someone tells
you that hisiher spouse is HIV -positive you will
advise them to run away? Please quit that job
before you lead us asnay.

What problem is the man undergoing and what is
his weakness? Life dictates that that a drunkard be
avoided at all costs because drunkenness is not a
disease. It is sheer irresponsibility, to put it plainly.
A perpetually drunk man rs already a nome
breaker. and HlYìAids is a condition and the per
son living with H1Y’Aids needs care. but a drunk
ard just wants more alcohol. Get it?
