Waki: It was justice on trial
       nnocentpeople have been jailed for life or even hanged,
    part of a judge is, of course, on the cards. But our courts
I   and scoundrels have gone scot free. Hanky panky on the
and judicial commissions depend for their rulings almost
entirely on evidence.
    Granted, evidence itself may be lent dazzling colour by the
lawyer's investigative skill and courtroom delivery. Criminal
lawyer Byron Georgiadis's.spate of courtroom victories were
enhanced by his ability to package his cases and his gift of
the gab.
   But no matter. That is the nature of our judicial system. It
is the reason we must celebrate the fact that - in keeping
with that postulate of justice we call the rule of law - a
judicial commission has found Mr Justice Philip Waki
innocent of all charges of judicial corruption. It is a victory
for the system.
   But it is also a victory for the man, who was so ruthlessly
hounded out of office on charges of corruption. Sadly,
though, his victory is likely to be marred by the cynicism with
which we judge our justice procedures.
   What this simply means is that Mr Justice Waki - or any
other "big man" - still has another battle to fight, this time
in the court of public opinion which, frighteningly, is shaped
by perceptions.                                                                                                                  CO-OP MOVEMENT 0 JOSEPH GICHURU
