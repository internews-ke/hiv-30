    national Aids Vaccine Initiative and .oxford University- are about,
    for the first time, to decode their first series of trials and analyse the
    results for the Kenya and .oxford studies later this year.
       The findings of the critical phase that is testing the ability of the
    vaccine to elicit immune responses are expected to give an authorita-
    tive pointer as to whether or not the scientists will go back to the
    drawing board to improve the current vaccine being tested, or accel-

      The concept behind the vaccine development         is based on the
   immune responses of prostitutes in Majengo to the HIY virus. These
   women, though continually exposed to the virus through unprotected
   sex, never got infected.
       Researchers who followed them c1osely.later discovered they had
   specific natural killer T-cells which destroyed the HIV virus, making
   them remain negative.
