TOUGH CHOICES FOR KENYANS WITH HIV AND AIDS

BY RICHARD DELATE

Asunta Wagura, Executive Director of the
Kenya Network of
Women with Aids, is
an angry women as
she points to several
photographs in front of her.
Each photo tells a different story,
of how, according to her, the
Kenyan health care system is
·.~.iling to su~port pe~ple living
~wlth HIV/Alds, despIte the gov-
/ ernment declaring Aids an emergency
and a priority.
In one photograph, two children
JO older than 14 years of age sit
on a couch next to their mother,
their eyes shining and bright.
Last Wednesday their mother
died of diarrhoea, an opportunistic
infection associated with HIV/
Aids and easily treatable -
except the local hospital turned
I ,her away as neither she nor
KENW A could afford the admission
fees.
To many people reading the
newspapers this week, she would
be one of the 2.3 million Africans
. that UNAIDS estimates have
P.'died of Aids in the past year, the
two children part of the increasing
12 million children estimated
to have been
orphaned by Aids
in the same period.
However, for
Wagura the statistics
do not reveal
much. She, like
many other Kenyans,
dispute
whether Kenya's
HIV prevalence
rate has actually
declined from 13.6
per cent in 1997
and 1998, to 9.4
per cent in 2002,
as claimed by UNAIDS in its
annual AIDS Epidemic
Update.
According to her, the number of
Kenyans turning to KENWA for
help is not declining but actually
increasing. A reason why
UNAIDS cautions that the
recent declines in East Africa's
epidemic may not herald a definitive
reversal in these countries
epidemics, and evidence of what
the agency warns will be increasing
numbers of people needing
treatment, care and support.
Lucas Gichamba is a 25-year-old
volunteer care-giver in Kiandutu,
n informal settlement about 45
s from Nairobi. In Janue
was bedridden with TB,
st his job in a local illegal brewry
and kicked out of the homes
in which he sought refuge. He
eventually found shelter within
the walls of KENWA's Kiandutu
Home-based Care Centre.
Makeshift ambulance
Nursed back to good health by
Josephine Wanjini, the project
manager in Kiandutu, Gichamba
now works at the centre caring
for both men and women. He
pulls a makeshift ambulance
through the makeshift roads that
weave themselves like a maze
through the wooden and tin
shacks of Kiandutu, to bring critically
ill patients requiring care
to the centre.
Despite being a volunteer,
Gichamba does not know
whether he needs anti-retroviral
drugs. In Kenya a person can
only access the life-prolongihg
drugs once you have paid for a
series of tests, including a CD4
cell count test. This test measures
how well the immune system is
functioning - once the CD4 cell
count falls to below 20ll, it is recommended
that the person, commences
anti-retroviral treatment.
Lost their savings
The combined tests cost Shl,200.
If Gichamba needed ARVs, the
drugs alone would cost him
Sh500 a month, and he would
need to pay for the tests at least
once every six months.
Many people living with HIV/
Aids that require treatment have
already lost their savings, their
jobs and, for subsistence farmers,
the ability to work the land.
According to one journalist,
many people living with HIV/
Aids, particularly in the rural
areas, die of starvation as they
are unable to work the land and
earn an income.
The Sh2,400 it would require for
a person to start treatment could
buy three bags of maize meal,
vegetables for a month, cooking
oil and soap.
Indeed, if the UNAIDS warning
that more people
will in the immediate
future
require greater
care and treatment
is ignored,
then many people
may have to
make the decision
between
having food or
buying the lifeprolonging
drugs.
As an unemployed
volunteer
who earns no
income, life may
soon be beyond
the reach of
Lucas, unless a
donor comes forward or the government
revisits its pricing policies
on ARVs.
Cost of treatment
Patrick Orege of the National
Aids Control Council of Kenya
says that the government is
investigating ways of reducing
the costs of treatment, with the
possibility of treatment being
made available to all those who
need it.
But it's not only the families and
individuals that have to make
hard decisions. Even organisations
such as KENWA are faced
daily with many difficult decisions.
The project in Kiandutu is currently
feeding 120 orphans and
caring for some 40 bed-ridden
clients. Asked whether the
project provides support to children
not orphaned by Aids,
Wanjini, herself HIV-positive,
looks away and says that they
cannot afford to provide such a
service and have had to turn children
away.
Even more worrying for Wanjini
and the people receiving care
through the Kiandutu project is
the fact that it only has funding
until next February. It is currently
funded by the Global
Fund for Aids, TB and Malaria.
Asked what will happen after
this date, Wanjini shakes her
head, looks up to the sky and
says simply, "In God we trust."



CARING MAN AMONGST WOMEN
"Men just can't deal with the sight of a sick
woman, they do not want to touch her or
clean her," says Lucas Gichamba, a 25-
year-old volunteer who is himself living
withHIV.
Finding a man who is a care-giver is rare,
whether it is in Kenya or in South Africa.
But Gichamba is a man among men, challenging
stereotypes and undertaking community
awareness roles.
Daily he ventures through the streets of
Kiandutu ~alling on patients, the majority
of whom are women, to clean and bathe
them, cook for them, do their laundry,
clean their houses and look after their children.
Occasionally, he pulls a makeshift
ambulance through the narrow dirt roads
of Kiandutu to take seriously ill patients
needing care to a care centre.
Care is often regarded in
Africa as a woman's job,
which is why men will seldom
work as care-givers. In
the local community, some
men call him brave, others
say he is insane. For
Gichamba, it does not matter
what they say. "It was
not men who helped me, it
was women and I would
not be alive if it was not for
the woman who helped
me,"
That woman is Josephine
Wanjini, who has lived with Gichamba: "Aids is every.
HIV for the p~st 13 years. one's disease."
She nursed Glchamba back
to health in January this. 
despite the fact that his health
was failing fast. He had been
kicked out of two homes where
he sought shelter and was left
with nowhere to go but the
KENW A Centre in Kiandutu.
Following his recovery, Wanjini
counselled him about HIV/
Aids and convinced him to go
for an HIV antibody test,
which came back positive.
For Gichamba, caring for people
who are sick with an HIV/
Aids-related illness is not just a
woman's job. "This is not a
man's or woman's disease -
it is everyone's disease," he
says.The writer is the Advocacy and Media Adviyear

the time, Lucas had no idea that he had HIV,
