{"text": "\ufeffDaily Nation! Tuesday, November 23, 2004 \r\nWe're victims of interested group hysteria and general insecurity, says firm\r\nDaggers drawn at restive Del Monte again\r\nNOOs, led by the Kenya Human\r\nRights Commission (KHRC), were to\r\nact as independent monitors to ensure\r\nthat the company kept its end of the\r\nbargain ..\r\nDaniel Kyule, a veteran of the protests\r\nof the late 90s and current national\r\n. chairman of the Kenya Union of Com- b... mercial ~ood and A~lied Workers (Kuf-\r\n,... caw), whIch had to fIght to be recog-\r\n[f;. nised by the management, says a lot has\r\n~ changed at Del Monte since those frac-\r\n~ tious days.\r\n1(;' \"Our campaign was not in vain and I I am proud of it. Today, this firm is a bet-\r\n, ter employer and neighbour.\r\n,. \"The minimum wage in the plantations\r\nis Sh6,SOO,excluding other benefits\r\nlike housing and healthcare for the\r\n223 workers. Even for the casuals in the\r\nfactories, the least paid gets $51 (Sh413)\r\na day, which is far better than most\r\nfirms in this kind of business. But most\r\nimportant is that the firm has embraced\r\ndialogue with its workers and neighbours,\"\r\nhe says.\r\nThe firm has a total workforce of\r\nabout 6,000 employees on which it uses\r\nSh1.2 billion salaries and benefits a\r\nyear.\r\nIn order to get its products back on\r\nED market shelves, which currently\r\ntake up about 90 per cent of its output\r\nand previously bought everything, it has\r\nhad to achieve the highest benchmarks\r\nin corporate behaviour and farm practice.\r\n\"We are the only firm in Africa out of\r\nSouth Africa to receive a Social\r\nAccountability 8000 certification.\r\nThis means every six months, all our\r\n~ operations regarding workers rights,\r\nenvironmental rights, health, safety and\r\nsocial development are audited by an\r\nindependent group from Europe. We\r\nare also ISO 900112000 certified,\" says\r\nDr Bertolli.\r\nIn\u00b7the latest flare-up, Del Monte has\r\nbeen put on the dock after its guards -\r\nthe firm employs a staggering 285 to\r\nsecure its pineapple plantations! -\r\nunleashed dogs on a group of people\r\nwho are alleged to have been stealing\r\nripe fruit.\r\nThe matter has since gone to court,\r\nbut the reverberations it has ignited run\r\ndeep:\r\nA fresh slate of demands has been\r\ntabled by residents of one of the villages\r\nneighbouring the factory and a slew of\r\nlocal and Nairobi-based lobbies that\r\nhave taken up their cause.\r\nA meeting held by the two sides on\r\nNovember 9 to resolve the issue ended\r\nin gridlock after the firm refused to discuss\r\ncompensation for the dog bite victims\r\nand a new grouse: some 38 women\r\nwho had been allegedly raped by the\r\nfirm's guards over the last three years.\r\n. But the firm insisted that these matters\r\nwere criminal and should be handled\r\nby the criminal justice syst~m. At\r\nthat parley activist and former MP Njeru\r\nKathangu gave out single names of\r\nguards who had allegedly committed the\r\nacts of rape.\r\n\"We do not condone crime by any\r\nmember of staff. We only ask for full\r\ninformation before we can act and single\r\nnames simply won\u2019t do. There are no\r\ncover-ups for the simple reason that we\r\nhave nothing to hide and rn these days of\r\ntransparency and monitoring, it would\r\nclearly not work in our favour,\u201d says Dr\r\nBertolli.\r\n1-le has discerned an interesting pat\r\ntern in the agitation against the firm\r\nover the years. While the villagers are\r\nmore concerned with what the firm can\r\ndo to improve their lot, the NGOs are\r\nkeener on more protracted issues like\r\ncompensation, which \u201cprovide for racier\r\nheadlines.\u201d Dialogue suffers as the two\r\nsides pull in different directions.\r\nEvidence would seem to bear him oui,\r\naccording to documents obtained by\r\nBusiness Week.\r\nThe firm says il can only do so much\r\nin \u201cplaying government.\u201d Its corporate\r\nsocial responsibility (SR) programme,\r\non which it spent ShlO million last year,\r\nconcentrates on water provision, envi\r\nronmental improvement, HI V/Aids\r\nawareness and famine relief among oth\r\ners.\r\n\u201cWe do not believe in handouts, so we\r\ndon\u2019t give them. The entire fulcrum of\r\nour CSR platform is partnership with\r\nthe community since this is the only way\r\nto make our projects sustainable says\r\nhuman resources manager Purity Muth\r\namia.\r\nBut is Del M\u00f4nte the victim of what\r\nhas been called the protest industry in\r\nKenya. a factor which has been fmgered\r\nas one of the biggest emerging threats to\r\ninvestment of any sort in this country,\r\nwith professional critics and ambulance-\r\nchasing activists waiting in the wings to\r\ntorpedo any investment for donors\u2019 dol\r\nlars and persona] promotion?\r\nDr Bertolli is non-committal, but he is\r\nconcerned that some of the NGOs only\r\nsurface when there is a problem around\r\nwhich to agitate.\r\nDel Monte\u2019s 28-strong population of\r\nwhat it insists are \u201ctrained and disci\r\nplined\u201d canines has been an emotive\r\nmatter between the transnational and\r\nthe local community, which views their\r\nuse as oppressive and a hangover from\r\nthe dark days of colonialism.\r\nBut there are also deep sociological\r\nnuances. True, man\u2019s best friend has\r\nalways been a strong symbol of hatred\r\nand invective in African society.\r\nThe firm maintains it is compelled to\r\nuse them only when its guards are\r\nattacked by \u201cmachete-wielding pineap\r\nple thieves.\u201d\r\n\u201cMost of the time, we are not dealing\r\nwith petty thieves, but well-organised\r\ngangs of sometimes as many as 100\r\narmed men. Our employees have been\r\nattacked in the past and even one guard\r\ngot killed. We have a right to protect\r\nourselves,\u201d interjects Ms Muthamia.\r\nEfforts to outsource the costly secu\r\nrity component of its function to other\r\nfirms, so that it does not directly take\r\nthe flak for any spats with the commu\r\nnity have collapsed.\r\nA fencing project failed to stand after\r\nvillagers uprooted the structure.\r\nThe firm needs at least 1,500 tonnes\r\nof fruit a day to keep operating at 80 per\r\ncent capacity. Given the seasonal nature\r\nof the crop, it takes precise planning lo\r\nensure there is adequate supply\r\nthroughout the year.\r\nBulk stealing \u2014 which the firm says\r\npersists despite its interventions \u2014\r\n-upsets this delicate equilibrium.\r\nAs the battle drums are sounded for\r\nanother season of ferment over the suc\r\nculent fruits that threaten to become the\r\ncurse of Thika, it is the kind of distrac\r\ntion Dr Bertolli can do without."}
