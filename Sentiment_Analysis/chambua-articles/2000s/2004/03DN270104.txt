Women's conference to
tackle HIV/Aids scourge

By Nation correspondent
Morethan 4,000 women delegates
will gather in Nairobi
next month for a conference
on i s.
The three-day meeting will empower
participants with the skills to fight the
scourge, Health minister Charity Ngilu
announced yesterday.
"Women and girls are the most vulnerable
and susceptible to HIV/Aids infection
and they therefore need to be
empowered to enable them bargain for
safe sex," Mrs Ngilu said at a workshop
at a Nairobi hotel.
She added: "At the same time, retrogressive
cultural practices such as
female circumcision and wife inherit-
ance need to be addressed for meaningful
results to be achieved".
The conference, the minister said,
aimed at catalysing women leadership
in influencing behaviour change.
Water minister Martha Kama, assistant
ministers Alicen Chelaite and Betty
Tett, MPs Cecily Mbarire, Adelina
Mwau, Jayne Kihara and other women
leaders attended the workshop. It was
organised by the ministry and an NGO,
Women Advocacy for Rural Development.
Ms Karua urged the participants to
"fine-tune" the proposed HIV and Aids
Prevention and Control Bill and ensure
it addresses the missing gender gaps in
the fight against the disease.
