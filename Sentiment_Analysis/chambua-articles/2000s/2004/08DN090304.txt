precedence over the national collective will.
   The changes contained in the drafts - the Constitution
of Kenya (Amendment) Bill and the Constitution of Kenya
Review (Amendment) Bill - effectively removes
constitution-making from Bomas and gives it on Parliament.
   Significantly, the Bills spell out a new programme that
provides for a referendum on the whole document and seeks
to amend sections of the law that guide constitution-making.
   All these will take at least seven months, meaning that
Kenyans can only hope to see a new constitution by October
at the earliest - not in June as previously promised by
President Kibaki.
   In a nutshell, Narc has moved to reverse the pledges it
made to Kenyans, clearly demonstrating that it has no
qualms about reneging on a solemn pledge on reform, the
platform on which it was elected.                                                                                               ED STANDARDS 0 SIMON ETHANGAnA
   When Kenyans spoke of a people-driven constitution, it
meant they did not trust Parliament to give them a
document that captures their interests, needs and
aspirations.                                                                                  Horticulture industry in real peril
   It is precisely on that account that those now in
