Most Aids patients in towns

Study says HIV prevalence rate in urban areas stands at 10 per cent
By JEFF OTIENO

Urban centres have twice as many HIV
positive patients as rural areas, the new
Kenya Demographic and Health Survey
says.
According to the document, Aids
prevalence rate in urban centres is lo.
per cent while that of rural arcas stands
at 6 per cent.
Researchers who compiled the docu
ment cited the observance of culture in
rural arcas as one of the major reasons
that had kept the figures low, unlike in
the urban centres where cultural norms
took a back seat.
The report, launched yesterday, cites
Nyariza and Nairobi as having the high
est L-IIV/Aids prevalence with 14 and
nine per cent respectively. North East
ern has thc lowest with less than one
per cent of its population being HIV
positive. Coast has 6.0, Central 5.9, Rift
Valley 5.2 and Eastern 4.1.
According to the report, new Aids
infections have continued to decline in
the past four years.
It says the current prevalence rate
stands aI 6.7, down from 12 per cent
five ýears ago.
More women infecled .
The results also show the disease infects
more women than men, with the former
having a rate of 8.7 per cent and the
latter 4.3.
The figures differ from those of the
ministry of Health’s sentinel survey
which put the country’s prevalence rate
at 9.4 per cent.
Sentinel surveys arc a continuous
research on the I-IlVfAids undertaken
by the Health ministry, targeting preg
nant women and specific antenatal
clinics. The results are expected to
arouse controversy from the NGOs
which still insist that the prevalence
rate was above 10 per cent and that
Aids kills between 500 and 700 people
every day.
Officials from the Central Bureau of
Statistics have dismissed as untrue the
death rate claims.
The document was launched yester
day by Planning minister Anyang’
Nyong’o in Nairobi.
A total of 8,561 out of 8,889 house
holds targeted, responded to the
interviews.
The survey also found oui that the
proportion of women who were HIV
positive rose rapidly with age, from four
per cent among the 15-19 years, to 12
per cent in the 25-29 age group.
It stabilises among the 25-39 years
before dropping Co five per cent in the
45-49 age group.
Contraceptive use - which determines
the number of children a woman ca_____
have - has remained the same in the l& _.
five years.
Contrnceptive use
According to the survey, more women
prefer using injectables than pills, add
ing the proportion of women using the
former had continued to decline in 1998
to four per cent in 2003.
Condom use, the document says, is
highest in urban areas at 2.3 per cent
and lowest in rural areas (0.9 per cent).
Men in the age bracket of 15 and 19
years lead in the use of condoms with
those aged between 45 and 49 using it
the least (0.6 per ccnt).
