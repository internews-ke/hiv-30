{"text": "\ufeffDaily Nation/ Thursday September 30, 2004\r\n\r\nACCESS TO ARVS TO IMPROVE FURTHER\r\n\r\nDue to accelerated\r\nprice drop, there has\r\nbeen a 10-fold rise in\r\ndemand between\r\n2000 and 2003 .\r\n\r\nBy Correspondent\r\nAccessibility to HIV drugs in Kenya is\r\ndue to improve further with the\r\nanticipation that other local pharmaceutical\r\ncompanies are going to apply\r\nfor production rights from British drug manufacturer\r\nGlaxoSmithKline.\r\nAccording to Dr William Mwatu, medical and\r\nregulatory director at GlaxoSQ1ithKline, who\r\nvoluntarily gave production rights to Cosmos last-\r\n, such requests will be assessed on their own\r\n;,ts as they came..\r\nWider coverage\r\n\"The more partners we can involve in the fight\r\nagainst the disease will translate into a wider\r\ncoverage in the region,\" Dr Mwatu told Horizon\r\nrecently.\r\n\"Due to the accelerated drop in prices, there\r\nhas been a 10-fold rise in demand between 2000\r\n~. and 2002,\" he explained.\r\nLast week, GSK gave the green light to Cosmos\r\nto start producing generic versions of the\r\ndrugs Epivir and Retrovir, for the three East\r\nAfrican Community countries, as well as\r\nRwanda and Burundi. Prior to the signing of the\r\nagreement, GSK held the patent and the sole\r\nrights to manufacture and distribute the drugs\r\nacross the region ..\r\nAccording to Dr Prakash Patel, the chairman\r\nand chief executive of Cosmos, the new development\r\ncould see the price of ARVs in the region\r\nfall by as much as 40 per cent.\r\nPrice reductions\r\n\"When everything is on full stream, the price\r\nreductions will be in the region of 40 to 50 per\r\ncent,\" Dr Patel has been quoted as saying.\r\n\"Because of experiences learnt from this\r\nground-breaking agreement, we anticipate that\r\nfuture negotiations will take a shorter time,\"\r\npredicted Dr Mwatu who said that the negotiations\r\nbetween the two parties had taken a whole\r\none year.\r\nThe interpretation of what constitutes a good\r\npartn~r is one who offers high quality products,\r\nare accessible and such an initiative is\r\nsustainable. The generics or any other medical\r\ndrug,.says Dr Mwatu are only helpful if they can get\r\nto the patients on time, are in good quality and are\r\naccessible to patients who need them. More partners\r\nare expected to translate to a wider distribution\r\nnetwork that is closer and responsive to the\r\nlocal people.\r\n\"Our decision to voluntarily allow Cosmos and\r\npossibly other companies later is part of our social\r\nresponsibility in fighting what can be termed the\r\nbiggest health crisis in recent times,\" said Dr\r\nMwatu.\r\nOn loyalties, he says, GSK is only asking Cosmos\r\nto pay 5 per cent instead of the industry average\u00b7of\r\n25 per cent. \"This means we are giving away some\r\nof our rights and we are convinced it is for the bigger\r\ngood for the region.\"\r\nCurrently, GSK sells antiretrovirals products at\r\npreferential prices in Sub-Saharan Africa and will\r\ncontinue to do so for the foreseeable future. GSK is\r\nalso involved in various collaborative studies in\r\nAfrica with among others the Kenya Medical\r\nResearch Institute and the Centers for Disease\r\nControl to find new protocals in the management\r\nof HIV.\r\n\"Aparffrom investing in studies to come up with\r\nnew therapies, the various arms of research are also\r\ninvestigating new HIV management technologies,\"\r\nsays Dr Mwatu. One of their concerns, they say,\r\nis to help bring down the cost associated with\r\nthe management of HIV which, combined, constitute\r\na significant cost component So they\r\nare asking such questions like: Is it possible to\r\nfind new ways of diagnosing and monitoring the\r\nprogression of HIV that are us~ful in resource\r\npoor countries?\r\n\"We are investigating alternative methods of\r\nmonitoring patients on retrovirals that can be\r\nuseful in this part of the world,\" he said\r\nAccording to the World Trade Organisation's\r\nintellectual property law, a voluntary licence\r\nsuch as the one granted by GSK to Cosmos can\r\nonly be awarded by the patent holder to a third\r\nparty. In extreme cases, however, countries facing\r\nmedical emergencies can unilaterally issue\r\ncompulsory licences to allow local firms to make\r\nmedicines locally.\r\nGenerics\r\nLast week, during the brief ceremony at GSK\r\nheadquarters in Nairobi, at which Cosmos was\r\nofficially given the go-ahead to produce the\r\ngenerics, Kenyan Trade and Industry Minister,\r\nDr Mukhisa Kituyi, said that he had not yet\r\nruled out the possibility invoking compulsory\r\nlicences for ARVs whose patents are held by\r\nmultinationals who were reluctant to do so voluntarily.\r\n\"We prefer to see multinational companies\r\nissue voluntary licences to local firms as GSK\r\nhas done,\" Dr Kituyi, a strong voice for the\r\ndeveloping world at WTO parleys, said. \"If need\r\nbe, however, we will issue compulsory licences.\"\r\nChurch programmes\r\nCurrently, only about 60,000 HI V-positive East\r\nAfricans out of an estimated 600,000 who need\r\ntreatment for Aids are on ARVs, mostly\r\nthrough government, NGO or church-supported\r\nprogrammes using imported generics. Treatment\r\nat Kenyan government hospitals currently\r\ncosts about Sh3,000 ($38) a month.\r\nOther Kenyan firms which have expressed an\r\nintention to start producing generic ARVs are\r\nLaboratory & Allied and Universal\r\nPharmaceuticals."}
