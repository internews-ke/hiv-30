But if after\r\n that we fail to see much improvement, then IAVI will terminate the\r\ntesting of this vaccine and embark on its other vaccine projects,\" says\r\n Dr Crispin Kambili.\r\n   The vaccine candidates, scientifically known as DNA.HIV A and\r\n MVA.HIV A are jointly owned by the Oxford University of Britain\r\n and University of Nairobi in Kenya. Their development cost more\r\n than one billion shillings.\r\n    The 439 study volunteers, among them 106 in Kenyans, 50 in Ugan-\r\n dans, and 222 British, overwhelmingly participated in various phases\r\n of the study whose results established the vaccine's safety when used\r\n in human beings.\r\n    The volunteers, who have been monitored for over a year after vac-\r\n cination while being subjected to extensive medical examinations,\r\n have not revealed any serious side effects.\r\n    The vaccine becomes the second Aids vaccine candidate - which\r\n has reached human trials- to fail. Last year, AidsVax, developed by\r\n VaxOen of the US, also failed to give the desired results.\r\n    This new development has other immediate implications. IAVI's\r\n planned trials in the Netherlands and Rwanda, based on the Kenya\r\n candidate, will not go on. Recruitment of volunteers in South Africa-\r\n Durban and Johannesburg, and Switzerland, has also been halted.\r\n                                             CONTINUED ON PAGE 24\r\n          Local researchers develop Kiswahili software\r\n     By Patrick Ngugi                                      papers or novels being read to them by a compu-      South Africa, and Ibibio of Nigeria.                through which you can speak Kiswahili io your\r\n                                                           ter.
