.                It matters little where such complaints come from.
     They have to be investigated as soon as they are brought to the
  attention of the watchdog bodies and if there is enough ground for
  dissatisfaction with a particular buying process, a ruling should be
  made promptly and immediately communicated to all the concerned
  parties.
     The recent decision by the Government to annul and call afresh for
  bids in a lucrative Sh1.5 billion tender to supply the port of Mombasa
  with eight cranes is the perfect mascot for a working system, one that

  (Economic Planning), Mukhisa Kituyi (Trade and Industry) and John
  Michuki (Transport and Communications) had been placed sq'uarely
  on the dock by Parliament for allegedly putting pressure on the KPA
  management to have the bid opening postponed twice for the direct ,
  benefit ofa certain late bidder.
    The lesson that must be learnt is that efficient public procurement
 systems do not work because they are perfect. They do because they                                                                                                         AMBROSE MURUNGA
