Health experts
Women are now starting to have sex
slightly later than before, the statistics
show: from 16.7 years in 1998 to
17.8 years today. Health experts
regard this as encouraging because
the younger the woman is when she
initiates sex, the more likely she is to
be infected with HIV.
And there is more good news: with
HIV/Aids in the spotlight comes the
disclosure that far fewer people are
suffering from the virus than previously
feared.
Current estimates of HIV/Aids infection
have been almost halved, from
about 13 per cent to seven per cent.
The new estimate of seven per cent is
more reliable because for the first
time since the emergence of HIV/
Aids in Kenya, prevalence has been
calculated from actual blood samples
taken throughout the country,
instead of just blood taken from
mothers attending ante-natal clinics
at selected sites, then estimated
nationally through mathematical formulae.
Sadly, the survey also shows that
more Kenyans are dying today than
they were a decade ago.
They are eating poorly and fewer
children are being immunised, while
families are getting bigger all the
time.
Mortality is higher
Previous gains in critical areas like
child survival, family planning, and
mothers' health are sliding back.
The survey reveals more adult deaths
than 10 years ago, with more women
dying younger than men, but after
the age of 39 male mortality is higher.
The Kenya Demographic and lIealth
Survey will be launched today by
Planning minister Anyang' Nyong'o
and his health counterpart, Mrs
Charity Ngilu.
The last such survey was in 1998 and
its main objective is to provide facts
for policy makers, planners and
rescarchers.
Data was collected over five months
period in 2003 from a national representative
sample of 10,000 households.
The study was by the Central Bureau
of Statistics with the Ministry of
Health, KEMRI, NASCOP and the
National Council for Population and
Development with external funding
from several donors.

THE REPORT WILL BE LAUNCHED TODAY BY THE HEALTH MINISTER.
