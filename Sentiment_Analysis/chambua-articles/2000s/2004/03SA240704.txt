AIDS UNIT BLAMED OVER FUNDS DELAY

The National Aids Control Council has
blamed the Government's control units
for the delay in releasing the Sh400 million
World Bank funding.
NACC has spent only Sh264 million
of the funds because of poor accounting,
said Dr Patrick Orege, the council's
director.
"The greatest challenge facing the
Aids control units is to prepare clear
work plans, use and account for funds
faster," he said.
He was addressing Administration
Police officers, their families and guests
yesterday at Uhuru Camp, Nairobi, during
the launch of the Administration
Police Aids Control Unit.
Dr Orege urged the units to take up
more activities and hasten accounting
and distribution of their funds before
next year when the project ends.
Out of the Government's order of 300
million condoms in a project that ends
next June, only 100 million had been dis·
tributed, he said.
Although the national HIV prevalence
level stood at 9.4 per cent, it was
higher among special social groups like
the police.
"Such special risk groups are posted
to work under challenging conditions in
remote parts of the country and away
from their families," he said and urged
officers to be self-disciplined to avoid
contracting the disease.
