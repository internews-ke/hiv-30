World marks
Aids Vaccine
Day today

By NATION Correspondent
The World Aids Vaccine Day is to be
marked today.
The occasion is observed globally, and
calls for a vaccine that will prevent HIV
and Aids infection. Many scientists and
world leaders agree that the vaccine is
Tte only answer.
According to estimates, 14,000 people
in Kenya contract HIV everyday, and
most develop Aids and die. ,
More than 2 million have died of the
disease since the first case was diag
nosed in 1984.
Prevention measures
Prevention measures like public educa
tion only curb new infections, and treat
ment only helps parlents to live longer.
But they cannot end the epidemic.
Ln a statement, International Aids
Vaccine Initiative (IAVL) president and
chief executive Seth Berkley said: “We
must develop a vaccine to end this glo
bal pandemic. Vaccines stop epidemics
like polio and smallpox, and two dozen
other diseases have been eradicated or
controlled, thanks to vaccines.”
Since HIV and Aids were identified
more than 20 years ago, scientists have
believed that a vaccine is possible. But it
is only in the past five years that the
world has begun to make progress in
research for its development.
A number of pharmaceutical and bio
technology companies, academic labora
tories and government institutes are
involved in the global effort.
30 candidates
Currently, trials of 30 candidates span
19 countries on six continents. IAVL has
helped to advance five of these candi
dates, the statement added.
But there are still significant challeng
es, one of them being that HIV can
change its shape to outwit most tradi
tional ways of making vaccines.
All but two of the vaccine candidates
in trials are in the early stage of testing,
and more must advance to larger trials.
“HIV is one of the toughest viruses we
have yet battled. The only thing that will
beat it is the human brain,” said IAVI’s
Dr Dennis Burton.
