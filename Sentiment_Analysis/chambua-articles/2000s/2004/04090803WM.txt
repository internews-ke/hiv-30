{"text": "\ufeffDaily Nation/ September 8, 2004\r\nSEXPERT\r\nI am looking for a place whee I can buy sex toys.\r\nThey are the best thing to have in this era of HIV\r\nAids. Do you know where I can buy them ni Ken\r\nya? Or can I be allowed to import them\u2019? If these\r\nthings were openly obtainable, they would help to\r\ncombat HW!Aids, rapes etc.\r\nKavu Muingi\r\nniiiinai\u2019vhnn rOm::\r\nHow are the toys likely to help combat rapes? You\r\nseem to think that rape is all about sex. Rape is\r\nabout power. You sound so knowledgable about\r\nthe capabilities of these toys that I am surprised\r\nyou do not where or how to get them,\r\nYOU\u2019RE A HOME WRECKER\r\nYour manners of solving problems is very weird. I\r\nrefer to \u201cI Cant Let Go of This Drunk\u201d (Septem\r\nben). How do you advise someone to divorce her\r\nhusband because he is a drunkard. The problem the\r\nman is undergoing can be resolved. Instead of\r\nadvising the lady to help her husband get out of his\r\nproblem. you advise her to leave him. You are like\r\nthose FIDA women who break homes. Everybody\r\nhas a weakness and they need just a little help. Do\r\nyou want to tell me that the next time someone tells\r\nyou that hisiher spouse is HIV -positive you will\r\nadvise them to run away? Please quit that job\r\nbefore you lead us asnay.\r\nDavid Odhiambo\r\n:ptpunpressjpnsr1ippcom\r\nWhat problem is the man undergoing and what is\r\nhis weakness? Life dictates that that a drunkard be\r\navoided at all costs because drunkenness is not a\r\ndisease. It is sheer irresponsibility, to put it plainly.\r\nA perpetually drunk man rs already a nome\r\nbreaker. and HlY\u00ecAids is a condition and the per\r\nson living with H1Y\u2019Aids needs care. but a drunk\r\nard just wants more alcohol. Get it?\r\nWiite to Mrs Manda, P.O. Box 49010,00100 GPO,\r\nNairobi; e.mail.m manda.:naon.co Ice"}
