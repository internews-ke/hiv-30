PRESIDENT WAIVE TAX ON SANITARY PADS

BY SUNDAY NATION CORRESPONDENT

President Mwai Kibaki yesterday
waived the Valued Added Tax and
other taxes levied on women's sanitary
~els .
. You shall not pay a cent more. 1
instruct that manufacturing companies,
traders and all those concerned to
immediately stop charging extra," the
President said, amidst cheers and ululation
from the women participants.
The President Kibaki was responding
to a request by Health minister
Charity Ngilu who pointed out that
many women were exposed to infections
when they opt to use unhygienic
alternatives like old blankets and toilet
paper.
The President was officially opening
of the First National Women's Conference
on HIV/Aids at Kasarani Sports
Gymnasium, Nairobi.
Nominated MP Njoki Ndung'u
praised the move. "We tried to engage
the previous government on this issue,
but we are ~appy with this great
stride," she said, adding that sanitary
pads had been one of the highest taxed
goods.
The executive director of Fida, Ms
Jane Kirago, said part of their advocacy
campaign was to widen access of
sanitary pads to poor women and girls
in the rural areas. "I am really excited
about the tax waiver. The biological
process is not within our control," she
said.
A woman menstruates at least 12
times a year, which translates to at
least 450 times from puberty to menopause.
At the cost of ShlOOa month, a
woman spends about Sh45,000 in her
lifetime on sanitary Dads.


AIDS: KIBAKI'S NEW DIRECTIVE
BY OSCAR OBONYO

Identify all the HIV sufferers for assistance
President Kibaki has directed that every
HIV /Aids sufferer in each corner of the
country be immediately identified for
possible medical assistance.
And to achieve this, the Head of State
proposes that the Nation,al Aids Control
Council (NACC) whittles down its composition
and mandate right to the smallest
administrative unit - the village.
"Every village in every corner of this
country should set up an HIV/Aids committee
to identify those who are ailing
from the disease. It is a lot easier to
identify them at this level as most are
either family members or known neighbours,"
said the President.
He hopes that at the village level,
each and every suff~rer is likely to be
tracked down, identified, counselled and
requested to access medication.
"This is the only way we can corner
this 'thing' and wipe it out completely,"
he told participants of the First National
Women's Conference on HIV/Aids in
Nairobi's Kasarani Sports Gymnasium
yesterday.
The President was presiding over the
official opening of the three-day event
attended by 4,000 women. He appealed
to all affected not to shy away from
reality.
"We are taking the war to the village
levels because we want to assist each
and everyone, especially those who are
embarassed of their condition," he said
pleading with them to open up because
"hiding is tantamount to willingly
wasting away to the grave".
The first family, led by the President
himself, has been in the forefront in
fighting the spread of the virus after
officially launching the campaigns in
March last year.
The President was however not
accompanied by the First Lady, Mrs
Lucy Kibaki, as has been the tradition
since he ascended to power in December
2002.
Mrs Kibaki, a member of the
Organisation of African First Ladies
Against Aids (OAFLA), has opened a
Kenyan chapter of the organisation and
is a leading crusader of behaviour
change.
Speaking earlier, Health minister
Charity Ngilu stressed the need to combat
the HIV/Aids scourge by focusing
on women.
"Women are the most vulnerable and
most helpless victims of this condition
and that is why we thought it important
to start our campaigns by involving this
lot," she explained.
But the President appeared to contradict
her when he reiterated the need to
give both men and women equal
involvement opportunities in fighting
against the pandemic.
"It is erroneous to tell men to wait as
you forge forward with the women.
These two should move together as
none should be left behind," he said
amidst cheers from the women
participants.
