{"text": "\ufeffDaily Nation Tuesday, May 18, 2004\r\nMEDICINE\r\nWorld marks\r\nAids Vaccine\r\nDay today\r\n\r\nBy NATION Correspondent\r\nThe World Aids Vaccine Day is to be\r\nmarked today.\r\nThe occasion is observed globally, and\r\ncalls for a vaccine that will prevent HIV\r\nand Aids infection. Many scientists and\r\nworld leaders agree that the vaccine is\r\nTte only answer.\r\nAccording to estimates, 14,000 people\r\nin Kenya contract HIV everyday, and\r\nmost develop Aids and die. ,\r\nMore than 2 million have died of the\r\ndisease since the first case was diag\r\nnosed in 1984.\r\nPrevention measures\r\nPrevention measures like public educa\r\ntion only curb new infections, and treat\r\nment only helps parlents to live longer.\r\nBut they cannot end the epidemic.\r\nLn a statement, International Aids\r\nVaccine Initiative (IAVL) president and\r\nchief executive Seth Berkley said: \u201cWe\r\nmust develop a vaccine to end this glo\r\nbal pandemic. Vaccines stop epidemics\r\nlike polio and smallpox, and two dozen\r\nother diseases have been eradicated or\r\ncontrolled, thanks to vaccines.\u201d\r\nSince HIV and Aids were identified\r\nmore than 20 years ago, scientists have\r\nbelieved that a vaccine is possible. But it\r\nis only in the past five years that the\r\nworld has begun to make progress in\r\nresearch for its development.\r\nA number of pharmaceutical and bio\r\ntechnology companies, academic labora\r\ntories and government institutes are\r\ninvolved in the global effort.\r\n30 candidates\r\nCurrently, trials of 30 candidates span\r\n19 countries on six continents. IAVL has\r\nhelped to advance five of these candi\r\ndates, the statement added.\r\nBut there are still significant challeng\r\nes, one of them being that HIV can\r\nchange its shape to outwit most tradi\r\ntional ways of making vaccines.\r\nAll but two of the vaccine candidates\r\nin trials are in the early stage of testing,\r\nand more must advance to larger trials.\r\n\u201cHIV is one of the toughest viruses we\r\nhave yet battled. The only thing that will\r\nbeat it is the human brain,\u201d said IAVI\u2019s\r\nDr Dennis Burton."}
