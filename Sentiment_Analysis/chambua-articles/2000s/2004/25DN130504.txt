 Having fun with morning-after pills
By Arthur Okwemba                                                                                                                         LEARNING NEW TRICKS

                  irls as young as 14 are now major consumers of con-
                 with responsible boyfriends or, at most, are indulging
                 traceptive pills which are readily available in most
 G               pharmacies in Nairobi ..
                    This has shattered the widely held view by most
                 parents that their daughters are just 'henging' out
in safe sex.
   The demand for the pills is very high, with pharmacists we talked
to saying they make record sales over the weekends, month-ends and
during school holidays. One of them, located along Moi Avenue says
they sell an average of 50 packets in a day during these peak periods.
   "The trend is worrying. If the pills are not being used as an emer-
gency contraceptive, the young girls' immature genital tract risks
being disturbed," says Dr Irene Gathinji, a reproductive health
expert.
   What emerges from these observations is that young men and girls
- of more than average education - are engaging in unprotected sex
with full knowledge of the dangers of HIV and other sexually trans-
mitted infections. This is especially so as recent statistics show that
girls have a higher HIV infection rate ·than anybody else in the
                                              population.

                                              attendant: "If you try to
                                              caution them on overuse,
they will angrily tell you they know what they are doing."
   The 'Morning After' pill is a multiple dose emergency contracep-
tive designed to prevent conception through immobilising of the
sperm, stopping the implantation of the embryo if fertilization has
occurred, or suppressing a hormone known as the leutenising hor-
mone that triggers ovulation.
   The pill is taken within 72 hours from the time of having unpro-
tected sex, with the first and second pills being taken at an interval of.
12 hours.
   It is not effective if a woman is pregnant and cannot be used to
terminate a pregnancy that has taken rodt. The pills' prices locally
range from Sh 60 to Sh 120
   Although the pills are supposed to be used for emergency purposes
and at most twice a month, the teens are said to be using them like
chocolate.
   The current regular usage is against the manufacturers' recommen-
dation that the pills should not be used repetitively. However, there                                                                                                                                                           Photo/AP
