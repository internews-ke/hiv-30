Commission not the answer
       he Government      will within a fortnight decide whether
           This was said yesterday by Local Government
T       to dissolve Nairobi City Council.
Minister Karisa Maitha following up his threat a few weeks
ago to dissolve the scandal-tainted      council and replace it
with a commission.
   Many who are appalled and disgusted by the ineptitude,
corruption, waste and outright plunder that informs the
management       of our capital city might applaud if the mayor
and all his councillors were sent packing.
   But would the appointment        of a commission not
answerable to residents and rate-payers be the solution?
   We would urge caution. Nairobi, as well as most of our
other major urban areas including Mombasa, Kisumu and
Nakuru, have had the experience of being run by
Government-appointed         commissions.
   And the experiences were not pleasant. For the unelected
commissioners      looted and mismanaged      as effectively as the
sacked councillors. And because they were not answerable
to the voters - only to the minister who appointed them -
they were even more brazen about it.
   If the councillors have indeed looted, then the first course
of action should be to arrest and charged with criminal
offences. If found guilty, they can be sent to jail. They can                                                        WHAT OTHERS SAY 0 CHARLES ONYANGO-OBBO
also be made to repay what they may have stolen.
   Jailing the guilty might, in any case, provide city residents
the opportunity    to elect a more honest and effective lot.                            Next US First Lady could be 'African'
   Democracy,    as we know, is not perfect. But there is yet a
better system to be invented. But replacing elected
councillors, whatever their failings, with an unelected
bunch, is not democracy. Especially where experience                                                    irstcame the collapse of the        â€¢ If Kerry wins,                                    Nirbhay Gujjar, one of India's most-
