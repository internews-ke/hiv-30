One of her popular modifications is the the electronic iron box\r\n     which she and her father buy and modify to use battery power. They\r\n     sell the same for Sh 1,000, making a profit of between Sh 200 and 300\r\n     per piece. In the last few months she has sold about 400 pieces.\r\n         A beneficiary of Wambui's innovation, Mr Francis Gichuki, says\r\n     his family can now conveniently afford to bathe in warm water during\r\n     this cold season after obtaining a modified water heater.\r\n         \"My solar battery can store energy for up to four days and the\r\n     heater assists in boiling cooking water, thus saving on the scarce wood\r\n     fuel,\" he says.\r\n         Mr Gichuki added that though they border the Aberdare forest,\r\n     wood fuel has become rare since the government imposed restrictions\r\n     on tree felling..\r\n                                               The father of two, who hails\r\n                                          . from Kieni Division, says the\r\n     She has                                immersion water heater and the\r\n                                            modified solar powered iron box\r\n                                            Bellevue village.\r\n     already sold                           have also benefited residents of\r\n                                               \"Women from our village who\r\n     about 400                              have previously been using char-\r\n                                            coal iron boxes flock to our home\r\n     iron boxes                             on Sunday to iron their clothes,\"\r\n                                            says Mr Githuki who works with a\r\n                                            leading petroleum company in\r\n                                            Nairobi.\r\n         He says he installed solar panels to light his home but he still con-\r\n      tinued to use a charcoal iron box until early this year when he found\r\n      the modified iron box in one of the electronics shop in Nyeri town.\r\n         Mr Gichuki says the modified appliances came at the right' time\r\n      when many rural people are embracing solar power as a source of\r\n      energy.\r\n         \"It will take many decades for people like us living in the interior to .\r\n      get electricity and Wambui's innovation comes in handy since we now\r\n      enjoy most of the services available in urban areas,\" he says.\r\n         Salesmen at one of the leading electronics shops in Nyeri town said\r\n      the modified appliances are very popular with rural residents. \"We                                                                                                                                              Photos/Martin Telewa\r\n                                                                                     Roseline Wambui demonstrates to a customer how her modified immersion water heater works at a shop in Nyeri where\r\n                                                    CONTINUED ON PAGE 32             she supplies her appliances.\r\n      Call for mass HIVtesting at all public hospitals\r\n     By Arthur Okwemba                                                               dential, as the disease will be treated like any other.
