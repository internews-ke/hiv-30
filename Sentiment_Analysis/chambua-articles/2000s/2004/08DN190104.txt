       Health Organisation is losing the war against malaria.
T      he current issue of the authoritative medical journal,
       Lancet, carries a disturbing report on why the World
   Top medics say the continued use of chloroquin-based
drugs is to blame for the high malarial incidence and
resultant deaths, as the malaria-causing parasites have
gradually become chloroquin-resistant.
   Nonetheless, chloroquin continues to be used because it is
ten times cheaper than other drugs. In other words, people
are dying unnecessarily because they cannot afford the
proper medication.
   Of all 300 million cases reported every year, 90 per cent
are in Africa. In fact, malaria is killing 3,000 African children
every day.
   But the real tragedy about the disease is that it can be
treated. Better still, it can be prevented.
   Which brings us to some heart-warming news reported at
the weekend: Non governmental organisations and allied
groups have until April 5 to apply for funds from the United
Nation Global Fund for Aids, Malaria and Tuberculosis.
   As things stand now, Aids is getting all the attention and
for a good reason. It is a bigger killer than any other disease
at the moment. Malaria, on the other hand, remains at the
bottom of the pile.                                                                                                                   PUBLISHING 0 KING'ORI CHOTO
   In spite of growing political commitment, as reflected in
the Roll Back Malaria global partnership - born in 1998 and
adopted by African leaders in the Abuja Declaration in April
2000 - it has become necessary to direct adequate energies                                 It's possible to salvage gutter press
to make everyone recognise the grave consequences of
malaria.
   But all is not lost. Social workers and other activists should
