K       diplomacy. Kenyans approve because the Government
only what will benefit the whole nation.
   Whether they are singly or collectively effective in that
pursuit is any child's conjecture. Many roadblocks stand in
their way. Most have to do with policy and administrative
deficiencies of the mother ministry.
   Others stem from difficulties to be found in each country
of accreditation. But still others can be traced to purely
subjective personal shortcomings of each ambassador and
high commissioner.
   However, the Government seems to realise that these
handicaps exist. What tugs at the heart is that, every year, it
brings all the envoys home for collective stock-taking with
the relevant ministries.
   For Foreign Affairs (FA) is, in a number of ways, only a
clearing house. Accompanying each envoy are experts from
many other ministries, especially Agriculture, Tourism,
Tradc and Industry, Defence and Information and
Communication (IC).
   Information, indeed, is the nub of all of them - and of all
government. Though Ie does not seem to worry much about
