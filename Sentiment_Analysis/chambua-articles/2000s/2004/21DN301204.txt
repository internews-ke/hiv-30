reduce poverty
By Arthur Okwemba
                ocal scientists have now imported
                genetically modified cottonseeds
                bringing to two the number of GM
                crops being tested in the country.
                   The other crop isGM         maize
                which like cotton is being tested by
                Kenya Agricultural Research Insti-
                tute (Kari) at its fibre research
station in Mwea. Like for the maize, scientists
behind the technology are aggressively seIling the
message that Bt. cotton will alleviate poverty and
increase the yield from the current 20,000 bales
per year to 1980's level of 70,000 bales registered
in cotton belt areas like Kirinyaga, Busia, and
Bondo districts.
    But a recent study conducted in the same areas
by researchers at African Centre for Technology
Studies (ACTS) say Bt. cotton will not work if
introduced under the current policy environment.
    "Even if Bt. cotton is proved to be effective
after the trials, its economic, technical and 'ecologi-
cal potential may not be realised by smallholder
farmers in a country where conditions for the pro-
duction and marketing of cotton are poor," cau-
 tions the researchers who conducted the study -
 Introducing 81. Cotton: Policy Lessons for Small-
holder Framers in Kenya, 2004.
Financial assistance
The study cautions that if farmers find the tech-
nology expensive and fail to see its benefits, they
are likely to abandon it or not to adopt it at all.
Hence they should be well trained, provided with
technical and financial assistance, as well as being
given fair and balanced information about the
technology before adopting it.
   Other parties have also insisted that Bt. cotton
can only benefit smallholder farmers if they can
readily access markets and get attractive prices for                                                                                                                                                              Photo/AP
