ceutical company that wanted to talk to the Kenyan delegation .                                                                                                                     .10 fAULlf,.

   Impressed by the' drug's useful attributes the health minister
sought the opinion of Dr Muga on ordering the product. When the
DMS sought the opinion of Dr Koech, the latter sought to be pro-
vided with supporting documents about the product.
"On perusing the thick document, Dr Koech was shocked to find
that the first four scientific papers, quoted in the document were a
mirror reflection of his and Professor Arthur abel's work on Kem-
ron, the Aids management drug launched in Kenya more than a
decade earlier, " said our source.
   Our source says Dr Koech had calmly told Mrs Ngilu that what
was being marketed to them, packaged under the name Immuno-
plex, was nothing other than Kemron, the very same drug that that
