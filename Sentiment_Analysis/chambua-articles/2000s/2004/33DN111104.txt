    subtype A predominates. The more than 10 HIV strains circulating in
    the world are posing the biggest challenge and concern in the scien-
    tific community as the struggle to come up with a broad-based vac-
    cine. VRC's vaccine design is just or e of these attempts.
         Plans to start trials on the new '1accine"candidate come less than
    two months after interim results of another vaccine trial, spearheaded
    by Kenyan and British scientists, shllwed that it was not producing the
    desired immune response. Althought results of this vaccine may have
    been below expectations, the fact tbat they were carried out in Kenya
    has created a lot of interest in the country.
