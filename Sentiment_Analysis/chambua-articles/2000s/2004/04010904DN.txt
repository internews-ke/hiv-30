North East\r\nern has thc lowest with less than one\r\nper cent of its population being HIV\r\npositive. Coast has 6.0, Central 5.9, Rift\r\nValley 5.2 and Eastern 4.1.\r\nAccording to the report, new Aids\r\ninfections have continued to decline in\r\nthe past four years.\r\nIt says the current prevalence rate\r\nstands aI 6.7, down from 12 per cent\r\nfive \u00fdears ago.\r\nMore women infecled .\r\nThe results also show the disease infects\r\nmore women than men, with the former\r\nhaving a rate of 8.7 per cent and the\r\nlatter 4.3.\r\nThe figures differ from those of the\r\nministry of Health\u2019s sentinel survey\r\nwhich put the country\u2019s prevalence rate\r\nat 9.4 per cent.\r\nSentinel surveys arc a continuous\r\nresearch on the I-IlVfAids undertaken\r\nby the Health ministry, targeting preg\r\nnant women and specific antenatal\r\nclinics. The results are expected to\r\narouse controversy from the NGOs\r\nwhich still insist that the prevalence\r\nrate was above 10 per cent and that\r\nAids kills between 500 and 700 people\r\nevery day.\r\nOfficials from the Central Bureau of\r\nStatistics have dismissed as untrue the\r\ndeath rate claims.\r\nThe document was launched yester\r\nday by Planning minister Anyang\u2019\r\nNyong\u2019o in Nairobi.\r\nA total of 8,561 out of 8,889 house\r\nholds targeted, responded to the\r\ninterviews.\r\nThe survey also found oui that the\r\nproportion of women who were HIV\r\npositive rose rapidly with age, from four\r\nper cent among the 15-19 years, to 12\r\nper cent in the 25-29 age group.\r\nIt stabilises among the 25-39 years\r\nbefore dropping Co five per cent in the\r\n45-49 age group.\r\nContraceptive use - which determines\r\nthe number of children a woman ca_____\r\nhave - has remained the same in the l& _.\r\nfive years.\r\nContrnceptive use\r\nAccording to the survey, more women\r\nprefer using injectables than pills, add\r\ning the proportion of women using the\r\nformer had continued to decline in 1998\r\nto four per cent in 2003.\r\nCondom use, the document says, is\r\nhighest in urban areas at 2.3 per cent\r\nand lowest in rural areas (0.9 per cent).\r\nMen in the age bracket of 15 and 19\r\nyears lead in the use of condoms with\r\nthose aged between 45 and 49 using it\r\nthe least (0.6 per ccnt)."}
