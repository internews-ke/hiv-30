The centre has also been forced to train personnel in the\r\n  other centres where they refer patients.\r\n     Interestingly, Dr David Bukusi, the centre's project manager, says\r\n  between 70 and 80 per cent of those booked do come later and duly\r\n  honour their appointments.\r\n     VCT centres in Homabay and some in western Kenya are also reg-\r\n  istering higher numbers of people turning up for HIV testing. The\r\n  increase is estimated on average to be between 10 and 20 per cent.\r\n     Like other VCTs, Kenyatta is being forced to book clients because\r\n  its facilities and the staff are not sufficient to cope up with the huge\r\n  numbers.\r\n     The high turnout and the willingness to b~ tested seems to be as a\r\n  result of cheap ARVs that are giving people hope in life.\r\n     Many people now know that even if they turn positive, there is an\r\n. assurance of accessing the life prolonging drugs, whose monthly dose\r\n  is as low as Sh 1,000 in the private sector, and Sh 500 under the gov-\r\n  ernment ARVs programme.\r\n     Health analysts think the massive messages going out for people to\r\n  get tested seems to be impacting well. It is also an indication that\r\n  stigma and discrimination of people living with HIV/Aids is reducing\r\n  compared to what it was a decade ago.\r\n     Other doctors, say the new development might be due to HIV test-\r\n  ing'becoming a requirement in many facets of life.\r\n     Ironically, the huge responses are coming at time when the supply\r\n  of one of the rapid HIV tests kits, Uni-Gold, which is recommended\r\n  by the government, is running out of stock.\r\n     Some of the VCT officials we talked said they have run-out of the\r\n  kit, while others said their stocks will be exhausted in the next two\r\n  weeks.\r\n     Investigations by Horizon have found that the development is as                                                                                                                                                             ~.\r\n  result of the World Bank, which has been funding the procurement of\r\n  the kits, having pulled out last year to pave way for the Global Fund\r\n  on HIY/Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria to take over.\r\n     And that is where the problem started. The government had hoped\r\n  that the Global Fund intervention would set in immediately the                                                                                                                                                     Photo/AP\r\n  World Bank pulled out.                                             .\r\n     This was not to be.
