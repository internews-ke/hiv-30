Arid the principal players - the\r\n   Government and the Universities Academic Staff Union -\r\n   are cast in the uncomfortable      role of villains of the piece.\r\n       There should be a way out of this maze to allow all the\r\n   parties involved to emerge with their dignity intact.

The\r\n. lecturers are alternately being cajoled into a February date\r\n   for undisclosed pay rises or intimidated into signing so-called\r\n   return-to-work      documents.\r\n       The university staff, for their part, are sceptical that\r\n   anything concrete will come from the Government             side. They\r\n   are asking for more than vague promises: They want\r\n   something on the table. Now.\r\n       It would not seem an unreasonable        request. Whereas there\r\n . is no doubt that the Government         has a good reason for\r\n   sticking to its own deadline, it could be more open about the\r\n   reasons.
