In some cases,the appearance\r\n and performance of the fake products\r\n may be so close to the real thing that\r\n you would never suspect you had been\r\n duped. Forewarned is forearmed, so\r\n read about the operations of copycat\r\nmanufacturers in our main story this\r\nweek, how they dupe consumers, and\r\nthe economic impact of their illegal\r\noperations.\r\n    Have you ever wondered why it is\r\nthat women are rarely, if ever, sent to\r\nthe battlefront, or why men are more\r\nprone to violence than women? Join\r\n0yunga Pala as he explores the\r\ninteresting theory that the potential for\r\naggression is biological, rather than\r\ncultural. Who knows, it might help\r\nshed some light on why Kenya has\r\nmore than its fair share of wife-\r\nbeaters.\r\n    Our fiction piece could easily fit into\r\nJeffery Archer's short story collection,\r\nA Twist in the Tale,and makes\r\ncompelling reading. This, plus an\r\nexciting menu of entertainment stories,\r\npuzzles and feature stories should help\r\nusher in your weekend in style. Have a\r\npeaceful one.\r\nBetty\r\n Weekend                                                          Fa e or rea \u2022                                                                                                   \u2022\r\nEditorial Director: Wangethi Mwangi\r\nManaging Editor: Lucy Oriang'                                     the choice is yours!\r\nEditor: Betty Muriuki\r\nSub-Editor: Judy Ogecha\r\nArt Director: Kamau Wanyoike\r\nChief Graphic Designer: Edward Mwasi\r\nDesigners: Elijah Muli, Mejumaa Mbaruku\r\nStaff Writers: Franklin Awori, Joe Ombuor,                        Kenya is struggling to turn the tide on the booming trade in counterfeit\r\nPeter Kimani, Elly Wamari\r\nCorrespondents: Clay Muganda, Adhyambo                            products.
