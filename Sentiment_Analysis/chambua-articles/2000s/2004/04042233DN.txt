The egg is then artificially stimulated, causing the egg .\r\n         to develop in a way similar to an embryo fertilized by sperm.\r\n         Scientists envision extracting stem cells - which have the potential\r\n         to turn into every type of cell in the human body - from the Cloned\r\n         embryo so that they would be a perfect transplant match for the\r\n         patient.\r\n         \"This will create totally new opportunities to begin to understand\r\n         disease. To begin to test new drugs and to research disease in totally\r\n         new ways,\" Wilmut told SBC ..                                   _._\r\n         A South Korean-led team reporred iil February the world's first suc-\r\n       , cessful cloning of a human embryo and the culling of stem cells from\r\n         it. Britain legalized therapeutic cloning in 2001, becoming the first\r\n         country in the world to do so. The move allowed scientists to create\r\n         cloned embryos only for purposes of extracting stem cells for medi-\r\n         cal research. The extraction, which is done when the embryo is a few\r\n         days old, means the clones cannot develop into ~abies.\r\n            USA EDUCATIONAL ADYBiNG\r\n           AUllIEII11C                          T,; ,\r\n          ~!'.\"lhelMSca~\"\"\"\"\r\n            Wt \u2022\u2022 loc3II!dan Ihe w .\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022.\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022.\u2022\u2022\r\n                               Spm........, ............., \u2022\u2022\r\n           .WI \u2022\u2022 apen:8am..-\r\n                        8am..- I\u2022\u2022\u2022.\r\n                                   FriIIIr~ '\r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \u2022\r\n                                                                                       ,\r\n                                                                                       ,\r\n                                                                                       ,\r\n                                                                                       ,\r\n                                                                                       ,\r\n                                                                                       i\r\n                                                                                       I                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ,\r\n                                                                                       '--------------------------   ------------   --------   ---   \u2022. ---   - --------   -------.--   \u2022..-.- .\u2022.--------------   \u2022.--.-------   \u2022. ---   .\u2022.,.\u2022.--- .\u2022.\u2022\u2022\u2022..\u2022. --.----.-.---   ------------   -_ \u2022. ---   --   --~   -   .J\r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ,\r\nPage \f\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------Trial Version-----------------------\r\n\r\nConvert PDF to Text Desktop Software.\r\n\r\nCopyright Convertpdftotext.net 2014.\r\n\r\nTo remove these lines, please activate your software from http://www.convertpdftotext.net/buynow.htm\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------"}
