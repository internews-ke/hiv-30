Just who is fooling who?

  ago, the public have been treated to a comedy of errors as,
  those in authority seek to protect their skins.
     At first it was a series of denials, then a faint admittance
  and then several muddled responses. All of these have served
  to ingrain it in the public's mind that some people in the
  Government were intent on abetting graft.
     Even so, the latest drama - starring Finance minister
  David Mwiraria and the youthful Government           spokesman
  Alfred Mutua - pushes the scandal to ridiculous levels.
     Dr Mutua is certainly a rookie in terms of Government
  business and has the disadvantage of working in an office
  that has never existed, which means there is no institutional
  memory to bank on.
     lt is he who last week triggered the latest round of
  melodrama when he announced that the unidentified
  business operatives behind Anglo Leasing had paid back to
  the Treasury some Sh4.5 billion, which he later scaled down
  to Sh461 million.
     But no sooner had he said so than minister Mwiraria took
  to the podium to trash that information. He said the
  Government      had received only Sh91 million from Anglo                                                                  OUR HISTORICAL HERITAGE 0 ZARINA PATEL

     All these things raise serious questions. The first is: Does                               Uhuru: Asians played crucial role
  Dr Mutua know something that Mr Mwiraria does not?
  Whom should we believe? Why should two members of the
  same Government speak different language on a subject that                                                                                                                                                                                         r
