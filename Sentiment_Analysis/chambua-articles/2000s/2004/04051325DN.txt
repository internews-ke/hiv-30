One of them, located along Moi Avenue says\r\nthey sell an average of 50 packets in a day during these peak periods.\r\n   \"The trend is worrying. If the pills are not being used as an emer-\r\ngency contraceptive, the young girls' immature genital tract risks\r\nbeing disturbed,\" says Dr Irene Gathinji, a reproductive health\r\nexpert.\r\n   What emerges from these observations is that young men and girls\r\n- of more than average education - are engaging in unprotected sex\r\nwith full knowledge of the dangers of HIV and other sexually trans-\r\nmitted infections. This is especially so as recent statistics show that\r\ngirls have a higher HIV infection rate \u00b7than anybody else in the\r\n                                              population.\r\n                                                 Several pharmacies we\r\n                                              tomers range from school\r\n Even preteens                                spoke to say their cus-\r\n are knowingly                                gifls to university stu-\r\n                                              dents and are aged\r\n                   \u2022         \u2022                between ages 14 and 30.\r\n                                              Men also buy the pills in\r\n                                              some cases, presumably\r\n engag~ng\r\n        ~n\r\n                                              for their girlfriends.\r\n risky sex                                       Says one pharmacy\r\n                                              attendant: \"If you try to\r\n                                              caution them on overuse,\r\nthey will angrily tell you they know what they are doing.\"\r\n   The 'Morning After' pill is a multiple dose emergency contracep-\r\ntive designed to prevent conception through immobilising of the\r\nsperm, stopping the implantation of the embryo if fertilization has\r\noccurred, or suppressing a hormone known as the leutenising hor-\r\nmone that triggers ovulation.\r\n   The pill is taken within 72 hours from the time of having unpro-\r\ntected sex, with the first and second pills being taken at an interval of.\r\n12 hours.\r\n   It is not effective if a woman is pregnant and cannot be used to\r\nterminate a pregnancy that has taken rodt. The pills' prices locally\r\nrange from Sh 60 to Sh 120\r\n   Although the pills are supposed to be used for emergency purposes\r\nand at most twice a month, the teens are said to be using them like\r\nchocolate.\r\n   The current regular usage is against the manufacturers' recommen-\r\ndation that the pills should not be used repetitively. However, there                                                                                                                                                           Photo/AP\r\nseems to be no way to enforce this, particularly in countries where the            Maratal, left and Serolibi, enjoy their morning feed at the Nai.robi Animal'Orphanage                  on Wednesday.
