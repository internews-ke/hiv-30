TERRORISM

KENYA GETS FLAK OVER STAND ON US

The Kenya government has come under
criticism for backing America in the war
against international terrorism without
consulting the public.
Speakers at a public forum called to
discuss Kenya's position in the war took
issue with President Moi offering
logistical support without seeking
Parliament or public approval.
Leading the onslaught, clergyman Dr
Timothy Njoya said IS:enyan leaders
would indulge the country in a warfare
the public could little understand.
"Even President
George Bush
turned to the
Congress for
approval and for
budgetary
allocations to
fight terrorism".
Kenyan
officials have committed the
government to full support for the
US-led war on terrorism.
The talkshow was organised by the
Centre for Conflict Research at a
Nairobi hotel on Friday evening. Other
panellists were the centre's director
Makumi Mwagiru, African Women's
Development and Communication
Network executive director Lynn
Wanyeki, and Muslims Consultative
Council director Abdulrahman Wandati.
Dr Njoya fired off the debaie: "The
US is waging a crusade for the greatness
of its capital fundamentalism. We
cannot go on a crusade or jihad for the
greatness of our poverty."
Citing the historical events, Dr Njoya
said Africans involved in various world
wars were always abandoned by the
Europeans as soon as victory was
achieved.
"British colonialists branded
freedom fighter Dedan Kimathi a
terrorist and assassinated him.
Similarly, Jomo Kenyatta and Nelson
Mandela were named terrorists and
imprisoned."
The cleric said Kenya was not a
direct target by terrorists but a victim
of war between fundamentalists. He
said the looming war would divert the
country from the struggle for
democracy, the fight against Aids and
poverty, "which pose a more serious
threat to Africa than global terrorism".
The show was attended by Muslim
leaders, including Supreme Council of
Kenya Muslims secretary-general
Sheik Ahmad Khalif Muhammad and
a number of American citizens in
Kenya.
One participant said the Arabs and
Europeans had proved insensitive to
Africa's needs, "even after subjecting
the continent to great acts of terrorism
through slave trade and colonialism".
Dr Mwagiru said Kenya could offer
legal and diplomatic support in the war
but opposed any military involvement.
"We lack the resources and capacity to
engage in military intervention," he
added. "Involvement in this war
should be guided by our own national
interests and not what is defined by the
US or any other nation."
Ms Wanyeki urged Parliament to
initiate public debate on the issue and
to develop a collective and principled
foreign policy.
She said Kenya, having suffered a
terrorist attack in 1998, could assist the
US Federal Bureau of Investigations,
"but allowing America the use of our
military bases in a campaign against
Afghanistan will not end terrorism".
