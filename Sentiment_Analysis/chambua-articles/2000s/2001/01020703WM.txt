{"text": "\ufeffDAILY NATION, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 2001\r\n\r\nDELAY RECOMMENDED IN AIDS TREATMENT\r\n\r\nCHICAGO, TUESDAY\r\nNew guidelines for the treatment\r\nof the human immunodeficiency\r\nvirus released here\r\nthis week advise doctors to\r\nbegin anti-viral. therapy at a\r\nlater stage than previously\r\nrecommended.\r\nUnder the recommendations\r\nput forward by the National\r\nInstitutes of Health (NIH),\r\nreleased during the 8th Annual\r\nRetrovirus Conference, the\r\ntreatment should not begin\r\nuntil the total count of CD-4\r\nor T cells in the body's\r\nimmune system falls below\r\n350 per cubic millimetre of\r\nblood. In the past, treatment\r\nwas recommended when the\r\ncount was 500 per cubic\r\nmillimetre.\r\nExperts said the recommendations\r\nfor a delayed start were\r\nan acknowledgement of the\r\nserious side effects of the treatment\r\nwhich include toxicity to\r\nthe liver and pancreas and elevated\r\ncholesterol in the blood.\r\nHowever, the NIH noted\r\nthat for patients whose CD-4\r\ncell count is higher than 350\r\nper cubic millimetre of blood,\r\ntreatment may still be considered\r\nif the level of HIV in the\r\nbloodstream is 30,000 viruses\r\nper millimetre of blood using\r\nDNA testing. Previously, the\r\nlimit was 10,000 viruses per\r\nmillimetre.\r\nThe'updated guidelines \"recognise\r\nthat we do not yet have\r\nthe data we need to make definitive\r\nrecommendations about\r\nthe optimal time to start treatment,\"\r\nsaid one of the authors,\r\nJohn Bartlett, chief of the division\r\nof infectious diseases at\r\nthe Johns Hopkins University\r\nMedical Center in Baltimore,\r\nMaryland.\r\n\"We highlight the uncertainty,\r\nallow for flexibility, encourage\r\nan individualised approach\r\nto treatment, and, aphe same\r\ntime, trY to' provid~.gtmt~ce;'\r\nhe added. \r\nThe g~ldelines<aJ.strlincirPorate\r\ntwo new treatments for\r\nHIV infection which come\r\n\"strongly recommended\" - the\r\nprotease inhibitor Kaletra, a coformulation\r\nof ritonavir and\r\nlopinavir and the combination\r\nofritonavir and indinavir.\r\nFinally, the authors of the\r\nreport stressed the importance\r\nof sticking to the anti-viral\r\ntreatment regimen that must be\r\nfollowed for the rest of the\r\npatient's life.\r\n\"Extraordinarily high rates of\r\nadherence to an antiviral drug\r\nregimen are necessary to maintain\r\ncontrol over HIV replication,\"\r\nBartlett said.\r\nSome 3,000 researchers and\r\ndoctors are attending the fourday\r\nconference on Aids that\r\nopened on Sunday.
