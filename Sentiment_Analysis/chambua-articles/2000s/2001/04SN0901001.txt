Public celebrations and night
functions are to blame for the
high incidence of HIV /Aids in
the Coast Province, a group, of
Imams has said. '
The Council of Imams and
Preachers of Kenya also said it
was worried about the growing
number of infected
schoolchildren.
"We, religious leaders are
ready to work with the government
to help curb this disease
which has claimed many lives,"
said Amir Khamis Banda, the
association's South Coast
chairman.
He said the only way out was
to remain faithful to spouses or
to abstain from sex.
He announced plans to hold a
baraza in Tiwi Location,
Kwale District, to educate local
residents on Aids.
"Everyone will be welcome.
We expect Coast MPs, DOs,
DCs and Imams to attend. We
will educate the people about
, the dangers of this disease," ,he
said.
They Imams complained that
Coast PC Samuel Limo was not
taking .the Aids issue as seriously
as his Nyanza counterpart,
Mr Peter Raburu.
Aids, the council said,' was
robbing the country of its future
leaders ,and was burdening the
economy.
In Homa Bay, local DC 1.
Mbaruga yesterday urged
anthropologists to get actively
involved in the campaign
against HIV/ Aids.
Mr Mbaruga said social scientists
were better placed to
ignite behaviour change over
sexuality than medical personnel
or provincial administrators.
"It is absurd tQat the level of
awareness about the disease
stands at 90 per cent while the
cha~ge in behaviour is so dismal
that soon we shall start
counting those who are HIVnegative,"
the DC said.
He was addressing Maendeleo
ya Wanawake organisation
officials from Homa Bay
District who paid him a courtesy
call.
Organisation leader Okello
Nyang'isa presented the DC
with 17 radios to be presented
to women groups in the distdct.
The radios are a donation from
tht: HIV /Aids Prevention and
Care.
The administrator defended
the use of condoms saying it
was effective in the prevention
of sexually transmitted
infections.
"The war against Aids is
bound to fail unless the rural
woman is equipped with information
about the dangers of the
disease," she said.
Mrs Nyangisa requested the
Kenya Broadcasting Corporation
to air programmes about
HIV /Aids on TV and radio after
2 pm when most women have
finished their work. She said
her organisation would provide
audio-visual tapes on HIV/Aids
to individuals and women's
groups to enhance their knowledge
on the disease.
