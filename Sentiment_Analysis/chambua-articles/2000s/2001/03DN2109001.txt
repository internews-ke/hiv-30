REPORT ON AIDS SPARK DEBATE

By Nation reporter
Kenya Ports Authority went public
about the effects of Aids on its
workforce as a way of fighting
.he killer disease, the corporation
said yesterday.
At the same time, a number of
workers yesterday called the Nation
expressing shock about the
high number of KPA workers
infected with HIV, as reported
yesterday.
A KPA official, Mr B.O. Osero,
said that many companies had
shied away from disclosing the
damage being caused by the disease.
He said that the 17.5 per cent
infection figure given by his company
secretary, Mr George Dulu,
on Tuesday, included KPA workers
and their dependants.
He said the actual number of
people infected was about 2,000,
out of 22,153 workers and
dependants.
Mr Dulu's statement was supported
by KPA workers who
called the Nation in Mombasa.
Some of the callers challenged
other major organisations to
declare the extent of HIV infection
in their firms.
One caller, who said he was a
head of department, said the revelation
would help change sexual
behaviour, the main cause of HIV
infection.
"Since the story hit the headlines
today, HIV and Aids has
been the subject of discussion in
almost all KPA offices," he said.
Another caller took issue with
the Nation for reporting only on
KPA. "Why only us? Why don't
you report on other corporations
in the country?" asked the caller.
But another worker said it was
important for workers to know the
extent of the spread of the
disease.
