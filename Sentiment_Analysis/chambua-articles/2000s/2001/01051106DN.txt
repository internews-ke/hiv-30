The 1989\r\n Hillsborough     Stadium stampede,        which killed 95 people\r\nduring an English FA Cup final between Liverpool                  and\r\nNottingham       Forest, and the Heysel Stadium riots, which\r\nresulted in 39 deaths in 1985, are still marked as dark events\r\n in the European game. The 1985 incident forced a five-year\r\nban on English teams from European competition.\r\n    An analysis of stadium calamities since the 1960s indi-\r\n cates that they are fairly distributed       throughout    the world\r\n where soccer is the major spectator sport.\r\n    But there is one striking factor about the soccer deaths in                                                                                                                                                               ,\r\n African stadiums: police reaction to riots or even minor\r\n disturbances.\r\n    Here, in Kenya, we have had regular crowd disturbances\r\n during both domestic and international          matches. But indis-\r\n criminate firing of teargas by officers not trained in crowd\r\n control could have been a recipe for disaster, especially in a          COMMENTARY\r\n packed stadium where there is no easy exit. The saving\r\n grace during two recent Premier League incidents when\r\n riots erupted was that the crowds were easily contained.\r\n    Harare, Lubumbashi,        Johannesburg      and Accra should        Why the rich ought to\r\nserve as warnings.        The Kenya Football         Federation,   the\r\npolice, the municipal authorities,       stadium management       and\r\nclubs must now put their heads together and work out strate-\r\ngies for more effective stewardship during major games and\r\nfor efficient crowd control in case trouble breaks out.                  make govt end poverty\r\n    There might be some lessons from Europe where meas-\r\nures aimed at forestalling      fan violence are worked out well\r\nahead of any big game.
