PRAYER FOR VICTIMS OF AIDS
By SUNDAY NATION Correspondent

The Kenya Coalition for Access
to Essential Medicines has called
for a nationwide minute’s silence
and prayer at 10 am tomorrow for
those infected with HIV.
The coalition wants the Parlia
ment and pharmaceutical compa
nies to facilitate availability of
cheap Aids drugs.
The prayer, coming a day
before Parliament resumes, will
also commemorate thousands of
Kenyans who have succumbed to
the disease.
The coalition said this was part
of a “countdown campaign to the
debating of the Industrial Prop
erty Bill 200.”
The Bill, if passed, would res
ulate patent protection. “The Bill
should also provide inlernation
ally recognised safeguards such
as compulsory licensing and par
allel importation of essential med
icines, including generics.
The campaign includes mock
obituaries in the main newspapers
for the 700 Kenyans whom the
coalition says die of Aids every
day.
Activists are collecting signa
tures from the public to pressure
the pharmaceutical industry and
legislators to allow for “a patient
friendly Bill”.
However, it still not clear
when the Industrial Property Bill
will be debated in Parliament.
Mwea MP Alfred Nderitu said
it was not slated for House busi
ness yet.
“We are not aware right now.
When Parliament resumes, we
will go straight into the Budget.
Unless the Government pushes
for the Bill to be discussed early,
I don’t see it coming up soon”.
The MP said the Opposition
could bring up the mattcr but ulti
mately it was the Government’s
responsibility to slot it into the
timetable.
“The Government is dragging
its feet on this Bill. My experi
ence is thai each time the Opposi
tion plans a Bill that enjoys wide
public support, the Government
will crowd the timetable with
other things. It is likely to happen
again”.
Said Mr Nderitu: “The Gov
ernment is dragging its feet
because a lot of its officials have
vested interests in everything,
including the pharmaceuticals.
Some of them are the importers of
the expensive drugs.
“It is third parties making the
drugs that expensive. Sorne polii.i
C ¡ans or people connected with
them want a cut. (n the end, they
arc cutting the flesh of the dead.
They want this scourge to last as
long as possible so they can make
a killing.” The MP added: “The
guys making money out of this
scourge are the same ones making
laws in Parliament”.


KNECS TOUGH LINE ON EXAM CHEATING

By DENNIS ONYANGO
The Kenya National Examina
tions Council will continue to
withhold or cancel results of
schools and candidates suspected
to have cheated in national
examinations.
The Council Secretary, Mr
Juma Mwachihi, said the exams
body would also remove the cul
prits from the roll of approved
examination centres and even bar
them from entry to future exami
nations depending on the degree
of misconduct.
In a speech at the Precious
Illood Girls’ Secondary School,
Riruta, Nairobi, during the Par
ents’ Day, Mr Mwachihi said the
council would use its discretion
to disqualify candidates at a cen
tre that does not follow
regulations.
“cheating in examinations
can, ii undetected and unpun
ished, threaten the very core of an
examinations body. If candidates
who cheat get certificates, they
undermine one of the main func
tions of examinations, which is to
grade candidates according to
their abilities.”
The Kenya National Examina
tions Act, he said, gives the coun
cil powers to take drastic meas
ures to safeguard the reputation
of national exams.
Cheating “can undermine the
values of an honest candidate if it
appeared that dishonest candi
dates were the ones who were
being allocated places on the
basis of grades attained through
cheating,”
The KNEC boss attributed the
increased cases of cheating to
stiff competition for places and
jobs, poor preparation by candi
dates and poor supervision during
examinations. He also blamed
headteachers and their staff, say
ing they play a role in cheating.
“We would all like to have
irregularity-free examinations
and I have every reason to
believe this is possible.”
The council does not enjoy
cancelling results, he said. It is
‘very painful” for one to spend
time and resources in school for
four years only to cheat in exams
and lose results.
Early this year, more than
2,000 candidates had their results
cancelled, sparking protests from
Members of Parliameju and the
public.
The Government appointed a
committee to look into the cir
cumstances that led to the
cancellations.
This week, Mr Mwachihi said
the council and the Ministry of
Education would ensure “all those
who abet this evil activity are
punished because the policy is to
stamp out examination irregulari
ties at all costs.”
The secretary, who was the
chief guest, said the Ministry of
Education has formulated guide
lines to allow girls who drop Out
of school because of pregnancy to
resume learning after they deliver.
Despite the ministry’s policy,
the secretary said the fool-proof
option for girls is to “say No to
premarital sex.”
He said Aids was ravaging
schools and disclosed that blood
tests conducted in one girls’
school found 60 per cent of them
HIV.positive.
He urged Precious Blood
School to expand and admit more
students.
He suggested that the school
relocate to a new site to allow for
expansion. . :
He praised the school’s per
formance in national examina
tions. Last year, more than 50 per
Cent of the candidates attained
grade A minus or better in
Mathematics.
“It is a clear proof that this
subject is not insurmCuntable as
many schools have cotne to erro
neously believe,” he said.
