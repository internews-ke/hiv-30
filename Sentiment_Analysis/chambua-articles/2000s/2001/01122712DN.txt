We are\r\nready to work with some of our col-\r\nleagues. This country is so deeply\r\ndivided right now that a coalition would\r\nbe the first step towards healing,\" Mr\r\nMazoka told Reuters in an interview.\r\n   Zambia has become increasingly\r\ndivided along ethnic lines since outgo-\r\ning President Frederick Chiluba came\r\nto power in 1991. Critics say President\r\nChiluba gave key government positions\r\nto members of the northern Bemba-\r\nspeaking groups, his constituency, and\r\nignored other tribes.\r\n   An opinion poll showed this week\r\nthat Mr Mazoka held a slim lead over\r\nrivals Levy Patrick Mwanawasa of the\r\nruling Movement          for Multiparty\r\nDemocracy (MMD) and former Vice\r\nPresident Christon Tembo, leader of\r\nthe opposition Forum for Democracy\r\nand Development (FDD), in a presi-\r\ndential race that has 11 candidates but\r\nno clear front-runner.\r\n   However, the poll also showed that it\r\nwould be difficult for any party to win\r\none-third of the 150 elected seats in\r\nparliament, making a coalition govern-\r\nment likely.\r\n   Mr Mazoka's chances in Thursday's\r\npresidential and parliamentary elec-\r\ntions improved last week after he\r\nreceived an unexpected endorsement\r\nfrom founding President          Kenneth\r\nKaunda, who called him \"a man of\r\nintegrity    and a good economic\r\nmanager\".\r\n   Mr Kaunda was defeated at the bal-       Supporters of the United Party for National Development (UPND) hold posters of presidential candidate Anderson Mazoka at a rally in Lusaka on\r\nlot box in 1991 by Mr Chiluba, who is\r\ndue to retire after serving two five-year   Tuesday as right, ruling party candidate Levy Mwanawasa's supporters display his poster.
