The government has set aside
Sh502 million in the Budget for
the fight against Aids.
Finance Minister Chris Okemo
made the announcement during
the official opening of a regional
Aids meeting in Nairobi 'yesterday.
He said Sh7.5 million out of
the funds allocated would be utilised
in the establishment of Aids
control units in all ministries.
"The objective is to make
available additional resources to
support initiatives aimed at
reducing the HIV prevalence rate,
increasing access to care and support
to those infected and affected
by the pandemic and strengthening
the capacity at national, district
and community levels to positively
respond to the scourge," he
said.
He added: "However, by no
means can these resources be cons'idered
enough, given the high
prevalence rate of the pandemic
and the devastating effects it has
on the economy."
At the same time, the government,
the minister added, was
already seeking an additional $50
million (about Sh3.7 billion) from
the World Bank to support and
expand multi-sectoral response
countrywide.
The two-day conference, being
held at Safari Park Hotel, was
officially opened by Public
Health Minister, Prof Sam
Ongeri.
It assembles 14 Finance and
Health ministers from Commonwealth
countries in East, Central
and Southern Africa.
Representatives from UN
agencies as well as World Bank
country director Harold Wackman,
also attended.
The meeting is organised by
the Arusha-based Commonwealth
Regional Health Community
Secretariat.
