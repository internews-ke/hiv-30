A good showing
for Kenya but ...
  Kenyan athletes did a splendid job in the Sydney Olympics,
  which ended yesterday.      Having won six medals, they were
 ranked only second to Ethiopia among African countries.
    I The two gold medallists -   Reuben Kosgei and Noah Ngeny
 T lifted the spirits of many J(enyans, especially at this time
 \fhen we all crave something positive to distract us from the
country's social and economic problems.
   : Equally commendable were silver medal winners Paul Tergat,
Wilson Boit and Eric Wainaina. Also finishing among the top
tl;iree were Bernard Lagat and Joyce Chepchumba, who won
   ronze.
   : While the women's volleyball team failed to make an impres-
  ion, they competed in the true Olympics spirit of honour. We
  ay congratulatIOns.
  ; But could Kenya have done better? Reputed to be among
   pme of the best middle and distance runners in the world, our
 thletes had plenty of opportunities in the 1988 Seoul Olympics
 o surpass their performance but bungled up everything.
  I The medallists in Sydney did not win by fluke. They all shared
 omething in common - right focus, serious preparations and
 ne determination to do well in the games.
  : Their Olympic dream started four years ago. In Ngeny's own
 \,ords, he skipped the money-spinning Grand Prix circuit to con-
 ¢ntrate on the Olympics.
 : Prior to the games, Tergat ran only four races, including the           COMMENTARY
tials, while Wainaina last took part in a marathon race in Janu-
ry.
 : This goes to show that success comes through sacrifice and
 romoter's dream to have a rematch between Ngeny and Hicham
Ianning. These medallists are now hot properties for athletic              Snap out of this denial
