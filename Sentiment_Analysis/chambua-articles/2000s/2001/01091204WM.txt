{"text": "\ufeffDaily Nation/ Wednesday, September 12, 2001\r\nRAPE AND TERROR RULE OVER THE LAND\r\n\r\nBY JOE OMBUOR\r\n\r\nThe austere wind spirals the dust in tall,\r\ngrotesque cyclones, sending afternoon\r\nstrollers scurrying for safety behind\r\nstained, wooden kiosks. As the storm\r\nsubsides, loud speakers cackle to life atop towering\r\nminarets. Across the main road running through\r\ntown, a bell tolls from the nearby Catholic church.\r\nIt is worship time in Isiolo town, 300 kilometres\r\nnorth of Nairobi. But the elaborate religious ambience\r\nbelies the harsh reality of the lives of an estimated\r\n120,000 people in Kenya's war-torn frontier\r\ntown.\r\nThe town's lone street teems with begging children\r\nby day and gun-totting rapists and murderers\r\nby night.\r\nMost of the children are orphans of Aids. Some\r\nof them are the offspring of the bandits, whose\r\nperennial violence has visited poverty and frustration\r\non pastoral family life and displaced thousands\r\nof people.\r\nThe poverty and desolation have forced many\r\nyoung girls and women out of their homes into the\r\nstreets, where they peddle their flesh for a living.\r\nGoing by the revelry in the numerous bars, night\r\nclubs and lodges, prostitution is a casual business\r\nhere.\r\nIn the desert town women in the world's oldest\r\nprofession are indulgently\r\nreferred to as 'Coca Cola',\r\n'Night Generation' and\r\n'Mitumba'. Night Generation\r\nare girls aged between 9\r\nand 13; Coca Cola are those\r\nin the 13-19 age bracket,\r\nwhile mitumba refer to the\r\nolder, more sophisticated\r\nlot.\r\nThe fact that most women are driven into the\r\ntrade by despair and poverty is clear from the case\r\nof the typical, married woman. Let's call her Amina.\r\nAt midnight, she is in a bar, flirting with intent,\r\na seven-month-old pregnancy cleverly concealed\r\nbeneath her buibui.\r\n\"I have been doing this for a week now to raise\r\nfare to return to my husband in Nyeri, but have\r\nmanaged to save only Sh300,\" she opens up after a\r\nlittle cajoling.\r\nAmina, who claims to be 18, says she returned\r\nhome to her parents after a misunderstanding with\r\nher husband of one year. \"But they threw me out\r\nwithout any money. I have no option but to return\r\nto my husband with my problems unsolved,\" she\r\nsays. \"In the meantime, I have to survive.\" If the\r\nstory of Amina's twilight life is shocking, listening\r\nto the woes of rape victims is horrifying. An alarming\r\nwave of rape has devastated many families in\r\nthe area, leaving in its wake individuals deprived\r\nof any claim to dignity or self-worth. Many parents\r\nhave had to relocate their grown-up children for\r\nfear of being humiliated by the beastly rapists.\r\n\"They stage robbery raids and at gun point,\r\nforce boys into sex with their mothers, and fathers\r\nwith their daughters. Then they rape and sodomise\r\ntheir victims,\" says Halima Zuberi, a widowed\r\nmother of four.\r\nHalima sent her elder children, one aged 26 and\r\nthe other 22, to live with relatives in Meru and\r\nMombasa. She has rented cheap accommodation\r\nin the neighbourhood for the younger ones.\r\nZainab Abdullahi has two children aged nine\r\nand 21. The older one lives in a rented house.\r\n\"Nothing is more dehumanising than being\r\nforced into sex with your children or getting raped\r\nas they watch, as often happens here. In some families,\r\nfathers have deserted their homes in shame,\r\nleaving their families to founder in poverty.\"\r\nThe rapists are not scared of contracting HIV\r\nand, either out of ignorance or sheer malice, use\r\ncrude polythene paper bags instead of condoms.\r\nAgnes AliIa, 40, lost her husband to Aids and\r\nwas sickly when she was attacked. She narrates\r\nhow she pleaded with a frenzied gang not to touch\r\nher. It was all in vain. \"I told them I was HIV\r\npositive, but they would not listen. They proceeded\r\nto rape me in turns. As if that was not enough, they\r\nsodomised my 12-year-old son. He is now HIV\r\npositive,\" she moans.\r\nFor Irene Muthoni, who has been down with\r\nAids for three years, the pain of being raped\r\ntogether with two of her daughters turned into permanent\r\nagony when both girls succumbed to the\r\ndisease.\r\n\"I lost the will to live when they died. At one\r\npoint, I was determined to take my own life. I had\r\nalready bought rat poison for the purpose but was\r\nstopped in the nick of time,\" she says.\r\nMuthoni now lives with her two sons in perpetual\r\ndread of rapists in Isiolo's suburb of Kula\r\nMawe.\r\n\"I fear for the boys, who narrowly escaped sodomy\r\nduring the attack. I have committed them to\r\nGod,\" she says.\r\nSheikh Abdi Nassir of Isiolo's Jamia Mosque\r\nand the institution's administrator, Ahmed Abdi\r\nSet, blame the increased incidents of banditry on\r\nthe ready availability of guns.\r\nA growing disrespect for religious values, says\r\nSheikh Nassir, is responsible for promiscuity and\r\nviolence. \"Islam is against promiscuity and prostitution.\r\nThose engaging in the practice cannot be\r\nMuslims.\"\r\n\"We cannot blame those who get raped or sodomised,\r\nbut we condemn the culprits and wonder\r\nwhy the Government's security arm has not caught\r\nup with them,\" says Sheikh Nassir.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW AIDS IS CHANGING THE STRUCTURE OF FAMILIES\r\n\r\nJOE OMBUOR\r\nAchuka Ewoi is well into her 80s.\r\nOne would expect that, with her five\r\nsurviving children all grown up with\r\nfamilies of their own, she would now\r\nbe leaning back, enjoying her twilight years and\r\nbeing cared for. But today, Achuka is a mother\r\nall over again, raising five children aged between\r\nseven and 14 years.\r\nOne of these is her grandchild, Lekalio. His\r\nparents died from Aids-related illnesses, as did\r\nAchura's two other offspring.\r\nShe married early, and had eight children -\r\nsix boys and two girls. Frail and her face wrinkled,\r\nAchuka is today a widow with only five\r\nliving children.\r\n\"I know what a parent means to a child,\" she\r\nsays, speaking pensively about her return to\r\nmotherhood. \"I had to step in to fill that gap for\r\nLekalio. His brothers and sisters were adopted\r\nby my other children.\"\r\nShe was asked by Pepo la Tumaini Jangwani,\r\nan Isiolo-based HIV/Aids community programme,\r\nto play the role of mother to other\r\norphans.\r\nAt her shack in Kula Mawe, on the outskirts of\r\nIsiolo town, 14-year-old Lekalio and Emmanuel,\r\n11, have just returned home. They spent the day\r\nbegging in town and gleaning discarded foodstuffs\r\nat the market, an exercise referred to as\r\nkusanya, which means 'to collect'.\r\nThe other children are in school. Kusanya is\r\ndone in turns, and tomorrow Lekalio and\r\nEmmanuel will go to school, while two others go\r\nto town.\r\n\"I cook for the children. I am there for them\r\nwhen they are sad and when they are happy. I\r\noffer them comfort, re-assurance and advice. I\r\nnurse them when they fall sick, just as any caring\r\nmother would do,\" says Achuka.\r\nThe children and other youths in the community\r\nfondly refer to her as Ito (Turkana for\r\nmother), and she lives up to her name - $eeing\r\nto it that no child is unfairly heated in the home.\r\nAll five children use Ewoi as their surname.\r\n\"The common name helps them regard each\r\nother as brothers and sisters and saves them the\r\ntrauma of thinking about their dead patents,\"\r\nsays Achuka.\r\nHer age gives her an advantage in disGussing\r\nsexuality, and especially the danger of HIY/Aids.\r\n\"As a grandmother, I engage my children in open\r\ndiscussion on all matters affecting their lives\r\nwithout the inhibition of shame.\"\r\nAnd it is not just here that Aids has wrought\r\npain and anguish. Not far from Kula Mawe, in\r\nanother shack in Isiolo, lO-year-old Zablon\r\nMuatha struggles to look after his ailing mother,\r\nJoyce Nkuruguchu. He does all the household\r\nchores. The rest of the time is divided between\r\ngoing to school and kusanya.\r\nJoyce came to Isiolo from the neighbouring\r\nMeru District nearly a decade ago to look for\r\nwork. She soon found herself sucked into\r\nprostitution.\r\n\"I was still healthy and attractive, despite the\r\nfact that I had been married to a cruel and reckless\r\nhusband who drank all his money and beat\r\nme for eight years. He also sold off all our\r\nproperty.\"\r\nIn Isiolo, life was good. She had four \u00a2hildren\r\nfrom her failed marriage, while Muatha Wasborn\r\nin Isiolo. \"I had money and I quickly forgot the\r\nmisery of my married life.\"\r\nAbout three years ago, however, she started to\r\nget frequent bouts of illness. \"I've had diarrhoea,\r\ntyphoid, tuberculosis, skin complications - name\r\nit. I suffered paralysis and could hardly move my\r\nhands and legs until Pepo la Tumaini Jangwani\r\norganised drugs for me,\" she says."}
