  Make Aids drugs
  affordable to all
   It is right and proper that the government and all its partners
   in the fight against Aids should emphasise, as they have
   done so far, prevention rather than cure as the first line of
  defence against the human immunodeficiency virus.
      And yet, the debilitating effects of Aids on the population
  are increasingly becoming all too apparent. A great number
  of useful, active and youthful people infected with HIV are
  enfeebling the country's health institutions with demands on
  drugs and facilities to treat the myriad opportunistic infec-
  tions. In some areas, more than half the bedspaces in major
  hospitals are occupied by Aids patients.
      They cannot be turned away without treatment, and yet,
  there are other patients who need the health facilities, too.
  There is a continuing campaign to shift the strain visited on
  hospitals by Aids patients to homes where they can receive
  care among family, but even this approach has its
  limitations.

 would allow people to live longer, healthier lives. and con-
