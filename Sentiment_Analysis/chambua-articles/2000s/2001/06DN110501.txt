 Let soccer chiefs
 learn from Accra
 Recently, Africa has been hit by an epidemic of football
 stadium stampedes.
    The Wednesday       incident in Accra, in which 120 soccer
 fans perished, is just the latest in a series of stadium deaths
 in the past few months - in Johannesburg,          Lubumbashi    and
 Harare.
    Stadium     deaths   are common         worldwide.     The 1989
 Hillsborough     Stadium stampede,        which killed 95 people
during an English FA Cup final between Liverpool                  and
Nottingham       Forest, and the Heysel Stadium riots, which
resulted in 39 deaths in 1985, are still marked as dark events
 in the European game. The 1985 incident forced a five-year
ban on English teams from European competition.
    An analysis of stadium calamities since the 1960s indi-
 cates that they are fairly distributed       throughout    the world
 where soccer is the major spectator sport.
    But there is one striking factor about the soccer deaths in                                                                                                                                                               ,
