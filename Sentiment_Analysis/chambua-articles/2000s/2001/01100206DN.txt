{"text": " 6\r\n 'DAll Y\r\nNATION    Nairobi, Monday, October 2, 2000\r\nA good showing\r\nfor Kenya but ...\r\n  Kenyan athletes did a splendid job in the Sydney Olympics,\r\n  which ended yesterday.      Having won six medals, they were\r\n ranked only second to Ethiopia among African countries.\r\n    I The two gold medallists -   Reuben Kosgei and Noah Ngeny\r\n T lifted the spirits of many J(enyans, especially at this time\r\n \\fhen we all crave something positive to distract us from the\r\ncountry's social and economic problems.\r\n   : Equally commendable were silver medal winners Paul Tergat,\r\nWilson Boit and Eric Wainaina. Also finishing among the top\r\ntl;iree were Bernard Lagat and Joyce Chepchumba, who won\r\n   ronze.\r\n   : While the women's volleyball team failed to make an impres-\r\n  ion, they competed in the true Olympics spirit of honour. We\r\n  ay congratulatIOns.\r\n  ; But could Kenya have done better? Reputed to be among\r\n   pme of the best middle and distance runners in the world, our\r\n thletes had plenty of opportunities in the 1988 Seoul Olympics\r\n o surpass their performance but bungled up everything.\r\n  I The medallists in Sydney did not win by fluke. They all shared\r\n omething in common - right focus, serious preparations and\r\n ne determination to do well in the games.\r\n  : Their Olympic dream started four years ago. In Ngeny's own\r\n \\,ords, he skipped the money-spinning Grand Prix circuit to con-\r\n \u00a2ntrate on the Olympics.\r\n : Prior to the games, Tergat ran only four races, including the           COMMENTARY\r\ntials, while Wainaina last took part in a marathon race in Janu-\r\nry.\r\n : This goes to show that success comes through sacrifice and\r\n romoter's dream to have a rematch between Ngeny and Hicham\r\nIanning. These medallists are now hot properties for athletic              Snap out of this denial\r\n  eeting promoters   and they will soon recoup all earnings lost\r\n  hile preparing for the Olympics.
