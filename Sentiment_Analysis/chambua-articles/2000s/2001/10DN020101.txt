 Mkapa
 warns
 over
'Aids
        OAR ES SALAAM. Sunday
   Tanzania's President Benjamim
   Mkapa has urged Tanzanians to
   change their sexual behaviour in
   order to curb the spread of Aids
   in the new year.
      "How many of us have
   changed our behaviour, eschew-
   ing completely those ways of
   life that contribute to the spread
  of HIV?," President Mkapa
  asked in his New Year message
  broadcast late yesterday.
      "Has there been, in our com-
  munities and streets, a new
  awakening       and consciousness
  on the need to fight HIV?," he
  said.
      The latest official figures
  from December 1999 showed
  that 8,850 people were suffer-
  ing from full-blown Aids in
. Tanzania. Another 1.75 million
  people, almost six per cent of
  the country's population, were
  infected with the HIV virus,
  which causes the disease.
      An estimated 600,000 Tanza-
  nian children had lost one or
  both parents to Aids by the end
  of 1999, President Mkapa said.                                                                                                      ,}
      Fifty to 60 per cent of-beds in
  urban areas were occupied by
  Aids patients, he added. (AFP)        Supporters   of Ghanaian    opposition leader John Kufuor gather at his home celebrating his victory in a presidential         election as, right, Ghana's    new first couple,
