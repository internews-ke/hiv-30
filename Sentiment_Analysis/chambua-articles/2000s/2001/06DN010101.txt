           It is not only unconscionable for police officers to target
      journalists going about their duty. But it is also criminal for
      senior police officers to make good public threats to harm the
      very same citizens they have been employed to protect.
           What we saw when chaos broke out at the Mbo-i-Kamiti
      meeting last Saturday can hardly qualify to ,be part of the
      peace-keeping duties that Chief Inspector Musoso and his. tea~
      of officers were sent to perform. They were there to maIntaIn
      law and order. Instead, we saw the all-too-familiar face of
      thugs in uniform. So brazen have these criminals become that
      they do not even bother to hide their faces.
           Not only is it on record that an inspector identified as K!ilu
      threatened to kill Ms Dindi, but she WliStargeted for a beatIng
      by officers who pursued her through, a coffee plantation and
      threatened to flush her out of a farmhouse with teargas.
           And all this as violence reigned supreme among troubled
       shareholders. Indeed, the police appeared to have clearly set
      their sights on Ms Dindi and the Nation Media Group in
      particular.                         ....
           We at the Nation demand ImmedIate actl.Qn from Pohce
      Commissioner Philemon Abong'o. As citizens of this country,
      our reporters have every right. to pursue their duties without
      fear of attack by policemen or anyone else who has an axe to               NEWS ANALYSIS

           Indeed, this is not the first time that journalists have been
      assaulted. We have seen reporters and photographers kid-
       napped and whipped.          Others have had theIr equipment             Virginity testing' gets,
