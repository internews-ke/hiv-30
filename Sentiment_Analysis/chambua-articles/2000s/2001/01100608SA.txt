He proposed a \"partnership\" in .\r\n           Labour Party conference on Wednesday was\r\nwhich the West would provide more aid, write off debt, help\r\ndevelop infrastructures, encourage more foreign investment\r\nand open its markets to more African produce.\r\n   Africa would, in turn, promote greater democracy and good\r\ngovernance, uphold human rights, reduce corruption and\r\nresource mismanagement and begin on the road of setting up\r\nmodern commercial, legal and financial systems.\r\n   Nothing is new as such. Yet the British Prime Minister's is\r\nlikely to be the first since decolonisation half a century ago\r\nthat a major Western political movement has devoted\r\nsubstantial time at an annual convention to the continent.\r\n   It was an acknowledgment that, despite its troubles, Africa\r\ncannot be ignored and that the West, since much of Africa's\r\npresent woes have European colonial roots, must playa\r\ngreater role than hitherto in helping cultivate a more equal\r\nrelationship.\r\n   It was also a recognition that an Africa plagued with\r\npove:rty, disease; hunger and instability is a threat sooner or\r\nlater to global stability. One phrase in Mr Blair's speech\r\nperf1ectly illustrates the new thinking: Promote Africa's\r\n\"access to our markets so we can trade as freely as we are so\r\nfond of preaching\".
