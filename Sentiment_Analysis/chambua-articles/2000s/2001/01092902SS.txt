{"text": "\ufeffSaturday Nation September 29, 2001\r\nWE MUST NOW MOVE BEYOND MAKING PLEDGES\r\n\r\n\r\nBy NICHOLAS ALIPUI\r\n\r\nWorld Summit for Children in 1990, the world's leaders\r\nollowing its adoption by the United Nations in 1989, the\r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child has shaped inter-\r\nnational consensus on a new vision for children. At the\r\nmade a promise to promote and uphold the rights enshrined in the\r\nConvention. In this era of rights, we are no longer being asked to\r\npledge commitments to children but to fulfIll our obligations to\r\nthem according to the articles of the Convention.\r\nIn Kenya, the Convention is already inspiring and guiding\r\nnational policies, plans of action, legislation and other measures\r\naiming to promote child rights within the wider realm of human\r\nrights, including the rights of women. However, in a world of\r\nwidening disparities and growing poverty, children in Kenya are\r\nfalling rapidly behind and deserve special attention. To combat\r\nthis, we need to develop a national aspiration for children's well\r\nbeing which should guide all our efforts if we are to break the\r\ncycle of transmission of poverty from generation to generation.\r\nAdmittedly, many important improvements in lives of children\r\nand women in Kenya have occurred over the past several decades.\r\nThere has been a dramatic reduction in mortality and disability\r\nfrom polio and a zero-case record since 1987, reflecting the success\r\nof policies and programmes for children.\r\nOverall, however, Kenya has fallen short of the goals of the\r\nWorld Summit for Children, not because they were too ambitious\r\nor technically beyond reach, but largely because of insufficient\r\ninvestment. In absolute numbers, there are more children in\r\nschool than ever before but the fact is that almost 57 per cent of\r\nchildren of school going age are not attending school.\r\nRemarkably, there have been many dramatic declines in the\r\n\\ lives of children in the country in the last few years of the last\r\n\r\ncentury. The number of infants and children dying before their\r\n\r\nfirst and fifth birthdays has increased while maternal mortality\r\nrati.os have remained stagnant. This is compounded by the rapidly\r\nragmg HIV and Aids pandemic which currently claims the lives of\r\n\r\n78 Kenyan youth a day, and is devastating entire communities.\r\nAs such, Kenya today faces numerous challenges in both com-\r\npleting the. un?nished agenda of the last decade and addressing\r\nnew emergmg Issues.\r\nWhile the efforts needed to accelerate improvements in the\r\nlives of children in Kenya are within the reach of Kenyans them-\r\npoverty cannot be achieved by a single agency, ministry or by\r\nselves, it clear that the impetus we need to lift children out of\r\n\r\nThis is why Unicef is working with partners in government, in\r\ngovernment alone.\r\n\r\nthe private sector, with civil society and the media to help mobilise\r\n\r\na national movement for children as part of the Global Movement\r\nfor Children - a worldwide campaign to build a shared sense of\r\nresponsibility for the welfare and fulfIllment of the rights of every\r\nchild on earth ..\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we prepare for the UN Special Session on Children we ask\r\nevery Kenyan to stand up and be counted. In families, government\r\nor corporations we ask them to show the world that they care\r\n\r\n\r\nabout children and are willing to action to protect, defend and\r\nsecure their rights. In the words of the Global Movement Cam-\r\npaign slogan, we ask them to 'Say Yes for Children'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Nicholas Alipui is the Unicef Kenya Country Representative.\r\n\r\nThe UN Special Session on Children was postponed following\r\nthe terrorist attack in New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEALTH\r\n\r\nA plus for immunisation\r\n\r\n\r\nBy JULIANA OMALE\r\n\r\nIn the past decade, it was widely acknowl-\r\nedged that more effort was needed to make\r\ncertain development goals worthwhile for\r\nchildren.\r\ndefIciencies.\r\nIn health terms the impact for children con-\r\ntinues to be registered in disease prevention\r\nand control, and reductions in micronutrient\r\nGlobally, the mid-decade immunisation goal\r\nof 80 per cent coverage against diptheria, per-\r\ntussis, tetanus (DPT), measles, poliomyelitis\r\nand tuberculosis among children under one\r\nyear of age was achieved in 75 per cent of\r\ntargeted countries. Reported cases of polio-\r\nmyelitis declined from 23,000 in 1990 to 4,000\r\nin 1997. The Americas succeeded in eradicat-\r\ning the disease.\r\nIn Kenya, the last recorded polio case was in\r\n1994. UNICEF's Country Office Project\r\nOfficer, Health, Dr Agostino Munyiri, says\r\nKenya has been virtually polio free since\r\n1997\r\nBut this status is compromised by the pres-\r\nence of wild polio in neighbouring countries\r\nthat are ravaged by political and social insta-\r\nbility as well as constant cross-border human\r\ntraffic. Kenya can be given a clean bill of\r\nhealth only when the region eradicates wild\r\npolio strains. Hence the intensity of national\r\nimmunisation days since 1996.\r\nThese immunisation efforts achieved 90 per\r\ncent coverage in 2000, compared to 80 per\r\ncent in previous years.\r\nDr Munyiri says another recent development\r\n\r\nthat benefits the cause of Kenya's children is\r\n\r\nthe government's commitment to foot the\r\nvaccine procurement bill.\r\n\"For the past three years, the government has\r\n\r\npledged to pay five per cent of the annual\r\nchild vaccines budget, which stands at US$ 2\r\nmillion (about ShI56m).\"\r\nAlthough the country came close to 80 per\r\ncent immunisation coverage of the six main\r\nkillers of children under two years by 1990,\r\n\"We noticed that coverage for measles\r\neradicating measles is still a challenge.\r\n\r\ncent in 2000.\"\r\ndropped from 80 per cent in 1994 to 71 per\r\n\r\nDonor support to declined within the past\r\n\r\nfour years, but this may not be the reason for\r\nthe drop in coverage.\r\n\"The problem with the vaccination schedule\r\nfor measles is the six-month interval after the\r\n\r\nfInal DPT vaccination when the infant is 14\r\n\r\nweeks. Mothers seem to forget to return their\r\nchildren when they turn nine months, proba-\r\n\r\nbly due to communication        breakdowns\r\n\r\nbetween them and health-workers,\" says Dr\r\nMunyiri.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, two more vaccine schedules will\r\n\r\nbe introduced next month. There are Hepati-\r\n\r\ntis Band Haemophilus Influenza antigens.\r\nThe first protects against development of\r\n\r\nA health care worker administers anti-polio an\r\nThe debilitating disease has been yjrtually wi\r\n\r\nliver cancer while the latter safeguards chil-\r\ndren against pneumonia and meningitis,\r\nwhich accompany influenza.\r\n\r\nAlthough the vaccines are available, their\r\n\r\ncost has been too prohibitive for the national\r\nimmunisation programme. The antigens will\r\nbe combined with the DPT schedule.\r\n\r\nThe Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has\r\nchannelled     seed\r\nmoney to support\r\ndelivery,  through     In Kenya, the last reco\r\nthe Global Alliance\r\nfor Vaccines and       case was in 1994.

The cost butden is directly\r\nlinked to use of disposable injection packs.\r\n\r\nAlthough the health policy is comfortable\r\n\r\nwith use of sterilisers, these are no longer in\r\nvogue due to consumer pressure in the wake\r\nof HIV IAIDS onslaught.\r\n\r\n\"We have found that both clients and health\r\nI\r\n\r\nrded polio\r\n\r\nto 80 per\r\n\r\n\r\nrecorded for\r\n\r\n\r\nchildren\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworkers are uneasy about reusing needles and\r\nsyringes, even if the correct sterilising proce-\r\ndures are applied,\" says Dr Munyiri.\r\n\r\nDisposable packs are not ~IY expensive but\r\n\r\nthey pose an environmental and public health\r\nrisk.\r\n\r\nThe GA VI facilitates dis 'bution of non-\r\n\r\nrecyclable syringe packs        th the new vac-\r\ncines, but these cost six US cents each\r\n\r\n(Sh4.70). The cost is prohibitive on the\r\n\r\nnational immunisation progtamme.\r\n\r\nAll in all, vaccines for children are an equita-\r\nble intervention      which proportionately\r\nAn A wefeature.\r\nfavours the poor.           -"}
