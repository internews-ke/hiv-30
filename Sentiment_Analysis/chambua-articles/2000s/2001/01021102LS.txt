{"text": "\ufeffThe Sunday Nation. February 11,   2001.\r\n\r\nFrom CHRIS ERASMUS\r\nin CAPE TOWN\r\n\r\nSouth African Aids activist Nkosi Johnson born HIV-positive, at 12 years of age, has had the\r\ncourage and tenacity to be the longest surviving become a symbol of hope for people living with\r\nHIV and Aids around the world.Nkosi sprang to world prominence last year when he spoke.., eloquently and movingly, at the\r\nWorld Aids conference held in Durban, South Africa.\r\nSince then, his condition has deteriorated badly. Shortly before Christmas he collapsed and he has been in and out of consciousness, clinging to the fringes of life.\r\nEven though he has for weeks been at a low point, desperately ill and barely able to move, the power of his courage and commitment to the message of hope, which he has embodied, has been undiminished.\r\nWhile TV and sports stars last weekend celebrated his 12th birthday with his young school friends playing outside, Nkosi lay motionless in his bedroom in the Johannesburg suburb of Melville, not even able to clutch a stuffed toy tiger which lay alongside him. His tiny frame wracked with pain and desperately thin, it seemed impossible for Nkosi to live even another hour. But almost a week has dragged on by since then, and although there have been only intermittent and faint signs of improvement in his condition, he doggedly hangs on to the Inst threads of his young life.\r\nMost of the time he is semicomatose, but every now and then his eyes - made extra large by his shrunken face - open and follow the movements of his foster mother, Gail Johnson.\r\nach swallowed sip of liquidised fruit has E become something to celebrate. a small victory in the face of the inevitable.\r\nBut through it all, his courage shineslike the brightest of lights.\r\nHe has even managed a few times to raise a skeletal hand and take the hand of his adoptive mother for a few seconds.\r\n\"I have reassured him that I will cope and his mommy (who died of an Aids-related illness) is waiting for him. He has seen his relatives and out his ordeal, says\u00b7 she is at a loss to explain knows there is peace with them,\" Johnson told\r\nreporters last week .Even she, who has been with Nkosi through Nkosi's tenacious will to stay alive since}le collapsed more than a month ago.Doctors say they can do no more for him and Nkosi has not been able to speak more than a ~ ...\r\n\r\nweird or two since his collapse.\"He wakes up more often but does not speak any more.\" said Johnson ...\r\nHe has been lifted out of bed into a chair a few times but he cannot support his head or move on\r\nhis own. A full-time nurse is at his bedside, joined by volunteers, mostly close friends, and by Johnson\r\nwhen she can manage it. Exhausted by the ordeal, Johnson somehow finds time and strength to play\r\nhim soothing classical music. It may seem a sad and ultimately futile process, but each breath Nkosi manages to take\r\nagainst all the odds adds more momentum to his message, which is that there is hope and there is life, even in the face of a terrible and terminal illness.\r\n\r\nHe is unlikely to survive much longer in this encounter with the dreaded HIV invader that has\r\n\r\ndestroyed his immune system, but Nkosi's legac is certain to live on - and the power of that legacy is multiplied and extended with (each hou,each day he lives on ..It was his shining, happy face, filled With hop\r\nand promise, that stood out amidst the silly political wrangling that was the background to the firs Above, Ms Gail Johnson (right) Nkosi'sadoptive mother, hugs Nkosi'sgrandmother Ruth Nkosi during a birthday party in honour of Nkosi (pictured in\r\npainting), at his primary school in Johannesburg.
