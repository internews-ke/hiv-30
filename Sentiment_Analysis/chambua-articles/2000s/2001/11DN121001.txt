Experts say the condom is impermeable to the smallest sexually transmitted virus

F        try of Health's policy on condom
         use, health experts agree that the
question of safety of using the sheaths     4
will dominate discussions.
    Virtually the entire medical fraternity
is agreed that condoms, in the words of
an American panel which recently
examined their effectiveness "are highly
effective barriers to virus passage".
    According to the American panel,
which comprised the US Agency for
International     Development (USAid),
the Food and Drug Administration
 (FDA) the Centre for Disease Control
and Prevention          (CDC),     and the
National Institutes of Health (NIB),
when correctly used, condoms reduce
 the risk .of contracting HIV by as much
 as 85 per cent.
    What this means is that if the absolute
 risk of contracting HIV without a con-
 dom is one out of every 1,000 (which is
 the probability given by the World
 Health Organisation for a male who has
 one sexual encounter with an infected
 woman), using a condom further
 reduces this risk by 85 per cent.
     "The published data documenting
 effectiveness of the male condom to
 protect against STDs is strongest for
 HIV," the panel wrote in a report pub-
 lished in June.

  studies, consistent usage of the male         Members of the "True Love Waits" group protest against the government policy of encouraging the use of condoms to'combat Aids. The group
