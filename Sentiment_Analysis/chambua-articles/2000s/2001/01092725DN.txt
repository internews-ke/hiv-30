This\r\n  combination leaves a slimy mixture of grease and\r\n  dung in the water.\r\n     A few meters away, residents wash clothes from\r\n  the riverbanks. The water they use streams back\r\n  freely into the river. Further downstream, another\r\n  group of unsuspecting villagers will fetch this same\r\n  water for domestic use.\r\n     The main culprits in the pollution of the river are\r\n  upstream, however. They are the extensive flower\r\n  plantations near Egerton University whose regular\r\n  use of pesticides has caused an alarming\r\n  accumulation of chemical residues in the river.\r\n     It has been claimed that these chemicals,\r\n  together with phosphate and nitrate fertilizers used                                                                                                                                                               Photo/Joseph Gichuk\r\n   by most farmers have been almost exclusively\r\n  responsible for the contamination of Lake Nakuru,                  Face of despair: A clear proof of what extensive deforestation can lead to.
