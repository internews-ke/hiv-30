 Political will needed to force down prices, says NGO
        By DENNIS ONYANGO
Kenyans may not benefit from the cheap-
est Aids drugs offered so far because the
Govemment has not shown the political
commitment humanitarian agencies say is
necessary to make the drugs available.
     This is the second time in about three
months that activists campaigning for
availability of cheap Aids drugs in Kenya
are accusing the Government of being
reluctant to enable its citizens to access
the life-saving medicines.
     The accusation comes amid rising
indications that the battle for access to
drugs will be won or lost not in science
laboratories or hospitals but on the streets
and in court rooms.
     It also comes amid growing criticism
of pharmaceutical companies such as
GlaxoSmithkline, which charity and med-
ical organisations accuse of waging "an
undeclared drugs war" against the poor.
     The Kenyan chapter of Medecins Sans
 Frontieres (doctors without borders),
 says there is no commitment from the
 ministries of trade andhealth to press for
 cheap drugs. "There does not seem to be
 a clear policy on Aids in Kenya. Even the
 Government's recently launched strategic
 plan on Aids does not offer much," said
 Ms Indra Van Gisbergen, spokesperson
 for Medicins Sans Frontieres in Nairobi.
      It is not only the humanitarian agen-
 cies complaining. Pharmaceutical firms           ~o hope .••an Aids victim lies in a hospital bed waiting to die. The Aids pandemic could be contained if the Gov-

 of drugs also say the Government is
 reluctant to help.
      An official at GlaxoWellcome said          Government on the
 there is no political will from the Govern-
 ment to help the company fulfil its prom-
 ise to deliver cheap drugs to Kenyans.
 "Just like other matters the Government
 has been slow to implement, it is drag-
 ging its feet on helping us provide cheap       spot over lack of
 drugs then we are seen as the bad peo-
 ple," the official said.
      Last week, Oxfam, a British charity
 organisation, singled out GlaxoSmithK-
 poor countries to produce low-cost equiv-
 line and warned that throughout 200 I,          access to Aids drugs
  Oxfam would be targeting the British
  pharmaceutical firm for refusing to allow
 alents of some life-saving medicines pat-
 ented by the company.
      At the launch of its "cut-the-cost"
 campaign early this week, Oxfam said
 developing countries should be allowed
 to produce copies of drugs to treat Aids,
 respiratory infections and diarrhoea in
 children.
      ActionAid and MSF, the leading activ-
  istsin Kenya, say they fear that their
 efforts will hit a dead end if the Govern-
 ment does not explain how it plans to
 take advantage of the offer for cheap
  drugs by Cipla, an Indian pharmaceutical
  firm .
      The non-governmental organisations
  S2Y    the Government's      strategic plan
  unveiled recently says nothing about Aids
  treatment in the next five years. The plan,
  J\O~ Gisbergen said, does not mention
  compulsory licensing, which the activists
  have maintained would be the best way to
  bring down prices legally.
