It is giving up the\r\nbusiness altogether and leasing out its remaining buses to\r\nwildcat operators.\r\n   The m:w operators, in turn, are competing with all manner\r\nof buses that have somehow been allowed to operate in the\r\ncity usin,g facilities originally installed and maintained by the\r\nKBS.\r\n   The degeneration of service is apparent.
