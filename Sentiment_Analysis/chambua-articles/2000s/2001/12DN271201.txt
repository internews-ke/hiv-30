Zambia candidate for coalition
 A government of national unity the best for healing wounds, he says as poll dawns
       LUSAKA, Wednesday
Zambian businessman and presidential
candidate Anderson Mazoka said on
Wednesday he would be ready to work
with his political rivals to form a gov-
ernment of national unity if he won
Thursday's elections.
   Mr Mazoka said Zambia was deeply
divided and a government of national
unity was the first step to healing the
wounds from the closest-fought general
election since independence from Brit-
ain 37 years ago.
   "We have always advocated a gov-
ernment of national unity. We are
ready to work with some of our col-
leagues. This country is so deeply
divided right now that a coalition would
be the first step towards healing," Mr
Mazoka told Reuters in an interview.
   Zambia has become increasingly
divided along ethnic lines since outgo-
ing President Frederick Chiluba came
to power in 1991. Critics say President
Chiluba gave key government positions
to members of the northern Bemba-
speaking groups, his constituency, and
ignored other tribes.
   An opinion poll showed this week
that Mr Mazoka held a slim lead over
rivals Levy Patrick Mwanawasa of the
ruling Movement          for Multiparty
Democracy (MMD) and former Vice
President Christon Tembo, leader of
the opposition Forum for Democracy
and Development (FDD), in a presi-
dential race that has 11 candidates but
no clear front-runner.
   However, the poll also showed that it
would be difficult for any party to win
one-third of the 150 elected seats in
parliament, making a coalition govern-
ment likely.
   Mr Mazoka's chances in Thursday's
presidential and parliamentary elec-
tions improved last week after he
received an unexpected endorsement
from founding President          Kenneth
Kaunda, who called him "a man of
integrity    and a good economic
manager".
