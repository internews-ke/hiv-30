 Aids summit should
 draft anÂ· action plan
 The Organisation    of African Unity Summit on Aids, Tuber-
 culosis and other Related Infectious      Diseases qpened in
 Abuja yesterday     in the wake of grim statistics that plate
 Africa as the world's most devastated continent.
    According    to the UN, more than 17 million Africans
 have died of Aids since 1984, while 25 million are .living
 with the virus. Since at least 36 million people are infected
 with HIV in the whole worldj almost twice as many Afri-
 cans are dying of the scourge as the rest of the world.
    But it would be everyone's         hope that the summit,
 attended by at least 47 heads of state, will seek answers to
 the most nagging        issue: how to stem Aids. As OAU
 Secretary-General     Salim Ahmed Salim indicated, the main
 purpose of the summit is to come up with a continental
 action plan on how to combat the scourge, for Africa suf-
 fers fr~m the double handicap        of being both poor and
 without access to cheap drugs to keep Aids' victims alive
 longer.
    One of the planks in the action plan would be to seek                  COMMENTARY
 finances to fight the pandemic. It is a fact that most African
 countries do not have the resources to wage a sustained war
 on the plague, and so a global effort is required. It is in that
 light that Dr Salim on Tuesday asked the world for $7                    This country's future
 billion, saying the current $700 million annual assistance is
 but a drop in the ocean.
    The other issue likely to be considered will be the role
 the state ought to play in providing cheaper drugs. Thou-
 sands of HIV -positive people are dying needlessly because               depends on law review
 they cannot afford these drugs.
     There has been a controversy    over the issue of generic
 drugs. Western pharmaceutical     companies have even .gone
 to court in South Africa to stop it procuring.or   manufactur-                                                                                                                                          '.
