    A              organisation working with and learn-
                   ing from local communities to create
    life of dignity. The organisation's HIV/Aids pro-
    gramme, in its formative stages, is working with,
    among many others, two Community-Based
    Organisations (CBOs) in Kibwezi and Narok.
        In the Narok project, it is working with an
    organisation known as Pillar of Hope and in
    Kibwezi with the Foundation Agency For Rural
    Development.
        It has given grants of Sh60,OOO POH  to
    through a volunteer in public health Ms Chris-
    tine Peterson and Mr Joseph Kiplia the co-
    ordinator and Sh3million to FARD to fund a
    resource centre, office, testing and counselling,
     library centre and has provided bicycles to facil-
     itate transport to enable the volunteers access
     the interior and educate people on Aids.
        According to Dr Chris Ouma who has been
    working in the HIV/Aids project and with
    patients in various hospitals, the organisation
    has laid down three major strategies in its fight
    against the pandemic.
        Statistics obtained from POH indicate that
    Narok has the fourth highest transmission rate
    at almost 21 per cent with over 12,000 infected
    people.        ,                                        ActionAid Kenya supports local communities innovation and learning to find home-grown solutions to their problems. Communities are
