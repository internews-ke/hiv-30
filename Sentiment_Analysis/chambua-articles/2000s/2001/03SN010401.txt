BALALA DECRIES BLOOD SHORTAGE
BY SUNDAY NATION CORRESPONDENT

Kenya's blDod bank is bankrupt
and the country might soon be
forced to import bloDd for emergency
cases.
The chairman of the Mombasa
'branch of the Kenya National
Chamber of Commerce and Indus-
.try, Mr Najib Balala, said there
were only 16 units of blood at the
blood bank situated off Moi Avenue,
Mombasa, which he said was
dangerously IDw in the event of an
emergency in the town.
The chamber bDss made the
remarks during the closing ceremony
of a five-day MDmbasa Global
Strategies for HIV prevention
training workshop for communitysed
health workers at the Reef
tel on Friday evening.
When he went to donate blood
-at the centre on Friday morning,
Mr Balala was told people no
longer donated blood, forcing the
centre tD consider importing
blDod.
Mr Balala said that if people
, were scared of donating blood, it
indicated that they would not volunteer
for HlV screening.
The workshop was attended by
medical workers from Kenya,
Uganda, Tanzania and other African
countries.
Mr Balala said the chamber
invites medical practitioners,
community-based health workers
and other stakeholders to work
with the business community in
seeking ways of addressing the
effects of HlV/Aids.
The chamber boss said it was
distressing that while everybody
talked about HIV/Aids, few were
doing genuine work in combating
the scourge. TD some, the scourge
has become big business and
were capitalising on the situation
to make money .
Other than talking and coming
up with strategy papers, he said,
the gDvernment was not doing
anything tangible in the health
sector to support people living
with HIV/Aids.
Meanwhile, the deputy chief
administrator of the Coast General
Hospital, Dr D. l. Mwangi.
has said that between 30 and 50
per cent of TB patients in Kenya
are infected with HlV and that at
least 40 per cent of Aids deaths
are due to TB.
Dr Mwangi, who is the head
of clinical services, said 65,000
TB cases were reported in the
year 2000 alone.
He was speaking during the
closing ceremony for STD/HIV/
Aids counsellors' training workshop
at the Jocham Hospital,
Kengeleni on Friday evening.
The hospital's executive director,
Dr John Mutua Chamia, said
the hospital had embarked on
community-based care for HIV/
Aids patients in North Coast.
He said the training for trainers
initiative will target vulnerable
groups like beach boys,
among others.
