It is the first\r\n  ever recording of the fish species in East African\r\n  waters.\r\n     Until 1938, when a living coelacanth was dis-\r\n  covered off the eastern coast of South Africa, at\r\n  the mouth of the Chalumna River near East Lon-\r\n  don, coelacanths were known only from ancient\r\n  fossils - some dating back more than 360 million\r\n  years. Their sudden disappearance from the fossil\r\n  record about 80 million years ago suggested that\r\n  coelacanths had become extinct at the same time\r\n  as the dinosaurs.\r\n      Kenya's very own coelacanth, properly\r\n  mounted and displayed, could become a major\r\n  attraction for tourists and the public. For coe1a-\r\n  canths are so very seldom captured that only a\r\n  few museums around the world can boast of hav-\r\n  ing one.\r\n      Like many great discoveries, the fish was cap-\r\n   tured accidentally by the crew of mv Venture II\r\n   at a depth of 85 metres. They did not even know\r\n   what they had stumbled on.\r\n      The fish was kept frozen for nearly four\r\n   months, and in virtual obscurity, in the cold stor-\r\n   age depot of Wananchi Marine Products, for\r\n   whom the trawler had been working when the                                                                                                                                                                                    Photo/National Museums of Kenya\r\n   fish was caught, Mr Ali Kaka the executive direc-\r\n                                                                                     RARE CATCH: Officials of the National Museums of Kenya, Nairobi, marvel at the unique features of the coelacanth which was caught\r\n   tor of East African Wildlife Society said.\r\n                                                                                     off Malindi.
