A great number\r\n  of useful, active and youthful people infected with HIV are\r\n  enfeebling the country's health institutions with demands on\r\n  drugs and facilities to treat the myriad opportunistic infec-\r\n  tions. In some areas, more than half the bedspaces in major\r\n  hospitals are occupied by Aids patients.\r\n      They cannot be turned away without treatment, and yet,\r\n  there are other patients who need the health facilities, too.\r\n  There is a continuing campaign to shift the strain visited on\r\n  hospitals by Aids patients to homes where they can receive\r\n  care among family, but even this approach has its\r\n  limitations.\r\n      A plan to provide cheap and affordable medication that\r\n would allow people to live longer, healthier lives. and con-\r\n tinue to contribute to their families and society seems to be\r\n lacking.\r\n      But access to Aids medication has proved critical in pro-\r\n longing lives to a considerable degree in developed coun-\r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1~...\r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \u00b7.\u00b7\r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \".\r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ~;\r\n tries.
