{"text": " 6\r\n DAILY\r\n NATION Nairobi, Thursday, April 26, 2001\r\n Aids summit should\r\n draft an\u00b7 action plan\r\n The Organisation    of African Unity Summit on Aids, Tuber-\r\n culosis and other Related Infectious      Diseases qpened in\r\n Abuja yesterday     in the wake of grim statistics that plate\r\n Africa as the world's most devastated continent.\r\n    According    to the UN, more than 17 million Africans\r\n have died of Aids since 1984, while 25 million are .living\r\n with the virus. Since at least 36 million people are infected\r\n with HIV in the whole worldj almost twice as many Afri-\r\n cans are dying of the scourge as the rest of the world.\r\n    But it would be everyone's         hope that the summit,\r\n attended by at least 47 heads of state, will seek answers to\r\n the most nagging        issue: how to stem Aids. As OAU\r\n Secretary-General     Salim Ahmed Salim indicated, the main\r\n purpose of the summit is to come up with a continental\r\n action plan on how to combat the scourge, for Africa suf-\r\n fers fr~m the double handicap        of being both poor and\r\n without access to cheap drugs to keep Aids' victims alive\r\n longer.\r\n    One of the planks in the action plan would be to seek                  COMMENTARY\r\n finances to fight the pandemic. It is a fact that most African\r\n countries do not have the resources to wage a sustained war\r\n on the plague, and so a global effort is required. It is in that\r\n light that Dr Salim on Tuesday asked the world for $7                    This country's future\r\n billion, saying the current $700 million annual assistance is\r\n but a drop in the ocean.\r\n    The other issue likely to be considered will be the role\r\n the state ought to play in providing cheaper drugs. Thou-\r\n sands of HIV -positive people are dying needlessly because               depends on law review\r\n they cannot afford these drugs.\r\n     There has been a controversy    over the issue of generic\r\n drugs. Western pharmaceutical     companies have even .gone\r\n to court in South Africa to stop it procuring.or   manufactur-                                                                                                                                          '.\r\n ing cheaper generic drugs.
