DELAY RECOMMENDED IN AIDS TREATMENT

CHICAGO, TUESDAY
New guidelines for the treatment
of the human immunodeficiency
virus released here
this week advise doctors to
begin anti-viral. therapy at a
later stage than previously
recommended.
Under the recommendations
put forward by the National
Institutes of Health (NIH),
released during the 8th Annual
Retrovirus Conference, the
treatment should not begin
until the total count of CD-4
or T cells in the body's
immune system falls below
350 per cubic millimetre of
blood. In the past, treatment
was recommended when the
count was 500 per cubic
millimetre.
Experts said the recommendations
for a delayed start were
an acknowledgement of the
serious side effects of the treatment
which include toxicity to
the liver and pancreas and elevated
cholesterol in the blood.
However, the NIH noted
that for patients whose CD-4
cell count is higher than 350
per cubic millimetre of blood,
treatment may still be considered
if the level of HIV in the
bloodstream is 30,000 viruses
per millimetre of blood using
DNA testing. Previously, the
limit was 10,000 viruses per
millimetre.
The'updated guidelines "recognise
that we do not yet have
the data we need to make definitive
recommendations about
the optimal time to start treatment,"
said one of the authors,
John Bartlett, chief of the division
of infectious diseases at
the Johns Hopkins University
Medical Center in Baltimore,
Maryland.
"We highlight the uncertainty,
allow for flexibility, encourage
an individualised approach
to treatment, and, aphe same
time, trY to' provid~.gtmt~ce;'
he added. 
The g~ldelines<aJ.strlincirPorate
two new treatments for
HIV infection which come
"strongly recommended" - the
protease inhibitor Kaletra, a coformulation
of ritonavir and
lopinavir and the combination
ofritonavir and indinavir.
Finally, the authors of the
report stressed the importance
of sticking to the anti-viral
treatment regimen that must be
followed for the rest of the
patient's life.
"Extraordinarily high rates of
adherence to an antiviral drug
regimen are necessary to maintain
control over HIV replication,"
Bartlett said.
Some 3,000 researchers and
doctors are attending the fourday
conference on Aids that
opened on Sunday. (AFP)
