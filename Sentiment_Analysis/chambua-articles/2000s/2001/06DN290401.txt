Ban suspect test
for typhoid cases
The Ministry of Health has not, so far, responded to an
important message coming across from this week's confer-
ence of doctors. It is that Kenyans - a whole 40 of them
- died quite needlessly from a typhoid outbreak at Embu
recently.
   What was the matter? According to the experts taking
part in the teach-in: at the lakeside town of Kisumu on
Friday, the tragedy was a result of a testing method called                                                                                                                                                                                 j
Widal, widely used in Government health institutions.
   Apparently, Widal yields information that is often false.
It indicates negative where other, more reliable, methods                                                                                                                                                                                   I
indicate positive, thus misleading medical workers into pre-
scribing the wrong medicine, occasioning severe infections
and, not infrequently, death.
   The Kenya Medical Association's annual scientific con-
ference - attended by experts from" Uganda, Tanzania,
Rwanda and as far afield as South Africa and India -
heard that Widal tests remained popular for detecting sal-
monella thyphi, the bacterium which causes typhoid, even
after many local doctors had raised this matter with the
ministry.
   Said Dr J. K. Muraguri: "We have recommended to the
Health Ministry to ban Widal testing. And it is now up to it      NEWS ANALYSIS
to act. In the Embu case, there was a lot of confusion since
it was compounded by malarial parasites in the victims."
   What the doctor implies here - a point enunciated by
by Government doctors.
Prof Ochola Odeng - is that the testing of typhoid at
Embu, because it was not thorough enough to include a .           Profit versus life· in
search for malaria in the patient, was a dereliction of duty
   The upshot is that the disease, even when it breaks out
