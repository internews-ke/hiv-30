Such conduct is unworthy of\r\n      ist hardly an edifying spectacle for 'two Appeal Court\r\nI   judges to trade accusations publicly, and even to start\r\nprominent members of the Bench, especially when the\r\nlanguage used turns out to be loaded with tar and innuendo.\r\n   While we cannot go into the specifics of the case in which\r\nMr Justice Richard Kwach accused two of his colleagues, Mr\r\nA.B. Shah, and Mr Philip Tonui, of suspect behaviour by\r\ndisallowing an appeal they had earlier agreed should go on, it\r\nis astonishing that the learned judges would not conduct the\r\naffair with decorum, even allowing for the need to air the\r\nissue publicly.\r\n    We are not in a position to pass judgment on the merits of\r\nthe case, but we take exception to the base language used in\r\nthe altercation.\r\n    Nevertheless,   since the matter is now out, we support the\r\nLaw Society of Kenya in their call to Chief Justice Bernard\r\n Chunga and to President Moi to set up a tribunal that would\r\n investigate the whole sorry incident, and many others that,\r\n presumably, do not come to public limelight.              _\r\n    Kenyans would, for instance, want to know exactly what\r\nprompted a judge of Mr Justice Kwach's calibre to call for\r\naction \"to redeem the reputation of the Court of Appeal\".\r\n    They would also like to be told why Mr Justice Tunoi\r\nbelieves his colleague was only seeking cheap publicity and\r\nactin.g.like a.buffoon.
