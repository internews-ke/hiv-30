T      o single out the Ndegwa Commission of 1971 as the
        caus.e o~ th.e un!a~homab.le moral decay in our public
from which It has always spiralled.
    F.or as soon as.it aut~orised public servants to run private
busmesses, conflict of mterest and corruption were
inevitable.
    The temptation to steal public resources became
inexo~able. Service ~~s soo~ p~edicated on massive bribery.
The history of our civil service ISthus a history of sustained
public robbery.
    That is the ~ight in w.hich the economic-crimes amnesty the
G~vernment ISpro.posmg must be seen. Its desirability lies in
~ sImple fact. Any mdependent and thorough inquiry might
find everybody - from the filing clerk to the permanent
secretary - guilty.
    To be sure, the amount involved is stupendous. It could
so!ve all our budget deficit problems. It would be a terrible
crIme not to recover that money from individuals and punish
them. Of course.
    Bu~ if you started probing and then prosecuting all the
c~lpnts, wher~ would you end? It would be a truly anarchic
wltch-.hunt. It ISnot merely that they are too many. Much
mor~ Important than that, any really serious inquiry would
reqUire as much money as you are seeking to recover.                                                                            WHY WE ARE DYING 0 JOHN MBARIA
