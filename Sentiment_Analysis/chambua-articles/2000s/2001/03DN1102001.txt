AIDS ORDER OPPOSED
TSC ASKED TO WITHDRAW CIRCULAR ON HIV LIST

Teachers yesterday demanded the
withdrawal of a circular directing
education officers to list those
suffering from Aids.
They also demanded an apology
from the Teachers Service
Commission and accused the secretary,
Mr Benjamin Sogomo of
being unprofessional.
Mr Sogomo told the Nation
yesterday that the commission
did not intend to go round checking
the health status of teachers
but only required information on
the death rate of teachers without
giving any names to the education
officers.
Press reports indicated yesterday
that the TSC had in a circular
signed by Mr Sogomo instructed
all district and municipal education
officers to compile a list of
all sickly teachers to determine
the number of Aids sufferers.
The details sought include statistics
on how many teachers may
be too weak to perform their
duties and how many have died of
Aids in the previous month.
The Kenya National Union of
Teachers threatened to throw the
education sector into disarray if
the circular was not withdrawn.
Deputy Secretary general Francis
Ng'ang'a said: "The circular
was carelessly done, alarmist and
intended to discriminate against
and condemn teachers. Who is a
sickly teacher? Doesn't the TSC
know that HIV tests can only be
carried out by qualified personnel
and that there is no law compelling
teachers to undertake the
tests?"
However, a copy of the circular
obtained by the Nation
revealed that it had been copied
to the teachers' union.
It reads: "Heads of schools are
informed that cases of teachers
who are too weak 'to carry out
their teaching duties should be
treated as patients of any other
disease and be handled as per the
code of regulations for teachers."
Meanwhile, the Kenya Human
Rights Commission said the circular
was disturbing because it
meant that the Aids scourge was
emerging as a discrimination"criteria
in work places.
The Programmes Officer for
Advocacy, Mr Mugambi Kiai,
said that Aids sufferers should not
be discriminated against as long
as they did not threaten the health
of others and were. able to discharge
their duties and
responsibilities.
