Ensure schools are
regularly inspected
While it is common knowledge that living conditions in
most boarding schools are sub-standard, the level to which
some of the schools have sunk is disturbing. Many students
are, in fact, living in shockingly pathetic conditions, where
congestion, filth and squalor predominate.
   As a report in our education supplement today illustrates,
a majority of boarding schools have sunk to lowly levels
indeed.
   The report, quoting a confidential Government inspection
report, says that in many schools, students are forced to eat
under trees or even in classrooms for lack of dining halls.
Congestion in dormitories is common and sanitary facilities
are inadequate and unhygienic. Most laboratories have
fallen into disuse due to lack of equipment, while kitchens
lack basic structures like ventilators.
   Ironically, most of the schools reeling from these kind of
problems are engaged in grandiose development projects
like building fancy administration blocks, buying school
buses and even building swimming pools.
   Contrary to common belief, this does not apply only to         SPECIAL REPORT
rural areas. Schools in urban areas are equally affected.
   This deterioration is happening even as all schools are
supposed to be routinely inspected by Government officials.
But the inspectorate arm of the Ministry of Education is          Why poverty reduction

quate personnel, lack of facilities and lack of training. In a
general sense, schools are rarely ever inspected.
   Even where such inspections are carried out, the inspec-

ing the grosser details of the day-to-day lives of students.
   A harsh, unfriendly environment is not conducive to
learning. It can only induce stress in students, dealing a
blow to their academic pursuits.                                      By KAP-KIRWOK JASON                                                                                           and important goals of wealth dis-
