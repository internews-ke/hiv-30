Is motion's defeat
a sign of the times?
It was not surprising that the Government             yesterday mar-
shalled its forces in Parliament to vote out a motion seeking
to establish a Truth and Reconciliation      Commission.
   It is an outcome that might be seen as quite scandalous.
But what might be even more scandalous is that, in a House
composed of 222 members, less than half found it worth
their while to debate such a critical issue.
   The proposal, by Mr Peter 0100 Aringo, is grounded on
the sensitive     issue of the political       transition    with the
expected exit of the only president the majority of Kenyans
have ever known. That the debate, in Parliament, degener-
ated into insults, highly scurrilous personal attacks and even
ethnic sabre-rattling,  is highly regrettable.
   But that, probably, is what might best illustrate the extent
of mistrust, suspicion and fear afflicting the national body
politic. The strange effect is that those who stand to benefit
most from a process which might ultimately result in for-
giveness and reconciliation,     are the ones taking a reflexive
stand against any such proposal.
   Amnesty, as envisaged, presupposes        that a crime has been
committed and that the perpetrator is willing to confess and
plead for forgiveness.
   Those in power now are not about to surrender their                      NEWS ANALYSIS

   The upshot is that until there is an clement of goodwill
fashioning a smooth transition.
   Indeed, there is cause for worry. What some opposition
politicians are putting across is that they cannot wait for                 sea over Aids scourge
