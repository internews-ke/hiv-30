 An atmosphere of concentration pervades the small
weJI-ventilated room. The tall slender man clicks on
a file in his computer, and waits for it to open. His
face finally beams with joy as the printer produces
copies of his work.
   Beside him is a non-conventional lVC radio con-
nected to a special adapter card from the Pentium
computer. On the other end, the radio is connected
to a detachable micro-dish receiver, the antenna,
safely placed outside the window                        .
   Don't be mistaken, for this is not a cyber cafe. It
is the office of Mr Alsen Oduwo. And now he is in
WorldSpace. As the Information and "Training
Manager at Community Mobilisation Against
Desertification, he is busy downloading useful
information on development to disseminate to
OEganisation members ..
   Though based in the rural market centre of
Rongo in Migori district, the organisation has kept
abreast of new technologies within its scope of
operation. Thanks to the Arid Lands Information
Network - Eastern Africa that has partnered with
the digital broadcast pioneer, WorldSpace Fe,unda-
tion of USA, to get information to the remote areas
using digital satellite broadcasting.
   Currently operating in four countries - Kl:nya,
Uganda, Tanzania and Ethiopia, the network aims
at improving the development practices of co:nmu-
nity development workers in drylands Africa by
facilitating exchange of experience among them,
and disseminating appropriate information on
s~Cialand development issues.
   "Looking at the current trend in communication
technology, we realised that people living far away
from major towns and cities that are already over-
flowing with facilities like Internet, E-mails and sta-
ble telephone lines, can't cope in this era of tech-
nology for lack of appropriate information. WI: felt
