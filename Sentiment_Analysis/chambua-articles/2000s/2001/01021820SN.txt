Even the\r\n Government's recently launched strategic\r\n plan on Aids does not offer much,\" said\r\n Ms Indra Van Gisbergen, spokesperson\r\n for Medicins Sans Frontieres in Nairobi.\r\n      It is not only the humanitarian agen-\r\n cies complaining. Pharmaceutical firms           ~o hope .\u2022\u2022an Aids victim lies in a hospital bed waiting to die. The Aids pandemic could be contained if the Gov-\r\n that are being challenged to cut the prices      ernment committed itself to acquiring some of the affordable drugs being offered by pharmaceutical companies.\r\n of drugs also say the Government is\r\n reluctant to help.\r\n      An official at GlaxoWellcome said          Government on the\r\n there is no political will from the Govern-\r\n ment to help the company fulfil its prom-\r\n ise to deliver cheap drugs to Kenyans.\r\n \"Just like other matters the Government\r\n has been slow to implement, it is drag-\r\n ging its feet on helping us provide cheap       spot over lack of\r\n drugs then we are seen as the bad peo-\r\n ple,\" the official said.\r\n      Last week, Oxfam, a British charity\r\n organisation, singled out GlaxoSmithK-\r\n poor countries to produce low-cost equiv-\r\n line and warned that throughout 200 I,          access to Aids drugs\r\n  Oxfam would be targeting the British\r\n  pharmaceutical firm for refusing to allow\r\n alents of some life-saving medicines pat-\r\n ented by the company.\r\n      At the launch of its \"cut-the-cost\"\r\n campaign early this week, Oxfam said\r\n developing countries should be allowed\r\n to produce copies of drugs to treat Aids,\r\n respiratory infections and diarrhoea in\r\n children.\r\n      ActionAid and MSF, the leading activ-\r\n  istsin Kenya, say they fear that their\r\n efforts will hit a dead end if the Govern-\r\n ment does not explain how it plans to\r\n take advantage of the offer for cheap\r\n  drugs by Cipla, an Indian pharmaceutical\r\n  firm .\r\n      The non-governmental organisations\r\n  S2Y    the Government's      strategic plan\r\n  unveiled recently says nothing about Aids\r\n  treatment in the next five years. The plan,\r\n  J\\O~ Gisbergen said, does not mention\r\n  compulsory licensing, which the activists\r\n  have maintained would be the best way to\r\n  bring down prices legally.\r\n       \"Kenya could playa major role in an                                               Angelina Nyavonyo, an Aids victim whose mother died of the scourge.
