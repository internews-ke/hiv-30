 KPLCexcuses won't do
                We hope the Kenya Power and Lighting Company
 W              will not be the latest in a long line of state-owned
                or state-controlled enterprises that have been
                driven to ruin over the years.                     '
      The latest financial report on the once-profitable and highly
   efficient power distribution utility makes depressing reading.
      The bottom line is that an already cash-strapped
  Government is being forced to bail out a corporation which, if
  it were not a monopoly offering such essential services, would
  otherwise have been left to sink (or swim).
     We have heard a litany of excuses for KPLC's poor results,
  such as prolonged drought and power rationing. But these are
  just that - excuses.
     If the KPLC were run like a private company, there is no
  doubt, the management would be having to answer a lot of
  hard questions from the board of directors. The board would,
  in turn, be squirming in front of irate shareholders.
     Not so, in this case. The KPLC is supposed to be a public
  company. It is quoted on the Nairobi Stock Exchange. Yet it
  is run and managed just like any other parastatal. That is
  because the Government holds the controlling shares. And
  so it prefers to exercise absolute control by appointing a pliant
  board and politically correct senior management.
     As a mere public trustee, the Government should be in the
  forefront in demanding minimum, if not maximum,
  performance by the management and the board. Instead the
  takes it upon itself to proffer all manner of excuses for the
  company's poor performance.                                                                                  LIFE OR PROFITS? 0 DAGI KIMANI
