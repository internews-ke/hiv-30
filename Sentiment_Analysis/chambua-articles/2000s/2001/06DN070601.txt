  Visionary Dlove on
  the Maasai Mara
   The Trans Mara County Council has made a bold and
   visionary move by turning over its section of the Maasai
  Mara Game Reserve to a non-profit foundation to manage.
      But no sooner had the ink dried on the signature on the
  renewable five-year agreement with the Mara Conservancy
  than some civic leaders cried foul.
, Such a reaction should probably have been expected, but
  it is not the kind of initiative that should be reduced to
  ill-informed political wrangling.
     The councillors opposed to the arrangement may well
  have some valid points. But they failed to present a cogent
  argument after travelling all the way from Kilgoris to
  address a press conference in Nairobi yesterday. Instead,
  they resorted to baseless accusations and wild finger-
 pointing.
     No one in his right mind would deny that the wider
 Maasai Mara National Reserve has been grossly misman-
 aged through the years. The old Narok County Council,
 before Trans Mara District was created, should have been
 one of the richest local authorities in the country. But mil-
 lions of shillings in revenue were diverted by greedy local
 leaders.
     In the end, the Maasai Mara was reduced to no more than       COMMENTARY
 a declining cash-cow ready for blatant milking by which-
 ever political faction happened to be on the ascendancy. It
 also became the battleground for vicious fights between           Aids has come of age,
 contending interests.
     The drama a few years ago when Dr Richard Leakey was
 hounded out of the Kenya Wildlife Service had something.
 to do with his desire to take over and introduce profession-
 alism and honesty in running the Mara.                            but does anyone care?
     A few years later, there was yet another vicious battle
 when communities outside the reserve's boundaries, but
 within the Mara-Serengeti ecosystem, realised they could
 run their own tourist facilities - and benefit directly from                                                                                                                                            I
