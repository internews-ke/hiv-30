 AIDS SUMMIT
 Silence
 as key
 meeting
 begins
       UNITED NATIONS. Monday
   The United Nations General
   Assembly today began a three-
   day special session on HIV/Aids
   with a minute's silence to com-
   memorate the 22 million people
   who have died of the disease.
      Two dozen heads of state and
   government were due to address
   the session, the first in the 56-
   year history of the United Nations
   that has been devoted to a public
   health issue.
      Some 36 million people are
   infected worldwide with Aids or
   HIV, the virus that causes it, with
   25 million in Africa alone. The
   killer disease is rapidly spreading
   through Asia, the Caribbean and
   Eastern Europe.
      "Everybody has come to this
   late," said Mr Stephen Lewis, the
   UN Aids envoy for Africa. "The
   world has been seized and galva-
   nised only over the last 18           Nkos~Joh~son, the ~2-year-?ld South Afr.ican b?y .wh~ became an ico~ in the ~truggle against HIV/Aids. He died on June 1. On
