Rwandan widows face slow-motion genocide

By William Maclean
Seven years on, history's fastest
genocide reaps a slow-motion
harvest of death.
Jeanette Uwimane lost her husband
and five children in the 100-
day slaughter of 800,000 minority
Tutsis and moderate Hutus in
1994.
Hutu extremist killers stuffed
the small corpses of the children
into a pit latrine, then subjected
her to repeated rape as a sex
slave.
She contracted the HIV virus
that causes AIDS, and now her
ailing body is a daily reminder
that the evil which destroyed her
family will one day reach out
from history for a final
reckoning.
A photograph on a table in her
small single-storey house shows
Uwimane in happier times, a vigorous
young woman wearing an
amused expression and a spectacular
Afro hairstyle.
At 39 she remains beautiful but
is a shrunken figure. Lesions
cover her arms. She can flash a
brilliant smile, but in quiet
moments she tells visitors it
masks her true emotions.
"Y ou see my smile. But
inwardly I am suffering," she
says.
Like thousands of other AIDSinfccted
genocide widows, she
wants to tell her story in a court
of law before she weakens further,
to help render justice and
possibly hasten long-awaited
compensation for the two of her
children that survived.
But it is a race against time as
the trials of accused killers
remain slow and disease spreads
through her body.
Uwimane is one of 25,000
members of the A VEGAAGAHOZO,
an association of
genocide widows who have
banded together to try to survive
dcspite a host of genocide-related
ailments.
Bereft of organised medical
care, the widows are also ravaged
by a range of other
sexually-transmitted diseases
caused by rape. Some sufTer a
host of untreated infections, internal
disorders, and disabilities
caused by deep machete wounds.
Like most, Uwimane gets no
treatment for AIDS as she ekes
out her life in a ramshackle village
built by AVEGA with the
help of foreign donors near the
capital Kigali.
The settlement of 185 houses is
unfinished and has no power or
running water because Rwandan
state funding has temporarily run
out. The women walk five km
(three miles) to plots to grow
food and fetch water, but some
are too weak to make the journey.
Other survivors live in total
destitution in urban areas, with
many afraid to return to their villages
because their homes are
destroyed or they suspect some
killers remain at liberty ..
Uwimane reflects on the regular
meals and medical attention
enjoyed by the accused masterminds
of the massacres awaiting
trial in a modem prison at a U.N.
tribunal in Arusha, Tanzania.
Those who have comfort are
in Arusha," she says with a wistful
smile. "The international community
prefers to give aid to the
detained people, not to the
survivors."
Medicines to prolong her life --
which could cost $280 a month --
is unimaginably costly, says
AVEGA official Sylvia Barakagwira
who lost her husband in the
massacres.
She said an AVEGA study of
925 genocide widows found twothirds
were HIV-positive and 80
percent were traumatised by the
loss of loved ones and gang
rapes. None have received any
form of compensation from a
governl:lent bereft of resources.
"No single survivor has got
any compensation," she said.
"The government says compensation
should not be on an
individual basis, but the widows
will all be dead by the time they
set up an alternative programme."
To the widows, conditions for
reconciliation do not exist.
"When you see killers all
around, and those killers have not
confessed, and politicians make
speeches about the need for reconciliation,
then this is hard for
us," Barakagwira said.
"Reconciliation can come only
from justice."
The genocidc destroyed the
normally powerful self-help
mechanism of the African
extended family, leaving widows
bereft of help with the unfamiliar
task of tending fields and growing
crops.
The widows are grateful to
their government for providinl!
security in the country -- and
deploying guards for the village
after locals from nearby settlements
identified the widows as a
soft target and began stealing
from their homes.
Feelings can run high when
foreigners come to visit.
Widows ask visitors about how
they are portrayed in European
television documentaries, and are
curious about the feelings that
inspire people in rich countries to
give aid.
"You must not see us as if we
are mountain gorillas," said genocide
widow Marie Bahizi.
"We are not a tourist attraction.
We are living an unbearable life."
