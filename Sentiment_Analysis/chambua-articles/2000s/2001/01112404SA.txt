{"text": "\ufeffSaturday Nation/ November 24, 2001\r\n\r\nCOMPULSORY HIV TESTS PROPOSED FOR PRISONERS\r\n\r\nBy Mark Agutu\r\nNew prisoners should undergo mandatory\r\nHIV - tests and those\u00b7 infected isolated,\r\nit has been proposed.\r\nThis would be the most effective way\r\nof curbing the spread among inmates,\r\nlobby groups, doctors and others told\r\nthe Legal Task Force on HIV/Aids at\r\nNakuru on Thursday evening.\r\nAt present, inmates are lumped\r\ntogether and this \"condemns uninfected\r\nprisoners to HIV infection mainly\r\nthrough homosexuality and other vices\r\nrampant in prisons\", the speakers said.\r\nCivil servant Jacinta Were said: \"A\r\nlaw should be enacted to provide for\r\ncompulsory tests for prisoners. It should\r\nalso guarantee separation of infected\r\ninmates to prevent transmission to others.\"\r\n. But other speakers opposed idea, saying\r\nit would be a violation of prisoners'\r\nand other people's human rights.\r\nSports administrator Issa Gichangi\r\nsaid pre-employment HIV-testing was\r\nbeing carried out without prior counselling,\r\ndevastating those found with the\r\nvirus.\r\n\"They are left in a state of shock as\r\nthey are not well-prepared before being\r\ntested,\" he said. \"Consequently, their\r\nhealth deteriorates due to fear and\r\nshock.\"\r\nOther speakers proposed laws spelling\r\nout tougher measures, including death,\r\nfor those who knowingly spread HIV.\r\nMs Margaret Ouko, an anti-Aids\r\ncampaign programme officer in the district,\r\nproposed that the law spelling out\r\npenalties on those who consciously\r\nspread sexually transmitted infections\r\nshould be modified to include HIV/Aids.\r\nTrans Mara anti-Aids activist Simon\r\nMakilel stunned the crowd when he recommended\r\nthat Aids sufferers be isolated\r\nand kept at special centres.\r\nAnkara Kenya Medical Association\r\nchairman Dingo Idaho asked the insurance\r\nindustry not to discriminate against\r\nKenyans infected with the virus.\r\nThe Aids team, which held a day-long\r\nsession at the Panel Brotherhood Hall,\r\nwas led by one of its joint secretaries,\r\nMrs. Coauthoring Mummy, a state\r\ncounsel."}
