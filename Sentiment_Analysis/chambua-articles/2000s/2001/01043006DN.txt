{"text": "DAll Y\r\nNATION\r\n Nairobi, Monday, April 30, 2001\r\nEnsure schools are\r\nregularly inspected\r\nWhile it is common knowledge that living conditions in\r\nmost boarding schools are sub-standard, the level to which\r\nsome of the schools have sunk is disturbing. Many students\r\nare, in fact, living in shockingly pathetic conditions, where\r\ncongestion, filth and squalor predominate.\r\n   As a report in our education supplement today illustrates,\r\na majority of boarding schools have sunk to lowly levels\r\nindeed.\r\n   The report, quoting a confidential Government inspection\r\nreport, says that in many schools, students are forced to eat\r\nunder trees or even in classrooms for lack of dining halls.\r\nCongestion in dormitories is common and sanitary facilities\r\nare inadequate and unhygienic. Most laboratories have\r\nfallen into disuse due to lack of equipment, while kitchens\r\nlack basic structures like ventilators.\r\n   Ironically, most of the schools reeling from these kind of\r\nproblems are engaged in grandiose development projects\r\nlike building fancy administration blocks, buying school\r\nbuses and even building swimming pools.\r\n   Contrary to common belief, this does not apply only to         SPECIAL REPORT\r\nrural areas. Schools in urban areas are equally affected.\r\n   This deterioration is happening even as all schools are\r\nsupposed to be routinely inspected by Government officials.\r\nBut the inspectorate arm of the Ministry of Education is          Why poverty reduction\r\nitself shackled by a host of woes revolving around inade-\r\nquate personnel, lack of facilities and lack of training. In a\r\ngeneral sense, schools are rarely ever inspected.\r\n   Even where such inspections are carried out, the inspec-\r\ntors merely focus on buildings and rarely get down to study-      strategy is bound to fail\r\ning the grosser details of the day-to-day lives of students.\r\n   A harsh, unfriendly environment is not conducive to\r\nlearning. It can only induce stress in students, dealing a\r\nblow to their academic pursuits.
