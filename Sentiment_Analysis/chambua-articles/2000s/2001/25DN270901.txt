  Njoro town
  fouls its own
  water source
  By John Wahome
  Activities near Ndarugu Bridge on River Njoro -
  the main water source for most residents of Njoro
  Town - illustrate just how much dirt the public is
  taking. "Carwash" operators are strategically
  stationed near the river while water vendors drive
  their hapless donkeys right into the water. This
  combination leaves a slimy mixture of grease and
  dung in the water.
     A few meters away, residents wash clothes from
  the riverbanks. The water they use streams back
  freely into the river. Further downstream, another
  group of unsuspecting villagers will fetch this same
  water for domestic use.
     The main culprits in the pollution of the river are
  upstream, however. They are the extensive flower
  plantations near Egerton University whose regular
  use of pesticides has caused an alarming
  accumulation of chemical residues in the river.
     It has been claimed that these chemicals,
  together with phosphate and nitrate fertilizers used                                                                                                                                                               Photo/Joseph Gichuk
