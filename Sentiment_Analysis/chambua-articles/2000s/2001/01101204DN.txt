{"text": "\ufeffWE'LL FIGHT BACK, SAYS CHURCH\r\n\r\nBY GEORGE OMONSO AND AND DAVID MUGONYI\r\n\r\nThe Catholic Church and Muslim leaders\r\nyesterday vowed to fight any effort\r\nby the Government to encourage the use\r\nof condoms.\r\nThey said abstinence was the only\r\nmeans of fighting the spread of\r\nHIV /Aids.\r\nKitale Catholic Bishop Maurice Crowley,\r\nwho is also the .vice-chairma~ of the\r\neducation in the Church said the\r\nnational condom policy was not a solution,\r\nbut only a psychological position of\r\nsafety, an escape from reality ..\r\nElsewhere, the director of the Musltm\r\nConsultative Council, Mr Abdulrahaman\r\nWandati, said Islam does not condone\r\nsex outside marriage.\r\n\"Condoms and sex outside marriage is\r\nnot in our agenda. Wayward sex is an\r\nimpediment to going to Heaven,\" he\r\nsaid.\r\nCatholic Archbishop Ndingi Mwana\r\na'Nzeki and the chairman of the Kenya\r\nEpiscopal Conference, Rev John Njue,\r\nwere among the first to oppose the\r\nimportation of 300 million condoms. The\r\ntwo said it was a clear way of \"promoting\r\npromiscuity\".\r\nBishop Crowley asked the Government\r\nto strengthen guiding and counselling\r\nin schools to e.nable the youth lead\r\nupright and moral lives..\r\nThe cleric said the condom policy\r\nwould not be implemented in schools\r\nsponsored by the Church.\r\n\"We wonder why the Government\r\ndoes not consult other stakeholders like\r\nthe Catholic Church before passing such\r\npolicies,\" Bishop Crowl~y. said, adding\r\nthat it is only through gwdmg and cou~-\r\nselling that the war against the pandemlc\r\ncould be won.\r\nHe said to encourage condom use\r\namong the youths w~uld. be tan,tam01!nt\r\nto encouraging proIntsculty and creatmg\r\na false sense of safety. Besides, he added,\r\ncondoms were not 100 per cent\r\nperfect. .\r\nBut Anglican Archbish~p ~avld\r\nGitari said he will consult hiS bishops\r\nwhen the policy is published.\r\nControversial Kitale Catholic priest Fr\r\nGabriel Dolan described government's\r\nencouragement of the use of condoms as\r\n\"simplistic\", saying the use of condoms\r\nwould not solve the Aids problem.\r\nA day after the Govern~~nt\r\nannounced plans to import 300 mlllion\r\ncondoms, a group of youth~ d~monstrated\r\nin the streets of Nauobl and\r\nasked the authorities to utilise the\r\nmoney on programmes to enc01!rage\r\nKenyans to be of good moral behavIOur.\r\nThe programmes, the youth observed,\r\nshould include:\r\n\u2022 Erecting billboards promoting chastity\r\n(sexual self control) as the one and only\r\n100 per cent way of curbing the spread\r\nof HIV/Aids and other sexually transmitted\r\ninfections.\r\n\u2022 Promoting messages .in prin~ and\r\nbroadcast media encouragmg chastity\r\n\u2022 Support and encourage or~anisations\r\nand bodies that promote chastity\r\n\u2022 Enact strict laws to monitor and keep\r\npornography away from the youth."}
