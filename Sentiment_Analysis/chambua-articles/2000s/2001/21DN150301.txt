 The levels of depression among Aids           Depression the next big challenge in fight against scourge
 infected people is alarming, says a new
 report.
    A high proportion of these people are
 constantly contemplating suicide, while
 others adopt criminal or reckless behav-
 iour, not caring about their or others
 health or well-being.
    The depressions manifested in two
 main syndromes - self-hating and self-
pity -are impacting negatively on Aids
control programmes.
    "Among the symptoms shared by
both, suicidal thoughts and feeling no
interest in things appear to be predomi-
nant features of self-hate, whereas sad-
ness is more a feature of self-pity,"
observes Lincoln Ndogoni of World
Vision International.
    The study, Cross-clIltural Assessment
 of Trallma-Related Mental Illness. re-
 veals that Aids infected people suffering
 from these syndromes cry easily, feel
 lonely, worry too much about things,
 feel worthless, do not appreciative
assistance and are easily irritated even
over trivial matters. The study was con-
ducted by World Vision and the John
Hopkins University.
    Although there is such high levels of
depression among the Aids population,
this important problem in the manage-
ment of Aids is not usually recognised
as a distinct syndrome.       "The rate of
depression is as high as 24 per cent.
These rates of prevalence of depression
and suicidal tendencies or thoughts
among the population are very high and
warrant rapid intervention for these
respondents," appeals Mr Ndogoni.
    However, the biggest concern of the                An Aids awareness campaign. A new study shows that some attitudes among those depressed could negatively affect current prevention programmes.
researchers was the reckless attitude
among those infected. They fear that
this attitude that is even extended into       New Aids complications
their sexual activities could be the factor
behind the outbreaks of Aids infections
in certain regions.
    To the researchers, this attitude
among the depressed could affect lack
of amenability to behaviour change in         the counselling offered before the test or    scourge in many parts of the country.         77 per cent were females with men only        resulting from HIV in both the infected
