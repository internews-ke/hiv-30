FREE AIDS TESTS TO BE PROVIDED SOON

BY KIPKOECH TANUI
Free Aids testing centres will
soon be opened countrywide, the
government announced
yesterday.
The centres, which will also
offer free counselling on HIV,
are one of the measures being
introduced to encourage couples
planning to marry or have children
to first be tested for Aids in
a bid to curb infection.
The Director of Medical Services,
Dr Richard Muga, made the
announcement when opening a
one-day seminar at a Nairobi
hotel.
The DMS said the decision to
open free and voluntary counselling
and testing centres sprung
from study tours made by Ministry
of Health officials to Uganda,
where a similar course has been
adopted - leading to a tremendous
drop in HIV infection rates.
"Experience has shown that
whenever one knows his or her
HN status, especially if one is
uninfected, one's capacity to be
cautious and avoid contracting the
disease shoots up," said Dr Muga.
Health Minister Sam Ongeri, in
a speech read by Assistant Minister
Guracha Galgalo, admitted
that Kenya's population increase
and demand for health care has
outstripped the government's
ability to provide effective services
to control diseases.
He appealed to the media to
change the sexual behaviour of
the people. Those who spoke
included a representative of the
World Health Organisation, Dr
Peter Eriki, and the director of the
Kenya Medical Research Institute,
Dr Davy Koech. Dr Koech is
one of the leading local researchers
working to develop Aids cures
and vaccines ..
He urged the media to give
health matters priority by "creating
and transmitting messages
which have the power to make
people acquire new skills. and
make rational decisions concerning
their health".
The chairman of the National
Aids Control Council, Dr Ibrahim
Mohammed, said the government
has put in place a policy that
seeks to reduce HIV prevalence
among people aged 15-24 years.
In the next five years, the government
hopes to give improved
care and support for the infected
people. The national capacity and
coordination to respond to HN/
Aids at all levels will also be
refined.
The strategy is multi-sectoral
in approach and targets key sectors
such as education, agriculture,
industry and health.
He announced that the Public
Service Commission will recruit
coordinators to take charge of
recently formed Aids control
units. Interviews have already
been conducted for and the new
.employees are expected to be
deployed in a month's time.
Similar positions at provincial
and district levels will be filled
by November.
