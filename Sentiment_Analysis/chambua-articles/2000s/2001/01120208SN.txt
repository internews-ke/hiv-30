Unlike in the past four\r\n        erhaps, one of the most encouraging developments in the fight\r\nP       against the Aids pandemic, is the openness with which many\r\nAids in their countries, many governments now readily provide statis-\r\nto five years, when some were even reluctant to admit the existence of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     RAIG\u00a3 YOUR UANDS ..\u2022\r\ntics.\r\n   The numbers are important as they show the extent and enormity of\r\nthe problem. The World Aids Day, marked yesterday, provided a per-\r\nfect opportunity, once again, to reflect on this global menace. Sadly, the\r\nlatest statistics confirm that Aids is increasingly becoming the number\r\none health problem in the poverty-ravaged sub-Saharan Africa.\r\n   According to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/Aids, of\r\nthe 3 million deaths worldwide, this year, 2.3 million occurred in this\r\nregion. This is an area where the majority not only lack access to basic\r\nmedical care, but hardly have enough food, shelter and other basic\r\nnecessities. Whereas in the developing nations, access to anti-Aids\r\ndrugs helps to prolong the lives of sufferers, in Africa, the majority poor\r\ncannot afford even such simple and cheap drugs as Aspirin.\r\n   As the cure for Aids remains elusive despite intensified research at\r\ngovernmental and other levels, and access to retro-viral drugs remains\r\nout of reach for the majority, alternative strategies must be relentlessly\r\npursued.
