'\r\n      The latest financial report on the once-profitable and highly\r\n   efficient power distribution utility makes depressing reading.\r\n      The bottom line is that an already cash-strapped\r\n  Government is being forced to bail out a corporation which, if\r\n  it were not a monopoly offering such essential services, would\r\n  otherwise have been left to sink (or swim).\r\n     We have heard a litany of excuses for KPLC's poor results,\r\n  such as prolonged drought and power rationing. But these are\r\n  just that - excuses.\r\n     If the KPLC were run like a private company, there is no\r\n  doubt, the management would be having to answer a lot of\r\n  hard questions from the board of directors. The board would,\r\n  in turn, be squirming in front of irate shareholders.\r\n     Not so, in this case. The KPLC is supposed to be a public\r\n  company. It is quoted on the Nairobi Stock Exchange. Yet it\r\n  is run and managed just like any other parastatal. That is\r\n  because the Government holds the controlling shares. And\r\n  so it prefers to exercise absolute control by appointing a pliant\r\n  board and politically correct senior management.\r\n     As a mere public trustee, the Government should be in the\r\n  forefront in demanding minimum, if not maximum,\r\n  performance by the management and the board. Instead the\r\n  takes it upon itself to proffer all manner of excuses for the\r\n  company's poor performance.
