It is that Kenyans - a whole 40 of them\r\n- died quite needlessly from a typhoid outbreak at Embu\r\nrecently.\r\n   What was the matter? According to the experts taking\r\npart in the teach-in: at the lakeside town of Kisumu on\r\nFriday, the tragedy was a result of a testing method called                                                                                                                                                                                 j\r\nWidal, widely used in Government health institutions.\r\n   Apparently, Widal yields information that is often false.\r\nIt indicates negative where other, more reliable, methods                                                                                                                                                                                   I\r\nindicate positive, thus misleading medical workers into pre-\r\nscribing the wrong medicine, occasioning severe infections\r\nand, not infrequently, death.\r\n   The Kenya Medical Association's annual scientific con-\r\nference - attended by experts from\" Uganda, Tanzania,\r\nRwanda and as far afield as South Africa and India -\r\nheard that Widal tests remained popular for detecting sal-\r\nmonella thyphi, the bacterium which causes typhoid, even\r\nafter many local doctors had raised this matter with the\r\nministry.\r\n   Said Dr J. K. Muraguri: \"We have recommended to the\r\nHealth Ministry to ban Widal testing. And it is now up to it      NEWS ANALYSIS\r\nto act. In the Embu case, there was a lot of confusion since\r\nit was compounded by malarial parasites in the victims.\"\r\n   What the doctor implies here - a point enunciated by\r\nby Government doctors.\r\nProf Ochola Odeng - is that the testing of typhoid at\r\nEmbu, because it was not thorough enough to include a .
