It is a powerful\r\n  statement, especially in view of the underlying reference to\r\n  death and destruction. For us in Kenya, the statistics point to\r\n between 600 to 700 deaths daily due to HIV/Aids.\r\n     And this may be just i:he best-case scenario, for all we\r\n know. Record-keeping has never been our forte, and there\r\n are probably thousands of Aids victims who are never\r\n acknowledged, and sufferers who have not had the benefit\r\n of HIV testing.\r\n     What we do know is that, far from being the obscure\r\n illness it was in the 1980s, we are beginning to see villages\r\n being closed down, children bringing up fellow children,\r\n and the elderly being forced to play the role of parents twice\r\n over. It is a tragedy of proportions so devastating that the\r\n notion that it is still in its early stages must strike fear deep\r\n in the hearts of survivors of this illness normally compared\r\n with the plague.\r\n    The burden to the health delivery system, education and\r\n the entire economy has been enormous; so has the emo-\r\n tional cost of the disease.\r\n    The fundamental question at this point, however, is               COMMENT ARY\r\n whether the statement by UNAIDS Executive Director Peter\r\n Piot is powerful enough to jolt Kenyans into changing their\r\n there are still indications that we are not moving fast enough\r\n lifestyles and adopting health practices that will turn the tide\r\n on the epidemic.                                                    What is your actual\r\n    Kenya may have declared Aids a national disaster, but\r\n to mobilise support for those living with HIV/Aids and\r\n will have to invest much more in scaling up those projects if\r\n heading off new infections.\r\n    In a sense, a great deal of effort has gone into projects to     stand, Mr President?\r\n support families affected by HIV/Aids. But the Government\r\n the next generation of Kenyans is not to be wiped out.\r\n    We have seen sufficient evidence in the recent past that         Britons go to the polls on Thursday to                                                         to hold their horses.\r\n humanitarian aid will only be accorded to those nations that        elect - there's no need for a fortune-teller                                                      You can remove the uncertainty, Mr\r\n demonstrate a clear political will to find meaningful solu-         here - Tony Blair's Labour Party for yet                                                       President, by telling us whethet or not\r\n tions to the various moral and social bottlenecks that have         another term.                                                                                  you intend to cling on to power.\r\n dogged the HlV/Aids debate.
