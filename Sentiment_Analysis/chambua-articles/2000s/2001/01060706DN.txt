{"text": "  6\r\n  DAIL Y\r\n  NATION\r\n      Nairobi, Thursday, June 7, 2001\r\n  Visionary Dlove on\r\n  the Maasai Mara\r\n   The Trans Mara County Council has made a bold and\r\n   visionary move by turning over its section of the Maasai\r\n  Mara Game Reserve to a non-profit foundation to manage.\r\n      But no sooner had the ink dried on the signature on the\r\n  renewable five-year agreement with the Mara Conservancy\r\n  than some civic leaders cried foul.\r\n, Such a reaction should probably have been expected, but\r\n  it is not the kind of initiative that should be reduced to\r\n  ill-informed political wrangling.\r\n     The councillors opposed to the arrangement may well\r\n  have some valid points. But they failed to present a cogent\r\n  argument after travelling all the way from Kilgoris to\r\n  address a press conference in Nairobi yesterday. Instead,\r\n  they resorted to baseless accusations and wild finger-\r\n pointing.\r\n     No one in his right mind would deny that the wider\r\n Maasai Mara National Reserve has been grossly misman-\r\n aged through the years. The old Narok County Council,\r\n before Trans Mara District was created, should have been\r\n one of the richest local authorities in the country. But mil-\r\n lions of shillings in revenue were diverted by greedy local\r\n leaders.\r\n     In the end, the Maasai Mara was reduced to no more than       COMMENTARY\r\n a declining cash-cow ready for blatant milking by which-\r\n ever political faction happened to be on the ascendancy. It\r\n also became the battleground for vicious fights between           Aids has come of age,\r\n contending interests.\r\n     The drama a few years ago when Dr Richard Leakey was\r\n hounded out of the Kenya Wildlife Service had something.\r\n to do with his desire to take over and introduce profession-\r\n alism and honesty in running the Mara.                            but does anyone care?\r\n     A few years later, there was yet another vicious battle\r\n when communities outside the reserve's boundaries, but\r\n within the Mara-Serengeti ecosystem, realised they could\r\n run their own tourist facilities - and benefit directly from                                                                                                                                            I\r\n the accruing revenue.
