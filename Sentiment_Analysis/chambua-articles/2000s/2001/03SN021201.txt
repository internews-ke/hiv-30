TEARS AS VICTIMS TELL OF HARDSHIPS
BY MIKE MWANIKI

Thousands of wananchi and dignitaries
were yesterday moved to tears by
testimonies of people living with Aids.
Speaking at the Nyayo National
Stadium, Nairobi, the group of 14
men and women led by Ms Inviolata
Mmbwavi gave heart-rending stories
of the hardships they faced as they
tried to cope with the killer virus.
The carnival-like atmosphere that
had earlier prevailed at the World
Aids Day commemoration at the stadium
was shattered after the group
took to the dais and gave their
testimonies.
Ms Mmbwavi said: "We are still
facing discrimination in our society.
People have not stopped blaming
us.... We are tired of people pointing
fingers at us...."
The function was attended by the
National Aids Control Council chairman,
Dr Mohammed Abdalla, NACC
director, Dr Margaret Gachara,
Unicef and World Health Organisation
country representatives, Dr
Nicholas Alipui and Dr Peter Eriki
respectively.
Others were US ambassador Johnnie
Carson, Deputy British High
Commissioner Paul Harvey, Nairobi
deputy mayor Cllr Joe Aketch and
UNAids official Warren Namara. Out
of Nairobi's eight Members of Parliament,
only Dagoretti MP Beth Mugo
attended.
Women Fighting Aids in Kenya
(Wofak) Executive director, Ms Dorothy
Onyango, appealed to the Government
to provide cheaper anti-Aids
drugs to those infected.
Dr Alipui said the key factors contributing
to the high incidence of Aids
infection, especially among the youth
in Kenya, were poverty, a fatalistic
attitude and "Iegitimisation of multipartner
relationships".
The stadium was awash with a sea
of humanity dressed in yellow T-shirts
and caps embossed with this year's
slogan "I Care, Do You". A Kenya
Air Force plane sporting a banner
with the same words hovered
overhead. At another function at
the Department of Defence in Nairobi,
the Association of People with
Aids in Kenya Executive,Director, Mr
Rowlands G. Lenya, cautioned that
people with HIV/Aids are not necessarily
thin.
Mr Lenya, a tall heavily built man;
told members of the Armed Forces
that it was a misconception that peo'
pie with HIV/Aids looked emaciated
and sickly.
"Look at me. I am fatter than most
of you yet I am HIV-positive," Mr
Lenya told the gathering during a
function organised by the Armed
Forces to to mark the World Aids
Day.
Mr Lenya told the soldiers that
HIV/Aids was more dangerous than
guns. "When you go to war, you alone
might get killed. But if you use your
other gun wrongly it could kill your
wife, yourself and members of your
family," Mr Lenya said.
