Since\r\npoverty has been identified as a major\r\ncontributor to the spread of Aids, the\r\nUN should create programmes to\r\nattract specific funding to help alleviate\r\nthe rasping poverty at the grassroots\r\nlevel, where a majority live.\u201d\r\nProf Ongen was receiving the visiting\r\nUN envoy for Africa, Mr Stephen\r\nLewis, in the minister\u2019s Afya House\r\noffice, Nairobi.\r\nThe function was attended, among\r\nothers, by (JNAids country\r\nrepresentative Warren Naamara,\r\nHealth Permanent Secretary Julius\r\nMeme and Director of Medical Services\r\nRichard Muga.\r\nMr Lewis, who is also a special envoy\r\nof UN secretary-general Kofi Annan, is\r\non a fact-finding mission in Kenya and\r\nother black African countries home\r\nto 25.3 million people living with Aids\u2014\r\nto see how they are coping with the\r\nkiller. He said a global Aids fund\r\nspearheaded by Mr Annan would start\r\nto disburse cash by December.\r\nLast month, Mr Annan said that\r\nbctwecn $7 and $10 billion was needed\r\nannually to halt Aids and reverse its\r\neffects. Rich Western countries and\r\npoor Aids-afflicted African nations\r\nannounced new contributions to the\r\nglobal Aids fund that Mr Annan wants.\r\nMr Lewis said: \u201cThe global fund will\r\nhelp in resource mobilisation to fight\r\nI\u0161JVlAids, especially in developing\r\ncountries, the hardest hit.\u201d\r\nDonations accepted\r\nDr Muga said the Government had\r\naccepted a donation of HIV/Aids drugs\r\nfrom a German-based pharmaceutical\r\ncompany, Boehringer Ingelheim.\r\nThe firm\u2019s free offer of Nevirapme\r\nwould help reduce mother-to-child\r\ntransmissions by about 50 per cent, he\r\nadded.\r\n\u201cAlthough the offer is welcome, we\r\nneed to address the plight of mothers\r\nand fathers infected by the HIV virus,\r\n\u201cIt is a moral and pertinent issue\r\nsince a child\u2019s health is as important as\r\nthe mother\u2019s or father\u2019s,\u201d he said.\r\nMeanwhile, Prof Ongeri dismissed\r\npress reports that the Kenya Aids\r\nVaccine Initiative (KAVI) project was\r\nfacing a \u201ccrisis\u201d after a senior\r\nresearcher resigned recently.\r\nl-le said: \u201cThe researcher resigned for\r\npersonal reasons. However, the\r\nproject\u2019s protocols and methodology\r\nare intact since they do not hinge on a\r\nsingle person.\u201d\r\n\r\nMEDICS SOUND ALERTS ON QUACKS\r\n\r\nBy Sunday Nation Correspondent\r\nEighty per cent of Nakuru's pharmacists\r\nare quacks, the Central Rift Pharmaceutical\r\nSociety claim.\r\nThe branch officials also urge drug\r\ncompanies to ensure Aids drugs are\r\naffordable and available in every part of\r\nthe country.\r\nSpeaking to the Press when he\r\nlaunched a drugs awareness campaign\r\non Friday, the officials - Dr Heina\r\nMaina (treasurer), Dr Paul Tanui (secretary)\r\nand Dr Mburu Ndue - said that,\r\ndespite the society's efforts to purge the\r\nprofession of quacks, many were still in\r\nbusiness.\r\nThey urged the public to seek the services\r\nof qualified pharmacists all the time.\r\nThe branch has introduced a mark, the\r\ngreen cross, to help identify genuine\r\npharmacists.\r\nThey said that, despite the drop in the\r\nAids drugs prices, they could be bought\r\nonly in Nairobi.\r\nDrug companies and the Government\r\nshould ensure they are available in other\r\nparts of the country, they said.\r\nThe pharmacists, they said, would visit\r\ninstitutions and other public places to\r\ncreate awareness on drugs and their\r\nproper use as well as distribute free\r\nmedicines."}
