{"text": "\ufeffDAILY NATION, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 2001\r\n\r\nMEN WHO HAVE BEEN MAKING A KILLING FROM THE BEREAVED ARE OUT OF WORK\r\nWIDOW INHERITORS MEET THEIR MATCH\r\n\r\nBy CLAY MUGANDA Monica is not a popular\r\nname in some circles of\r\nUkwala in Siaya District.\r\nAmong the more traditional\r\nof the menfolk, Monica is not\r\njust a woman's name, It represents a\r\nflood sweeping away the stilts of tradition\r\nfrom under their society,\r\nSt Monica Women's Group, an antiwidow\r\ninheritance advocacy association,\r\nis also threatening the livelihood\r\nof a rare type of professional.\r\n\"We have no choice but to turn back\r\nto our shambas as these people have\r\ncut off our source of livelihood,\"\r\nlaments Jack Adero, a widow\r\ninheritor.\r\nAdero, 57 and unmarried, used to\r\nget paid for his services before the\r\nrytonica group came into being. His\r\nfuties then entailed /oko ot (building a ceremonial hut for the widow) and\r\nspending a night with her in the\r\nnewly-built hut.\r\n; The jotero . or professional widow\r\ninheritors, can demand up to\r\nSh 15,000, plus cattle, to cleanse a\r\nwidow.\r\nAmong the Luo, who predominantly\r\noccupy the area, it is taboo for\r\nan un-inherited widow to enter anyone's\r\nhomestead. If she does, she is\r\nnot allowed to enter any of the houses\r\nin the compound.\r\nShould a widow die \u00b7before being\r\ninherited, her brothers-in-law are\r\nbarred by custom from digging her\r\ngrave. They are also barred from\r\nbuilding another dwelling for her\r\nshould the one her husband left her\r\ncollapse. These beliefs bar close relatives\r\nfrom helping widows who\r\nchoose not to be inherited.\r\nMost jotero sponge on well-to-do\r\nwidows. Adero admits that jotero take\r\nadvantage of this ritual to pitch camp\r\nin the widow's homestead -- at her\r\nexpense. Thus their resentment for\r\nMonica.\r\nThe group has been filling the void\r\nleft by relatives who desert uninherited\r\nwidows for fear of offending\r\ncustom and tradition.\r\n\"Had it not been for Monica, I could\r\nhave perished during the E/ Nino\r\nrains,\" says Agnes Abonyo, the\r\ngroup's co-chairman. \"My husband\r\nleft me in a crumbling hut as our\r\nresources had been spent on his medication.\r\nMy brothers-in-law regarded\r\nme as an outcast after I refused to be\r\ninherited and would not come to my\r\nrcscue,\" she says.\r\nThe group built a hut for her.\r\nMonica, which was initially associated\r\nwith older widows when it started\r\nofTwith 15 members, is now attracting\r\nyoung [Christian) widows and even\r\nmen. Of the 254 members, 68 are\r\nmale.\r\nMary Amollo, the group's chairman,\r\nsays membership is open to\r\nChristians, and not necessarily\r\nwidows.\r\n\"Surprisingly, men started joining\r\nas tim..: went by,\" says Amollo. \"This\r\nhas increased the membership to\r\ninclude widowers who also dislike the\r\ncleansing rituals they go through when\r\nthey lose their wives,\" she adds.\r\nInitially, widows were ridiculed by\r\ntraditionalists, but the group has defied\r\nall the odds to step in and help members\r\nprotect their propcrty and stave off harassment\r\nfrom \"professional\" inheritors.\r\nBertha Anyango, 62, confesses that\r\nshe joined Monica because she could\r\nnot stand the idea of another man in her\r\nlife.\r\n\"Some of these inheritors are drunks\r\nand spread malicious rumours about\r\none's family when their demands are\r\nnot met,\" says the grandmother of four.\r\nShe was widowed in 1996.\r\nMonica's efforts in curbing widow\r\ninheritance have curtailed inheritors'\r\nbehaviour of reaping where they did not\r\nsow, says Charles Odhiambo, a Busiabased\r\npoliceman whose father died early\r\nthis month. He says: \"As much as I\r\nwould not like to interfere with my\r\nmother's life, I will not stand any goodfor-\r\nnothing old man trying to interfere\r\nwith her Iife just because she is\r\nwidowed.\"\r\nBut it has not been smooth sailing for\r\nMonica. Some of the group's fiercest\r\ncritics have been women whose\r\ndaughters-in-law joined Monica. They\r\naccuse the Monica women of brainwashing\r\nyoung widows in order to get\r\ntheir unmarried brothers to marry them.\r\nSupporters of inheritance say the group\r\nis responsible for the runaway spread of\r\nHIV/Aids in the region.\r\n\"It is better to be inherited and infect\r\none person than to refuse and keep a\r\nstring of boyfriends who could all end\r\nup getting infected,\" observes Owit\r\nLuoland, a professional inheritor who\r\nwas expelled from the division.\r\nOwiti earned the Luoland name\r\nbecause of his widow-inheritance\r\nexploits in distant areas when Monica's\r\nclout made Ukwala ajotero-free area.\r\nWith its continued popularity, Monica\r\nnow admits even couples as members.\r\nMembership is free, but during the\r\nweekly meeting-cum-prayer sessions,\r\neach member contributes at least Sh20\r\nfor a rainy day.\r\n\"Considering the level of poverty\r\nhere, we cannot peg the amount higher\r\nas most of our members are either\r\nunemployed or are only petty traders,\"\r\nsays Sabina Odipo, the group's\r\ntreasurer.\r\nOne in every two people in Siaya cannot\r\nafford a meal a day, according to the\r\nFirst Report on Poverty in Kenya. More\r\nthan half of the women are absolutely\r\npoor. II The district has a large number of\r\nfemale-headed households and most\r\nwomen are illiterate. Because of cultural\r\ninhibitions, women cannot make important\r\ndecisions. Their participation in big\r\nbusiness ventures is greatly hampered,\r\nfurther worsening their poverty.\r\nOdipo says that despite all the hardships\r\nthey could face, the group has to\r\nstay because \"widow inheritance has\r\nbeen abused and has no place in the\r\nmodem societv and in the era of HIV/\r\nAids. We are trying to prevent the\r\nspread of the scourge by encouraging\r\nyoung widows to join us and shun the\r\njotero,\" she adds.\r\n\"Widow inheritance involving sexual\r\nacts is very risky in the district, where\r\nthe HIV-prevalence is higher than the\r\nnational average,\" warns Tom Onyango,\r\nthe Siaya District Aids and STD Coordinator.\r\nOne in every three people in Siaya is\r\nbelieved to be infected with HIV,\r\naccording to statistics at the local district\r\nhospital.\r\nOnyango says that even when widows\r\nconsent to be inherited for cultural reasons,\r\ninheritors still insist on sexual\r\nrelations.\r\nLuo women, two-year study by\r\nKenya Oral Literature Association and).');\r\nInterlink Rural Information service'Mfeel '\";o,,,I!\r\nthat widow inheritance is larg\r\nresponsible for the escalating sprea\r\nHIV/Aids. As a cultural practice, it h\r\nbeen compromised by the increase in\r\nsexually transmitted infections and has\r\n. therefore outl ived its usefulness.\r\nThe study says that widows view\r\ntheir economic situation as tragic since\r\nthey cannot provide adequate care, food\r\nclothing and school fees for their children\r\nas they should only be inherited if\r\nthe sole aim is providing a solution to\r\ntheir economic hardship.\r\nThe widow inheritors hardly fit in the\r\n13.1 per cent bracket of rural men who\r\nknow about HIV/Aids and have ever\r\nbeen tested. The 1998 Kenya Demographic\r\nand Health Survey states that in\r\nNyanza Province, 63.3 per cent of the\r\nmen know about condoms while only\r\n16.7 per cent are willing to pay (a maximum\r\nof Sh5) for them."}
