{"text": "\ufeffDAILY NATION, WEDNESDAY, MAY 30, 2001\r\n\r\nRwandan widows face slow-motion genocide\r\n\r\nBy William Maclean\r\nSeven years on, history's fastest\r\ngenocide reaps a slow-motion\r\nharvest of death.\r\nJeanette Uwimane lost her husband\r\nand five children in the 100-\r\nday slaughter of 800,000 minority\r\nTutsis and moderate Hutus in\r\n1994.\r\nHutu extremist killers stuffed\r\nthe small corpses of the children\r\ninto a pit latrine, then subjected\r\nher to repeated rape as a sex\r\nslave.\r\nShe contracted the HIV virus\r\nthat causes AIDS, and now her\r\nailing body is a daily reminder\r\nthat the evil which destroyed her\r\nfamily will one day reach out\r\nfrom history for a final\r\nreckoning.\r\nA photograph on a table in her\r\nsmall single-storey house shows\r\nUwimane in happier times, a vigorous\r\nyoung woman wearing an\r\namused expression and a spectacular\r\nAfro hairstyle.\r\nAt 39 she remains beautiful but\r\nis a shrunken figure. Lesions\r\ncover her arms. She can flash a\r\nbrilliant smile, but in quiet\r\nmoments she tells visitors it\r\nmasks her true emotions.\r\n\"Y ou see my smile. But\r\ninwardly I am suffering,\" she\r\nsays.\r\nLike thousands of other AIDSinfccted\r\ngenocide widows, she\r\nwants to tell her story in a court\r\nof law before she weakens further,\r\nto help render justice and\r\npossibly hasten long-awaited\r\ncompensation for the two of her\r\nchildren that survived.\r\nBut it is a race against time as\r\nthe trials of accused killers\r\nremain slow and disease spreads\r\nthrough her body.\r\nUwimane is one of 25,000\r\nmembers of the A VEGAAGAHOZO,\r\nan association of\r\ngenocide widows who have\r\nbanded together to try to survive\r\ndcspite a host of genocide-related\r\nailments.\r\nBereft of organised medical\r\ncare, the widows are also ravaged\r\nby a range of other\r\nsexually-transmitted diseases\r\ncaused by rape. Some sufTer a\r\nhost of untreated infections, internal\r\ndisorders, and disabilities\r\ncaused by deep machete wounds.\r\nLike most, Uwimane gets no\r\ntreatment for AIDS as she ekes\r\nout her life in a ramshackle village\r\nbuilt by AVEGA with the\r\nhelp of foreign donors near the\r\ncapital Kigali.\r\nThe settlement of 185 houses is\r\nunfinished and has no power or\r\nrunning water because Rwandan\r\nstate funding has temporarily run\r\nout. The women walk five km\r\n(three miles) to plots to grow\r\nfood and fetch water, but some\r\nare too weak to make the journey.\r\nOther survivors live in total\r\ndestitution in urban areas, with\r\nmany afraid to return to their villages\r\nbecause their homes are\r\ndestroyed or they suspect some\r\nkillers remain at liberty ..\r\nUwimane reflects on the regular\r\nmeals and medical attention\r\nenjoyed by the accused masterminds\r\nof the massacres awaiting\r\ntrial in a modem prison at a U.N.\r\ntribunal in Arusha, Tanzania.\r\nThose who have comfort are\r\nin Arusha,\" she says with a wistful\r\nsmile. \"The international community\r\nprefers to give aid to the\r\ndetained people, not to the\r\nsurvivors.\"\r\nMedicines to prolong her life --\r\nwhich could cost $280 a month --\r\nis unimaginably costly, says\r\nAVEGA official Sylvia Barakagwira\r\nwho lost her husband in the\r\nmassacres.\r\nShe said an AVEGA study of\r\n925 genocide widows found twothirds\r\nwere HIV-positive and 80\r\npercent were traumatised by the\r\nloss of loved ones and gang\r\nrapes. None have received any\r\nform of compensation from a\r\ngovernl:lent bereft of resources.\r\n\"No single survivor has got\r\nany compensation,\" she said.\r\n\"The government says compensation\r\nshould not be on an\r\nindividual basis, but the widows\r\nwill all be dead by the time they\r\nset up an alternative programme.\"\r\nTo the widows, conditions for\r\nreconciliation do not exist.\r\n\"When you see killers all\r\naround, and those killers have not\r\nconfessed, and politicians make\r\nspeeches about the need for reconciliation,\r\nthen this is hard for\r\nus,\" Barakagwira said.\r\n\"Reconciliation can come only\r\nfrom justice.\"\r\nThe genocidc destroyed the\r\nnormally powerful self-help\r\nmechanism of the African\r\nextended family, leaving widows\r\nbereft of help with the unfamiliar\r\ntask of tending fields and growing\r\ncrops.\r\nThe widows are grateful to\r\ntheir government for providinl!\r\nsecurity in the country -- and\r\ndeploying guards for the village\r\nafter locals from nearby settlements\r\nidentified the widows as a\r\nsoft target and began stealing\r\nfrom their homes.\r\nFeelings can run high when\r\nforeigners come to visit.\r\nWidows ask visitors about how\r\nthey are portrayed in European\r\ntelevision documentaries, and are\r\ncurious about the feelings that\r\ninspire people in rich countries to\r\ngive aid.\r\n\"You must not see us as if we\r\nare mountain gorillas,\" said genocide\r\nwidow Marie Bahizi.\r\n\"We are not a tourist attraction.\r\nWe are living an unbearable life.\"\r\n(Reuters)"}
