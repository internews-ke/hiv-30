prominent members of the Bench, especially when the
language used turns out to be loaded with tar and innuendo.
   While we cannot go into the specifics of the case in which
Mr Justice Richard Kwach accused two of his colleagues, Mr
A.B. Shah, and Mr Philip Tonui, of suspect behaviour by
disallowing an appeal they had earlier agreed should go on, it
is astonishing that the learned judges would not conduct the
affair with decorum, even allowing for the need to air the
issue publicly.
    We are not in a position to pass judgment on the merits of
the case, but we take exception to the base language used in
the altercation.
    Nevertheless,   since the matter is now out, we support the
Law Society of Kenya in their call to Chief Justice Bernard
 Chunga and to President Moi to set up a tribunal that would
 investigate the whole sorry incident, and many others that,
 presumably, do not come to public limelight.              _
    Kenyans would, for instance, want to know exactly what
prompted a judge of Mr Justice Kwach's calibre to call for
action "to redeem the reputation of the Court of Appeal".
    They would also like to be told why Mr Justice Tunoi
believes his colleague was only seeking cheap publicity and
