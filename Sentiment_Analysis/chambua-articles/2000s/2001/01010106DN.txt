But it is also criminal for\r\n      senior police officers to make good public threats to harm the\r\n      very same citizens they have been employed to protect.\r\n           What we saw when chaos broke out at the Mbo-i-Kamiti\r\n      meeting last Saturday can hardly qualify to ,be part of the\r\n      peace-keeping duties that Chief Inspector Musoso and his. tea~\r\n      of officers were sent to perform. They were there to maIntaIn\r\n      law and order. Instead, we saw the all-too-familiar face of\r\n      thugs in uniform. So brazen have these criminals become that\r\n      they do not even bother to hide their faces.\r\n           Not only is it on record that an inspector identified as K!ilu\r\n      threatened to kill Ms Dindi, but she WliStargeted for a beatIng\r\n      by officers who pursued her through, a coffee plantation and\r\n      threatened to flush her out of a farmhouse with teargas.\r\n           And all this as violence reigned supreme among troubled\r\n       shareholders. Indeed, the police appeared to have clearly set\r\n      their sights on Ms Dindi and the Nation Media Group in\r\n      particular.                         ....\r\n           We at the Nation demand ImmedIate actl.Qn from Pohce\r\n      Commissioner Philemon Abong'o. As citizens of this country,\r\n      our reporters have every right. to pursue their duties without\r\n      fear of attack by policemen or anyone else who has an axe to               NEWS ANALYSIS\r\n      grind against the media.\r\n           Indeed, this is not the first time that journalists have been\r\n      assaulted. We have seen reporters and photographers kid-\r\n       napped and whipped.          Others have had theIr equipment             Virginity testing' gets,\r\n       destroyed.
