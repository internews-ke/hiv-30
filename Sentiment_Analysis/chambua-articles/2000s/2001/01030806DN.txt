Women remain disadvantaged in\r\nnumerous ways. In education, more girls than boys drop out\r\n of school for cultural, social and economic reasons and end\r\nup living in misery. Of the 41 million Af1-icanchildren not in\r\nschool, 56 per cent are girls.\r\n    For this and other reasons, even fewer women join profes-\r\nsional careers, like medicine, engineering and law. which\r\npromise       higher   economic     rewards     and leadership\r\nronmental degradation.
