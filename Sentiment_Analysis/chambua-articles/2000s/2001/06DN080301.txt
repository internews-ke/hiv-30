out of the woods yet
Today, the world celebrates the International Women's Day,
 an annual occasion on which women's achievements and
 challenges in a male-dominated world are appraised.
   There is no disputing that the campaign for gender equity
 in all walks of life has yielded a great deal since 1976, when
 the United Nations declared March 8 the International Wom-
 en's Day.
   But, both locally and internationally, there is a great deal of
unfinished business yet in matters affecting women.
   Take Africa's case. Women remain disadvantaged in
numerous ways. In education, more girls than boys drop out
 of school for cultural, social and economic reasons and end
up living in misery. Of the 41 million Af1-icanchildren not in
school, 56 per cent are girls.
    For this and other reasons, even fewer women join profes-
sional careers, like medicine, engineering and law. which

opportunities.                                                                                                -
