{"text": "\ufeffDaily Nation! Wednesday, October 10, 2001\r\n\r\nCONTINUED FROM PAGE 1\r\nTRAPPED INTO A POISONOUS UNION\r\n\r\nshe married, she says: \"When we met, I thought I was safe with him.\"\r\nNow, she was learning otherwise.\r\n\"I had seen that he was reckless and challenged him about his lifestyle.\r\nI told him I knew he was infected with some terrible disease then\r\ninformed him that I was going to be tested, and if I was HlV positive, I\r\nwould go public to expose him and save the many women he took\r\nadvantage of.\"\r\nIt is one thing to suspect that you may be HlV positive. It is quite\r\nanother to be told to your face by your sexual partner of 12 months that\r\nhe was HIV positive when he met you.\r\n\"Yes, when I married you I had it (HlV). Were you blind not to\r\nsee?\" he asked, rubbing salt into her wounds.\r\nShe realised she was just a statistic on his scorecard of victims. \"I was\r\nbitter and cried for a long time.\"\r\n\"That night,\" Atieno continues, \"he beat me. He\r\nbeat me hard and brutally, then packed up and left me\r\nlying on a cold floor, bleeding, alone with my\r\ndaughter.\"\r\nIt is a poor neighbourhood, and when her husband\r\nleft her carrying their bed, their paraffin stove, their\r\nkitchen utensils, his clothes and hers, Atieno had nothingleft.\r\nShe was hurt and could not move. A neighbour\r\nlooked in and helped her to a health centre, where her\r\nwounds were dressed before she went to report her\r\nassault to the police post in Kinyango, Dandora.\r\nThe injuries of her last night with her husband still\r\nweigh Atieno down. She cannot work any more,\r\nbecause her neck cannot take the long hours of stand- /\r\ning as she plaits customers' hair. \u2022\u2022\r\nHer chest still aches and she has a rapture in one of LAUGHTER: Mr Klmanthl\r\nher eardrums. The X-ray examination confirmed to her\r\nthat the end of her working life had come.\r\nThe police were forthright, and asked her if she wanted him taken to\r\ncourt and charged, or if she preferred to get her things back first. She\r\nwas desperate, caring for a four-year-old child, and with nowhere to\r\nturn. She chose to have the stove, the bed, and the clothes first.\r\nSo when the police pursued the man to his workplace, he released\r\nthe things she needed to survive. He was freed, perhaps with the expectation\r\nthat the couple would sort out the assault case Kenyan style -\r\nby ignoring it.\r\nAtieno's husband made friendly overtures, first sending emissaries to\r\nsee her, and then going to see Atieno's relatives about a reconciliation.\r\nYet, in her mind, his admission replayed like a stuck record: \"Yes, I\r\nknew I had Aids and that I was going to die but that it would be after\r\n10 years. What I did I knew and I am still going to do it to someone else\r\njust like I did to you.\"\r\nShe knew that she had to find out the truth for herself. She went to\r\nhospital for an Aids test. The first test result at the Kenyatta National\r\nHospital was positive ..\r\n\"My first thought was 'I don't want to die!'\" Atieno remembers. She\r\nwent for re-testing at the Kenya Medical Research Institute, and the\r\ntruth would not change. It was time to start accepting reality, but all the\r\npre-test and post-test counselling could not prepare her for the shock\r\nshe had to deal with.\r\n\"When I got that result, I bought many tablets [two varieties of\r\nover-the-counter drugs] and took them, intending to die. I fell into a\r\ndeep sleep and heard a voice telling me to go for payers.\"\r\n\"For a long time, I was in denial. I was too young to have Aids, but I\r\nalso had the test result that said I was infected. I joined the church for\r\nencouragement.\"\r\nIn the tough Dandora district, where vice and religion thrive side by\r\nside, being sick, unemployed and with a child can be a heavy burden.\r\nBut Atieno has fallen back on the support of her friends and relatives.\r\n\"I want to carry on living but I am ill and I have no money,\" Atieno\r\nadds.\r\nShe, like many women in Dandora, Kayole, Kibera and many other\r\nlow-income urban areas, do no know how to discuss Aids when it hits\r\nthe family. Many. would rather not discuss it, let alone go public about\r\ntheir status. Yet, going public can make the difference between living\r\nanother five years and dying after a few months.\r\n\"Patients die faster because of secrecy,\" says Dr Mohammed Abdallah,\r\nthe chairman of the National Aids Control Council. \"Their stress,\r\nflu and other opportunistic infections go untreated because they are\r\nafraid to go public. Kenya may not need retro-viral drugs if people\r\nsuffering from Aids are open about it,\" he adds.\r\nAtieno has recorded all her experiences in a notebook. It is her way\r\nof coming to terms with her reality. She says she is glad her relatives did\r\nnot shun her when she told them about her HIV status, but adds that\r\nher friends took it differently.\r\nHer husband has never been comfortable with her publicising her\r\nHlV status. She claims that he has taken her Aids test\r\nresult and other important papers so that she has no\r\nproof of her status.\r\nWhen she tells friends that she is HIV positive, they\r\nfirst go to talk among themselves, then return to ask:\r\n\"If you are HIV positive, how can you admit it?\"\r\n\"When I show them my test results, they just break\r\ndown and cry,\" she says.\r\nMarriages were never meant to be what Atieno\r\nclaims hers turned out to be - a highway to the\r\ngrave, a death trap.\r\nSo she is angry, and in the heat of her anger, she\r\nvoices homicidal thoughts.\r\nOnce, her husband reported her to the Buru Buru\r\npolice station, alleging that she had threatened to kill\r\n.him. She was summoned to the station, and went with\r\na case of her own - she wanted to report that she\r\nhad been infected with HIV.\r\nThat is a case the police do not know how to deal\r\nwith (see separate story below). Without proof, says police spokesman\r\nPeter Kimanthi, it would be difficult to press charges. If it was assault,\r\nthey could understand that, but not infe,ction with Aids.\r\nYet, Elizabeth is a bewildered woman. She cannot understand why\r\nthe President's suggestion, that people who intentionally infect others\r\nwith HIV be hanged, has not been effected.\r\nEven at the Kenya Network of Women with Aids, campaigner\r\nAsunta Wagura says the legal issues surrounding HIV and Aids are\r\nlargely still unresolved. She hopes they can refer Atieno's case to the\r\nFederation of Women Lawyers in Kenya (Fida), where the alleged\r\nharassment and assault case can be pursued from.\r\nWhatever recourse is found for Atieno, it is unlikely to take away\r\nhers bitterness. It springs from the things she says her husband told her:\r\n\"Have you heard that anyone has bee.n arrested for infecting another\r\nperson with HlV?\"\r\nAgain, she breaks into tears, and as you hold her hand, trying to\r\nreassure her that this is not the end of the world, to explain that the\r\nPresident only made a suggestion that will take years to become law, it\r\noccurs to you that she is inconsolable. You can only calm her down and\r\nhear her through. There is no bairn sufficient to soothe her pain, no\r\nwords soothing enough to ease her misery. Her spirit is unsettled, and it\r\nwanders, refusing to be consoled.\r\nIt is her life, and she sees it - in her mind's eye - coming to an\r\nabrupt and sudden end before she has accomplished any of the things\r\nshe dreamt of doing. She thinks of her father, and when she speaks\r\nabout him, another flood of tears washes her cheeks.\r\nOne may be counselled to accept their status, but Atieno says: \"He\r\nwill not give me my life back. My daughter will be left all alone.\r\n\"Even if I am compensated in millions, it will not soothe my heart. It\r\nwill not give me back my life. It will not help me.\"\r\n\"Should moneyed people do as they wish? Don't the poor have any\r\nrights?\" ,\r\nIt is a question whose answer is still blowing in the wind."}
