MEDICAL OFFICIAL CLARIFIES HIV DATA

By JOHN OYWA
Nyanza medical authorities have
denied reports that 80 per cent
of blood doitated by school chil
dren in the province had
Huy.
Provincial medical officer
Anibrose Misore told a seminar
in Kisuniu yesterday that press
reports attributed to Provincial
Commissioner Peter Raburu
were misleading.
Saying he was in fact the one
who made the remarks, Dr Mis-
ore clarified: “Only between 2.5
and eight per cent of blood
donated by school children in
thc province has bccn Ibund
with H IV.”
I-le accused the Press of mis
representation, saying: “We
were misquoted. Somebody
maliciotisly added a zero to fig
ure eight to niake it eighty.”
Provincial Director of Educa
tion Roselyn Onyuka had ques
tioned the figures and demanded
to know their source.
She said inaccurate data on
WV/Aids were causing concern,
adding that parents had bom
barded her with telephone calls
seeking clarification.
“I need to be furnished with a
report on how the 80 per cciii
was arrived at. I am calling for
investigations into the matter.”
Participants said conflicting
Aids research findings threat
ened to frustrate the campaign
against the disease.
Many non governmental
organisations and community.
based organisations in the prov
mcc were neither collaborating
nor sharing information on the
disease, leading to cotlicting
infection statistics,
“We have too many Hl V/Aids
siakeholders in the province
They are suspicious of each other
and do not share information,”
said Mr Lawrence Okudo, the
Provincial Aids Control Commit
tee coordinator.
The seminar, bringing together
all HIV/Aids stakeholders in the
province, was funded by Action-
Aid, the Futures Group and
Unicef.
It was called to assess the coin
petcnce of participants in the
campaign against the disease,
Dr Misore said the Ill V/Aids
infection rate in Nyanza was sta
bilising. but called for a more
aggressive campaign to ensure
behaviour change and care for the
victims.
In a speech read on his behalf
by Assistant Minister Abdullahi
Wako, Public Health Minister
Sam Ongeri called for a coordi
nated effort to fight the disease.
At the Kenya Medical Associa
tion’s 29th Annual Medical and
Scientific Conference in K.isumu
recently, some doctors and health
institutions were accused of with
holding information on the 111V!
Aids status of patients.
The participants argued that
this contributed to the spread of
the disease.
