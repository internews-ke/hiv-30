MINISTER REASURES OVER AIDS MEDICINE

Aids drugs will cost the government
Sh 12 billion annually if the
laws on importation are not
changed, Public Health Minister
Sam Ongeri has said.
The minister said a Bill pending
in Parliament to review the
laws will be discussed and passed
so that patients can access antire~
roviral drugs at affordable
pnces.
Prof Ongeri advised Aids
patients not to despair because of
the high costs of drugs because
they would soon be aftordable
when the Bill becomes law.
'There is hope that the Bill on
Aids drugs will automatically sail
through to enable the government
import cheap drugs," said Prof
Ongeri.
The minister was speaking at
the Flourspar Mining Company
Hall, Keiyo District, on Friday
during the launch of an awareness
campaign and free treatment
organised by medicine students
of Moi University.
The minister was accompanied

Officer of Health Gideon
Toromo.
Prof Ongeri said 50 per cent of in-patients in the government hospitals were IIIV-positive.
Mr Biwott told his constituents
to abstain from irresponsible sex
to check the spread of the
scourge.
Meanwhile, anti-retroviral
drugs cannot cure HIV/Aids, Cabinet
Minister Marsden Madoka
said yesterday.
Mr Madoka said the drugs can
only control the virus, cautioning
that pharmaceutical firnls were
cheating patients that the drugs
could cure.
"Some international pharmaceutical
companies should stop
cheating that these drugs, still
being experimented, can cure
Aids," he said.
The minister was speaking at
the Busia Municipal Stadium
when he launched the Nambale
Constituency Aids committee.
He said 16 per cent of adults in
Western Province have tested
HIV positive.
Mr Madoka was accompanied
by Finance Minister Chris Okemo
and Attorney-General Amos
Wako.
Mr Wako said the government
wiII set up a task force to address
legal issues conceming HIV/Aids.
He said the task torce will
advise on urgent measures to deal
with the Aids pandemic.
Mr Okemo attributed the high
incidence of Aids to archaic cultural
beliefs among the Luhya.
