Its desirability lies in\r\n~ sImple fact. Any mdependent and thorough inquiry might\r\nfind everybody - from the filing clerk to the permanent\r\nsecretary - guilty.\r\n    To be sure, the amount involved is stupendous.

Of course.\r\n    Bu~ if you started probing and then prosecuting all the\r\nc~lpnts, wher~ would you end? It would be a truly anarchic\r\nwltch-.hunt. It ISnot merely that they are too many.
