However, while there IS eVldcnce to sUJ:)ort their behef, promotmg CIrcumCIsion\r\nas a way to prevent the spread of I flV may not be appropriate.\r\n\"If health officials recommend circumcision to reduce HIV risks, some\r\nmen might incorrectly assume that cir\"umcision offers excellent protection\r\nagainst HIV.\r\n\"As as result, many of them may adopt risky ~exual behavio.ur, s~ch as not using\r\ncondoms, having multiple sexual partners, or ha, m&sex With hlgh-nsk partners. The\r\noverall effect could increase the spread of HIV,\" (he Journal reports.\r\nAlso, circumcision by unqualified individuals under unsanitary conditions can lead+\r\nto serious long-term complications or even deat[.\r\n\u201cMen who elect to undergo the surgical procedure\r\nshould have qualified medical personnel pertorm it\r\nunder hygienic conditions,\u201d it reports.\r\n\u201cOur current position is that the evidence for a pro.\r\ntective effect of male circumcision on 111V acquisition\r\nin high-risk settings is reasonably convincing,\u201d the\r\njournal quotes Dr Timothy Farley of the World lealth\r\nOranisation\u2019s Prvtramme of Research, Development\r\nand Research Training in Human Reproduction in\r\nGeneva.\r\nBut, Dr Fancy says. \u201cthere is no evidence that pro\r\nmoling circumcision among boys or men actually\r\nreduces the incidence of HIV infection, and there is a\r\ngenuine possibility that it may undermine other 111V-\r\npreventive strategieS.\r\nAnd Dr Michel Carael, HIV prevention team leader\r\nin Geneva with the Joint United Nations Programme\r\non IIIV/Aids, says: \u201cWhile there is a need for the\r\ninternational research community to be actively\r\ninvo1ved in further investigating the association\r\nbetween circumcision and HIV prevention, it is too\r\nearly to make clear recommendations about this\r\nmatter.\u201d\r\nMen in some African countries seem to be seeking\r\ncircutucision to reduce 111V risks. Dr Ernest Ekong, a\r\npublic health physician at Military Base Hospital in\r\nYaba Lago. Nigeria, says there is an increased demand\r\nfor male circumcision in his country now as an \u00a1LIV-\r\nprevention strategy.\r\nIn South Africa, many men are going to local clinics\r\nor general practitioners to be circumcised for health\r\nreasons, with their wives often making the appoint\r\nment for them,\r\nGlobally, about 20 per cent of men arc circumcised\r\nfor religious, cultural, medical or other reasons.\r\nThroughout the developing world, only a small per\r\ncentage of male circumcisions are performed under\r\nsterile conditions by qualified medical personnel.\r\nMorbidity rates from circumcision arc high.\r\nThe journal says some observers also point out that\r\nvariation in circumcision practices may help explain\r\nwhy HIV rates in countries or regions differ. In areas\r\nwhere circumcision is common, HIV infection rates\r\ntend to be low.\r\nJ n North America, where about 80 per cent of\r\nmen arc circumcised, only a fraction of one per\r\ncern of the population is H 1V-positive.\r\nIn western Africa. another area where circum\r\ncision is widely practised, rates of HIV infection\r\namong those ages 15 to 49 are just one per cent to\r\nfive per cent. But in eastern and southern Africa,\r\nwhere typically fewer than 20 per cent of men are\r\ncircumcised, rates of I-11V infection range from IS per\r\ncent to 25 per cent.\r\n\u2018 The spread of 111V in l\u2019hailand and Cambodia also\r\nhas been largely attributed to low male circumcision\r\nrates. ,\r\nhowever, the report says, other scientists point out\r\nthat at least five studies have found no protective role\r\nfor circumcision and one has found that circumcision\r\nincreases risk of HIV infection.\r\nThere are discrepancies. Why, for example, are .\r\n1-11V rates lower in Europe, where men typically are\r\nuncircumcised? Why are they high in some places,\r\nlike Ethiopia, where men are usually circumcised?\r\nThe journal says some of these incongruities might\r\nbe explained by behaviour. Some circumcised men,\r\nfor example, may have hygienic, cultural or religious\r\npractices that reduce their risk of HIV infection. This\r\nincluded Muslim nien, whose religion forbids alcohol\r\nuse (associated with high-risk sex with commercial\r\nsex workers and failure to use condoms).\r\nOther Muslim practices that may help reduce HIV\r\ntransmission include polygamous marnages (that limit\r\nsexual activity with women outside the family of mul\r\ntiple wives) and posicoital genital washing before\r\npraying.\r\nNetwork reports that uncircumcised m\u00e7n may be\r\nmore likely to develop cancer of the penis because\r\nthey appear to be at risk of being infected with human\r\npapilloma virus (II PV).\r\nk says in a study of 38 Argentinian men with penile\r\ncancer, most cancers were related to HPV.\r\nIn Bali, it has been estimated that over 75 per cent\r\nof genital cancers contain HPV. As of 1986, cervical\r\ncancer, which is often associated with HPV infection,\r\nwas the most frequent cancer in Balinese women.\r\nPenile cancer was the second most frequent cancer\r\nin Balinese men, who are rarely circumcised."}
