   'Living fossil'
   fish captured
   off Malindi
  By Gordon Boy
  A rare fish believed to have been extinct for over
  65 million years and now considered a "living fos-
  sil" has been captured off Malindi. It is the first
  ever recording of the fish species in East African
  waters.
     Until 1938, when a living coelacanth was dis-
  covered off the eastern coast of South Africa, at
  the mouth of the Chalumna River near East Lon-
  don, coelacanths were known only from ancient
  fossils - some dating back more than 360 million
  years. Their sudden disappearance from the fossil
  record about 80 million years ago suggested that
  coelacanths had become extinct at the same time
  as the dinosaurs.
      Kenya's very own coelacanth, properly
  mounted and displayed, could become a major
  attraction for tourists and the public. For coe1a-
  canths are so very seldom captured that only a
  few museums around the world can boast of hav-
  ing one.
      Like many great discoveries, the fish was cap-
   tured accidentally by the crew of mv Venture II
   at a depth of 85 metres. They did not even know
   what they had stumbled on.
      The fish was kept frozen for nearly four
   months, and in virtual obscurity, in the cold stor-
   age depot of Wananchi Marine Products, for
   whom the trawler had been working when the                                                                                                                                                                                    Photo/National Museums of Kenya
