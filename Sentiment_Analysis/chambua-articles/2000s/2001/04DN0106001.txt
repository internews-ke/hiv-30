Gitari warns against falling prey to sects

By ANTHONY KARIGA
Christians were yesterday warned
against blindly following splinter
religious groups.
The head of the Anglican
Church, Archbishop David Gitan,
said the sects placing big adver
tisements in the print and elec
tronic media were commercially
motivated.
He said the publicity-hungry
sects were exploiting unsuspect
ing worshippers in their mistaken
belief that all their problems
could be soIved
He said the groups, mostly
imposed on Kenyans from for
eign countries, were suspicious in
their approach to the Christian
doctrine, and he warned Kenyans
against following them blindly.
Speaking at the Kiriithiru
Anglican Church, Murang’a Dis
trict, he said most of the new
sects claimed to possess miracu
lous power to heal and solve eco
nomic hardships.
Dr Gitan asked: “If they can
really cure diseases, why can’t
they emulate Jesus when he
healed the leper and told him to
go and not to tell anyone?”
On the Aids scourge, he
reminded the youth to abstain
from preniaiilal sex and undergo
an HIV test before they enter into
marriage.
Marriage partners ought to
know their HIV status to make
wise choices, he said, although
this was not official church
policy.
He said the Anglican style of
worship was being reviewed to
reduce defection by the youth.
