NOW go on and get
Osallla bin Laden
Shortly after 9 am on August 7, 1998, two simultaneous
bomb blasts ripped apart American embassies in Nairobi
and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, killing at least 224 people.
More than 200 KeJ.1yans died in the explosion for reasons
never understood to this day, while thousands others were
maimed, some for life.
   On Tuesday, almost three years later, after months of
trial and 10 days of deliberations by a jury, four suspects of
the twin bombings were found guilty, two of them of
murder and the other two of conspiracy to kill Americans.
   For us here, especially the hundreds who lost their rela-
tives and friends, it can never be enough that some four
fellows known as Mohamed Rashid Daoud al-Owhali,
Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, Wadih el Hage and Mohamed
Saddiq Odeh, most in their 20s, may face the death penalty
or a lifetime in jail.
   The trauma goes much deeper than that and only the
apprehension, trial and conviction of the mastermind of the
terrible carnage, said to be Osama bin Laden, who is holed
up in Afghanistan, can begin to salve the painful wound.
   There is also the knowledge that besides the four, and
besides the monstrous Bin Laden, there are at least nine            SPECIAL REPORT
more suspects at large, who may at this very moment be
plotting to kill hundreds more all over the world in their
mad pursuit of American targets. Any celebrations by the
victims of the Nairobi bomb attack that the perpetrators            Research work on HIV
may, at last, get their just deserts, will always be tempered
 by the sneaking feeling that danger lurks in every comer,
 especially where foreign interests are not even paramount.
    How many innocent people in the world are going to die
 because of terrorist attacks on American targets?                  jabs in grave jeopardy
    Terrorism was becoming anachronistic until Bin Laden
 came along. There was a time it was the weapon of choice
 for those without alternatives, but even then, terrorists have
