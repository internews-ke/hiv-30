BY NATION CORRESPONDENT

Police officers have been advised to
rnaintain high moral standards as a way
of fighting the Aids scourge.
Police Commissioner Philemon
;\bong'o told the officers to abstain
from sex or be faithful to their partners
to avoid being infected with HIV.
"Let us observe high morals as a
means to combat the spread of the disease,"
Mr Abong'o said in a statement
read by Mr Japheth Mwania during the
inter-provincial drill competition at the
Kenya Police Training College, Kiganjo.
The traffic department took first posi-
,tion in the 11-team competition and was
,followed by the Airport Police Unit and
, the Coast Province police.
Meanwhile, Kenyans have been urged
i to perceive police officers as friends and
, not enemies.
Assistant Commissioner of Police, Mr
Philip Ndwiga, said police are demoral- '
ised by the public's negative attitude
towards them.
He said this shortly after presiding
over a ground breaking ceremony of a
chapel at Buru Buru police station,
Nairobi.
