My experi\r\nence is thai each time the Opposi\r\ntion plans a Bill that enjoys wide\r\npublic support, the Government\r\nwill crowd the timetable with\r\nother things. It is likely to happen\r\nagain\u201d.\r\nSaid Mr Nderitu: \u201cThe Gov\r\nernment is dragging its feet\r\nbecause a lot of its officials have\r\nvested interests in everything,\r\nincluding the pharmaceuticals.\r\nSome of them are the importers of\r\nthe expensive drugs.\r\n\u201cIt is third parties making the\r\ndrugs that expensive. Sorne polii.i\r\nC \u00a1ans or people connected with\r\nthem want a cut. (n the end, they\r\narc cutting the flesh of the dead.\r\nThey want this scourge to last as\r\nlong as possible so they can make\r\na killing.\u201d The MP added: \u201cThe\r\nguys making money out of this\r\nscourge are the same ones making\r\nlaws in Parliament\u201d.\r\n\r\n\r\nKNECS TOUGH LINE ON EXAM CHEATING\r\n\r\nBy DENNIS ONYANGO\r\nThe Kenya National Examina\r\ntions Council will continue to\r\nwithhold or cancel results of\r\nschools and candidates suspected\r\nto have cheated in national\r\nexaminations.\r\nThe Council Secretary, Mr\r\nJuma Mwachihi, said the exams\r\nbody would also remove the cul\r\nprits from the roll of approved\r\nexamination centres and even bar\r\nthem from entry to future exami\r\nnations depending on the degree\r\nof misconduct.\r\nIn a speech at the Precious\r\nIllood Girls\u2019 Secondary School,\r\nRiruta, Nairobi, during the Par\r\nents\u2019 Day, Mr Mwachihi said the\r\ncouncil would use its discretion\r\nto disqualify candidates at a cen\r\ntre that does not follow\r\nregulations.\r\n\u201ccheating in examinations\r\ncan, ii undetected and unpun\r\nished, threaten the very core of an\r\nexaminations body. If candidates\r\nwho cheat get certificates, they\r\nundermine one of the main func\r\ntions of examinations, which is to\r\ngrade candidates according to\r\ntheir abilities.\u201d\r\nThe Kenya National Examina\r\ntions Act, he said, gives the coun\r\ncil powers to take drastic meas\r\nures to safeguard the reputation\r\nof national exams.\r\nCheating \u201ccan undermine the\r\nvalues of an honest candidate if it\r\nappeared that dishonest candi\r\ndates were the ones who were\r\nbeing allocated places on the\r\nbasis of grades attained through\r\ncheating,\u201d\r\nThe KNEC boss attributed the\r\nincreased cases of cheating to\r\nstiff competition for places and\r\njobs, poor preparation by candi\r\ndates and poor supervision during\r\nexaminations. He also blamed\r\nheadteachers and their staff, say\r\ning they play a role in cheating.\r\n\u201cWe would all like to have\r\nirregularity-free examinations\r\nand I have every reason to\r\nbelieve this is possible.\u201d\r\nThe council does not enjoy\r\ncancelling results, he said. It is\r\n\u2018very painful\u201d for one to spend\r\ntime and resources in school for\r\nfour years only to cheat in exams\r\nand lose results.\r\nEarly this year, more than\r\n2,000 candidates had their results\r\ncancelled, sparking protests from\r\nMembers of Parliameju and the\r\npublic.\r\nThe Government appointed a\r\ncommittee to look into the cir\r\ncumstances that led to the\r\ncancellations.\r\nThis week, Mr Mwachihi said\r\nthe council and the Ministry of\r\nEducation would ensure \u201call those\r\nwho abet this evil activity are\r\npunished because the policy is to\r\nstamp out examination irregulari\r\nties at all costs.\u201d\r\nThe secretary, who was the\r\nchief guest, said the Ministry of\r\nEducation has formulated guide\r\nlines to allow girls who drop Out\r\nof school because of pregnancy to\r\nresume learning after they deliver.\r\nDespite the ministry\u2019s policy,\r\nthe secretary said the fool-proof\r\noption for girls is to \u201csay No to\r\npremarital sex.\u201d\r\nHe said Aids was ravaging\r\nschools and disclosed that blood\r\ntests conducted in one girls\u2019\r\nschool found 60 per cent of them\r\nHIV.positive.\r\nHe urged Precious Blood\r\nSchool to expand and admit more\r\nstudents.\r\nHe suggested that the school\r\nrelocate to a new site to allow for\r\nexpansion. . :\r\nHe praised the school\u2019s per\r\nformance in national examina\r\ntions. Last year, more than 50 per\r\nCent of the candidates attained\r\ngrade A minus or better in\r\nMathematics.\r\n\u201cIt is a clear proof that this\r\nsubject is not insurmCuntable as\r\nmany schools have cotne to erro\r\nneously believe,\u201d he said."}
