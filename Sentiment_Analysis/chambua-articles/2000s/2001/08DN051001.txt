Nairobi at a crossroads
           oW can the authorities sit without the slightest bit of
H         concern as the capital's commuter transport system
          slides into anarchy?
             Nairobi, right now, must be one of the few
emerging metropolitan areas without a formal and regulated
urban transport system.
   What is scandalous is not that Nairobi has never had one,
but that what existed has been allowed to fall apart and that
nobody seems to be giving the slightest thought to the
problem.
   The Kenya Bus Services (KBS) lost its franchise years ago.
But, by then, the pirate taxi system known as matatu had
already been allowed to invade its routes.
   Now the only formal commuter service provider has
thrown in the towel and decided to copy the unregulated and
crude ways of the matatu operators. It is giving up the
business altogether and leasing out its remaining buses to
wildcat operators.
   The m:w operators, in turn, are competing with all manner
of buses that have somehow been allowed to operate in the
city usin,g facilities originally installed and maintained by the
KBS.
   The degeneration of service is apparent. Buses manned by
people with little respect for safe driving, courtesy and good                                                      TRADING PLACES                 a KWAMCHETSI                    MAKOKHA                                                ,

operators demand the right to operate in parts of the city
centre to which they have previously been denied access.
After all, all manner of buses are competing for passengers in
exactly the same way matatus do.                                                                                                                                                              The,Kenyatta family is a house divided.
