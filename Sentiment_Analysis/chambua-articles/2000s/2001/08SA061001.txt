Capitalise on Blair's lifeline
W         hat Mr Tony Blair said about Africa at the annual
           refreshing indeed.  He proposed a "partnership" in .
           Labour Party conference on Wednesday was
which the West would provide more aid, write off debt, help
develop infrastructures, encourage more foreign investment
and open its markets to more African produce.
   Africa would, in turn, promote greater democracy and good
governance, uphold human rights, reduce corruption and
resource mismanagement and begin on the road of setting up
modern commercial, legal and financial systems.
   Nothing is new as such. Yet the British Prime Minister's is
likely to be the first since decolonisation half a century ago
that a major Western political movement has devoted
substantial time at an annual convention to the continent.
   It was an acknowledgment that, despite its troubles, Africa
cannot be ignored and that the West, since much of Africa's
present woes have European colonial roots, must playa
greater role than hitherto in helping cultivate a more equal
relationship.
   It was also a recognition that an Africa plagued with
pove:rty, disease; hunger and instability is a threat sooner or
later to global stability. One phrase in Mr Blair's speech
perf1ectly illustrates the new thinking: Promote Africa's
"access to our markets so we can trade as freely as we are so
fond of preaching".                                          '

   Unprofitable state enterprises have been sold off or closed
down. Agricultural and industrial subsidies have been
elinlinated. The markets have been opened up to mas!!
imports that have crippled local industry.                                                                           early      20 years ago, when                                                        service, the alarm has gone off. Urgent
