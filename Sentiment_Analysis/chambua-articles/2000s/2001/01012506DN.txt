{"text": " 6\r\n DAIL Y\r\n NATION\r\n      Nairobi, Thursday, January 25, 2001\r\n Allow DRC to sort\r\n out its own destiny\r\n The African Francophone bloc's summit in Yaounde was tQe latest\r\n edition of a most interesting gathering - the Gallic equivalent of\r\n,the Commonwealth.\r\n     Until quite recently, an old man whom many English-speaking\r\n Africans have never heard of exercised great power and influence\r\n over Francophone Africa and such proceedings as has just ended in\r\n Cameroon. His name was Jacques Foccart, the power-broker and\r\n discreet adviser to all post-World War II French presidents, whose\r\n speciality was Francophone Africa.\r\n     Upon Monsieur Foccart's death nearly four years ago, London's\r\n Economist magazine         eulogised him: \"As [former President\r\n Charles] de Gaulle's man, Mr Foccart became the African leaders'\r\n protector and kingmaker, deciding when France should intervene to\r\n prop up an ally and when it should allow a coup to remove a\r\n recalcitrant ruler. It was said that in his desk he kept signed letters\r\n  from African presidents requesting French intervention. Mr Foccart\r\n  needed only to add the date.\"\r\n     This arch-manipulator, who was the behind-the-scenes player\r\n  for half-a-century, died in March, 1997, in his 80s, and he still had\r\n an office in the Elysee Palace and acted as adviser to President\r\n Chirac. He saw Joseph Desire Mobutu come to power in ]965 and\r\n come to grief in 1997. He saw Laurent Desiree Kabila advance on\r\n Kinshasa in 1997.\r\n     Once again in the DRC, a country colonised by the Belgians but\r\n afterwards under predominantly French and American influence,\r\n the hand of foreign hegemony is apparent in Congolese affairs.               NEWS ANALYSIS\r\n     It was made explicitly clear at President Kabi]a's State funeral,\r\n for example, that Zimbabwean and Angolan troops provided not\r\n only the guard of honour, but security for the visiting dignitaries,\r\n controlled by Kinshasa.\r\n including the heads of state of these two countries, which had            Aids in Africa: A case\r\n propped up the elder Kabi]a's side of the civil war.
