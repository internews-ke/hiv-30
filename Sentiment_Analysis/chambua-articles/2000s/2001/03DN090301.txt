AIDS DRUG PRICES GO DOWN BY 15 PERCENT

By SYLVIA LYALL
The Pharmaceutical Society of
Kenya has announced a 15 per
cent discount for anti-retroviral
drugs.
This will only apply in licensed
pharmacies with Green Cross
symbols, the society’s National
Chairman, Dr Kamamia wa Muri
chu, said yesterday.
He said the society was ready
to offer all its outlets for distribu
tion of anti-retroviral drugs.
Mr Murichu appealed to pilar
maceutical companies to urgently
reduce their prices in view of the
crisis.
“The price of other drugs taken
alongside the anti-retroviral med
¡cation such as those for Tubercu
losis and other opportunistic
infections must come down to
affordable levels,” he said.
Mr Murichu said that even
though the Kenya Industrial Bill
would be tabled in Parliament
this month, where the provision
for parallel imports would allow
the government import anti
reiroviral drugs cheaply, the
society had established that
patients would not be able to
afford the medication.
At the same time, Mr Murichu
sounded (he alarm over thc possi
bility of sub-standard and sub-
potent anti-retroviral drugs being
imported and sold locally.
He said that in the event Parlia
ment passes a law allowing
imports, there was need to desig
nate the source of anti-retroviral
drugs to ensure compliance to the
World Health Organisation
standards.
Mr Munchu said the Kenya
Industrial Property Act allows for
compulsory licensing, adding:
“This is where the government
can invoke the Act and authorise
our local pharmaceutical compa
nies to manufacture and sell anti
retrovirals at affordable prices.”
Elsewhere, the International
Conference of the Federation of
Trade Unions (ICFTU) called on
all its member-states to support
the South African Government in
ils court battle against mukina
tional pharmaceutical companies.
South African is embroiled in a
court battle with 39 multination
als after it passed a law allowing
the importation of cheap generic
versions of patented HIV/Aids
drugs.
The companies have patented
the drugs for 20 years under the
Trade Related and Intellectual
Property Rights (TRiPS).
The ICFTU General Secretary,
Mr Andrew Kailembo, told a
Press conference that workers’
rights were seriously threatened
because people living with HIV/
Aids were being subjected to stig
matisation, discrimination and
hostility in the community and at
work.
He called on the government to
support South Africa’s vision,
saying Kenya and other African
countries stood to benefit if South
Africa won.
“Of the 34.4 million people liv
ing with HIV/Aids, 24.5 million
live in sub-Saharan Africa. It is
estimated that 2.2 million Ken
yans and 4.2 million South Aft-i.
cans are HIV positive,” he said.
