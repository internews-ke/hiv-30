crisis in many parts of this country. The workforce is steadily
being depleted by illnesses arising from HIV infection. And
the burden on the health service is bound to reverse virtually
every gain made in the past few years.

us and what needs to be done, not when death stalks the land
with such impunity.
   The truth is that there are too many people still engaged in
high-risk behaviour and too many being infected because
