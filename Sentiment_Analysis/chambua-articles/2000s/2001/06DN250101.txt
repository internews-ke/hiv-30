 Allow DRC to sort
 out its own destiny
 The African Francophone bloc's summit in Yaounde was tQe latest
 edition of a most interesting gathering - the Gallic equivalent of
,the Commonwealth.
     Until quite recently, an old man whom many English-speaking
 Africans have never heard of exercised great power and influence
 over Francophone Africa and such proceedings as has just ended in
 Cameroon. His name was Jacques Foccart, the power-broker and
 discreet adviser to all post-World War II French presidents, whose
 speciality was Francophone Africa.
     Upon Monsieur Foccart's death nearly four years ago, London's
 Economist magazine         eulogised him: "As [former President
 Charles] de Gaulle's man, Mr Foccart became the African leaders'
 protector and kingmaker, deciding when France should intervene to
 prop up an ally and when it should allow a coup to remove a
 recalcitrant ruler. It was said that in his desk he kept signed letters
  from African presidents requesting French intervention. Mr Foccart
  needed only to add the date."
     This arch-manipulator, who was the behind-the-scenes player
  for half-a-century, died in March, 1997, in his 80s, and he still had
 an office in the Elysee Palace and acted as adviser to President
 Chirac. He saw Joseph Desire Mobutu come to power in ]965 and
 come to grief in 1997. He saw Laurent Desiree Kabila advance on
 Kinshasa in 1997.
     Once again in the DRC, a country colonised by the Belgians but
 afterwards under predominantly French and American influence,
 the hand of foreign hegemony is apparent in Congolese affairs.               NEWS ANALYSIS

     Not all foreign manipulators of Congo (or other Francophone
