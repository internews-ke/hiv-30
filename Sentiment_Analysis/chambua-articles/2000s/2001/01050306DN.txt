That the debate, in Parliament, degener-\r\nated into insults, highly scurrilous personal attacks and even\r\nethnic sabre-rattling,  is highly regrettable.\r\n   But that, probably, is what might best illustrate the extent\r\nof mistrust, suspicion and fear afflicting the national body\r\npolitic. The strange effect is that those who stand to benefit\r\nmost from a process which might ultimately result in for-\r\ngiveness and reconciliation,     are the ones taking a reflexive\r\nstand against any such proposal.\r\n   Amnesty, as envisaged, presupposes        that a crime has been\r\ncommitted and that the perpetrator is willing to confess and\r\nplead for forgiveness.\r\n   Those in power now are not about to surrender their                      NEWS ANALYSIS\r\ndignity in such a fashion. They may also have reason to be\r\nwary that those pushing for a truth commission             may not be\r\nand mutual trust, there will be little progress in efforts at\r\nas sincere as they sound. It is easy, after all, for such a\r\ndevice to be transformed into an inquisition.

What some opposition\r\npoliticians are putting across is that they cannot wait for                 sea over Aids scourge\r\nPresident Moi's tenure to end to seek retribution.
