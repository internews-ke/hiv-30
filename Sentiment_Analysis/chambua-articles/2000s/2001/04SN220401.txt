The long-awaited Maendeleo
ya Wanawake elections have
been put off indefinitely.
The chairperson, Mrs Zip
porab Kittony, said the organ
isation would not hold the
elections until the review of
its present constitution is
completed.
Mrs Kittony, a Nominated
MP, spoke yesterday during
the close of a two-day HIVI
Aids symposium organised
by MYWO at the Moi inter
national Sports Centre,
Kasarani, Nairobi ,
She said: “Recognising
that the MYWO’s constitu
tion is being reviewed, it is
proposed that the elections
will not be held until such a
time that the process is
finaliscd.”
The five-year mandate of
the current office is supposed
to end early this year. Mrs
Kittony took office in March
1996 in a controversial elec
tion, replacing Mrs riIkia
Onsando. ,
Yesterday, Mrs Kittony
promised members that once
the review of the organisa
tion’s document ¡s finalised,
the constitution will be made
available to members at the
grassroots level and other
members.
The organisation was also
in the process of appointing
an executive director to
replace Mrs Benedette
Musundi who was recently
appointed PS for Home
Affairs.
On the HiV/Aids pandemic, the MYWO boss said her
organisation was working
with the government to take
measures to combat the
disease.
The measures, she said,
include advocacy, effective
communication and home-
based care that targeted
women and the youth. The
two groups, Mrs Kittony
said, constituted the most
vulnerable lot.
Members of the organisa
tion were urged to get
involved in projects aimed at
poverty eradication, particu
larly in drought-ravaged
areas.
The organisation’s secre
tary, Mereso Agina,
announced that MYWO had
formed a committee to
organise celebrations for its
Silver Jubilee.


Medical body to lodge
plea over Aids drugs

By SUNDAY NATON Reporter

The Kenya Medical Association
wants the government to invoke
disaster laws and enable it import
cheap generic Aids drugs
immediately.
The assocaiton’s chairman, Dr
James Nyikal, yesterday said that
since Kenya had already
declared Aids a national disaster,
the move would be the only
alternative before Parliament
amends the intellectual property
rights Bill.
“We should ensure that this is
done as quickly as possible so
that we can save and prolong the
lives of those who are already
infected with the killer virus.
“Since thc Bill — rhjch is yet
to be tabled — may take several
months before it is debated and
enacted, this remains the only via
ble option,” the association boss
observed while addressing the
Nation in Nairobi.
The sentiments by the assoc
tian come in the wake of Thurs
day’s landmark decision by phar
maceutical companies to drop a
fight to keep cheap anti-Aids
drugš out of South Africa.
At the same time, Fr Angelo
d’Agostino of Nyunibani Chil
dren’s Home for Aids Orphans
appealed to the Health Ministry’s
Pharmacy and Poisons Board to
speed up issuance of “letters of no
objection” to enable him import
the drugs from Brazil.
