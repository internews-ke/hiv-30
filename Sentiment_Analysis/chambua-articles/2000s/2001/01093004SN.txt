We\r\ncannot go on a crusade or jihad for the\r\ngreatness of our poverty.\"\r\nCiting the historical events, Dr Njoya\r\nsaid Africans involved in various world\r\nwars were always abandoned by the\r\nEuropeans as soon as victory was\r\nachieved.\r\n\"British colonialists branded\r\nfreedom fighter Dedan Kimathi a\r\nterrorist and assassinated him.\r\nSimilarly, Jomo Kenyatta and Nelson\r\nMandela were named terrorists and\r\nimprisoned.\"\r\nThe cleric said Kenya was not a\r\ndirect target by terrorists but a victim\r\nof war between fundamentalists. He\r\nsaid the looming war would divert the\r\ncountry from the struggle for\r\ndemocracy, the fight against Aids and\r\npoverty, \"which pose a more serious\r\nthreat to Africa than global terrorism\".\r\nThe show was attended by Muslim\r\nleaders, including Supreme Council of\r\nKenya Muslims secretary-general\r\nSheik Ahmad Khalif Muhammad and\r\na number of American citizens in\r\nKenya.\r\nOne participant said the Arabs and\r\nEuropeans had proved insensitive to\r\nAfrica's needs, \"even after subjecting\r\nthe continent to great acts of terrorism\r\nthrough slave trade and colonialism\".\r\nDr Mwagiru said Kenya could offer\r\nlegal and diplomatic support in the war\r\nbut opposed any military involvement.\r\n\"We lack the resources and capacity to\r\nengage in military intervention,\" he\r\nadded. \"Involvement in this war\r\nshould be guided by our own national\r\ninterests and not what is defined by the\r\nUS or any other nation.\"\r\nMs Wanyeki urged Parliament to\r\ninitiate public debate on the issue and\r\nto develop a collective and principled\r\nforeign policy.\r\nShe said Kenya, having suffered a\r\nterrorist attack in 1998, could assist the\r\nUS Federal Bureau of Investigations,\r\n\"but allowing America the use of our\r\nmilitary bases in a campaign against\r\nAfghanistan will not end terrorism\".\r\n\r\n\r\nHEALTH:\r\n\r\nRawlings crusade against infection\r\n\r\nBy SUNDAY NATION\r\nCorrespondent\r\nFormer Ghanaian President Jerry Rawl\r\nings backs calls by President Moi for\r\nresponsible sexual behaviour to check\r\nthe spread of HJV/Aids.\r\nMr Rawlings, who is visIting Kenya,\r\nyesterday said solutions to the HIV/\r\nAids crisis lay in the people\u2019s hands and\r\nappealed for strict observance of morals\r\nas one way of battling the soourge.\r\n\u201cQuite frankly, \u00a1 do not cisagree with\r\nPresiden: Moi.
