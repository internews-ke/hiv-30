Thursday December 26, 2005\r\nCircumcision study lands\r\nresearcher into problems\r\n\r\nCONTINUED FROM PAGE 23\r\nMonitoring experts.\r\nThe study, which began six months\r\nago, seeks to find out whether circumcised\r\nmen are less likely than otherwise\r\nto be infected with the HIV\r\nMore than 300 young males have\r\nbeen circumcised since it began. The\r\nstudy requires them to be sexually active,\r\naged between 18 and 25 and be\r\nHIV-negative. They will be monitored\r\nfor two years immediately after being\r\ncircumcised.\r\nMordhan 600 young men out of the\r\nexpected 2,000 have volunteered since\r\nthe study began. Interest has been beyond\r\nthe researchers' expectations.\r\nA number of scientists, however,\r\nclaim that people are being given incentives\r\nto take part and being made to believe\r\nthey are HIVproof\r\nonce\r\ncircumcised.\r\nAccording to Prof\r\nAchola, although volunteers\r\nget free medical\r\nattention whenever\r\nill, no incentives\r\nare given to lure them into participating.\r\nHe insists the issue of the volunteers\r\nthinking they are insulated from HIV\r\ninfe~tion has been thoroughly tackled.\r\nHe is aware, says he, that, after circumcision,\r\nsome young men may engage in\r\nunsafe sex thinking they are safe.\r\n\"Our approach is to educate them on\r\nHIV/Aids and we emphasise to them\r\nthat no authoritative evidence has been\r\nproduced to indicate circumcision reduces\r\nHIV infection,\" he stresses.\r\nThe study, funded by America's\r\nNational Institutes of Health, is said to\r\nbe the first in the world that attempts to\r\ncome up with hard data on correlations\r\nbetween HIV infections and circumcision.\r\nSouth Africa initiated its own a few\r\nweeks ago and Uganda plans to launch\r\none soon. HIV experts think that, if the\r\nstudies prove the hypothesis, then they\r\nwill provicle evidence for circumcision to\r\nbe added to a list of public interventions\r\nin preventing HIV/Aids.\r\nA few weeks ago, in an interview,\r\nProf Achola insisted that all he wants is\r\nto verify earlier studies, which just compare\r\nHIV infection rates between communities\r\ncircumcising men and those\r\nthat do not.\r\nHe says: \"We want to provide evidence\r\nbased on practical results to justify\r\nor refute what other studies involving\r\nthe comparison of\r\nuntested phenome:\r\nnon say.\"\r\nHIV experts have\r\nalso demanded that\r\nstudies be done to\r\nproduce hard data\r\nshowing a relationship\r\nbetween circumcision\r\nand HIV infection, especially in\r\nAfrica, where three quarters of the\r\nworld's victims are claimed to live. \"\r\nWhat has spurred interest in the\r\nwhole issue are indications of circumcised\r\nmales with low viral loads showing\r\nless likelihood of transmitting the virus\r\nto their female partners.\r\nHowever, the same scientists have\r\nbeen confronted with cost and ethieal\r\nissues, raising a lot of reservations about\r\nthe .whole approach to managing HIV/\r\nAids.\r\nJames Ntozi, a Makerere University\r\nlecturer, has warned of money being diverted\r\nfrom other social needs to meet\r\ncircumcision costs. Or, if the exercis,: is\r\ndonor-dependent, then the programmes\r\nmight not work.\r\nIn one its issues, The Horizons, a research\r\norgan of the Population Council,\r\nhas raised fears that, in that case,\u00b7\"men\r\nmay use their circumcision status as a reason\r\nfor not using condoms, while women\r\nmay be less inclined to insist on condom\r\n. use if their male partners are\r\ncircumcised. \"\r\n\"In this scenario,\" it adds, \"women\r\nare in increased risk of contracting the\r\nvirus and this may reduce the potential\r\nbenefits of male circumcision on HIV\r\ntransmission.\" .\r\nAnother fear is that the rate of female\r\ngenital mutilation in areas where the\r\npractice exists may shoot up if men's circumcision\r\nis linked to HIV prevention.\r\nEqually emotive arguments have\r\nraised ethical questions about the age at\r\nwhich a person needs to be circumcised\r\nfor the practice to be effective.\r\nThere are worries that older men may\r\nbe left out in the strategy, since studies\r\nelsewhere in Africa show that circumcision,\r\nas a measure against HIV infection,\r\nis more effective if done before or soon\r\nafter puberty begins.\r\nIn a 1999 research on the age of male\r\ncircumcision and HIV infection risk in rural\r\nUganda, 'Kelly Kiwanuka found that\r\nmales circumcised before puberty - between\r\n13 and 20 - had a much reduced\r\nrisk compared with their uncircumcised\r\ncounterparts.\r\n,- An A we Feature"}
