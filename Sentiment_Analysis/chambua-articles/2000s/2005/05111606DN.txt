{"text": "WEDNESDAY NOVEMBER 16, 2005\r\n\r\nI am 18 years old and four months pregnant. I\r\nwould like to go for an HIV test but I am\r\nscared. My husband-to-be tested positive and\r\nI fear that my unborn child could have the virus as\r\nwell. What can I do to prevent it from getting infected\r\nwith the virus? Worried\r\nJayne Mwoki, Meru\r\nAbout 39 million people live with HIV/Aids\r\nworldwide with 75 per cent in sub-Saharan\r\nAfrica. Most of those infected and affected\r\nrange from between 15-49 years. Women in the reproductive\r\nage make-up 50 per cent of these.\r\nThe prevalence of HIV in Kenya is seven per cent with\r\nmore than 50 per cent being women.\r\nAs devastating as HIV/Aids may be, the good news is\r\nthat majority of babies born to infected mothers are\r\nborn negative. But without proper antenatal delivery\r\nand postnatal care, the risk of infection increases. This\r\naccounts for over 95 per cent of HIV infection from\r\nmother to child.\r\nHIV infection from mother to child can occur during\r\npregnancy, delivery and during breastfeeding.\r\nLong periods of labour, prolonged breakage of fore\r\nwaters, manipulations of the baby during delivery, deliveries\r\nby traditional or unskilled birth attendants among\r\nothers also increase the risk.\r\nInfant feeding practices also increase the risk of infection.\r\nThey include prolonged breastfeeding, cracked\r\nnipples and breast infection; the presence of mouth\r\nsores in the baby and mixed-feeding.\r\nWith proper interventions, the chances of your baby\r\nbeing infected can be reduced. It is possible for one to\r\nbe infected yet look and feel good until the virus takes a\r\ntoll on their health. It is also possible for a partner to test\r\npositive yet the other is negative. These are known as\r\ndiscordant couples.\r\nTo reduce the chance of mother-to-child transmission of\r\nHIV, private and government health facilities have set\r\nup clinics that offer programmes related to this. They\r\nare known as PMTCT clinics.\r\nHere, the expectant mother is taken through sessions of\r\ncounseling before the HIV test where she is educated\r\non various issues. After the test she is counseled again\r\nand supported on whatever mode of infant feeding she\r\nopts for. She is also started on medication to prevent\r\ntransmission during pregnancy and in labour. She is\r\nalso given supplements to boost her immunity.\r\nThe baby is given medication to stop any chance of\r\nHIV transmission. Safe delivery options are also\r\naddressed.\r\nTake your partner for both of you to be counseled. This\r\nis important to help identify discordant couples and for\r\npartners to give each other support.\r\nProper follow-up and care is also important.\r\nAfter delivery, an HIV positive mother and child need to\r\nbe followed up to ensure accesses to optimal health\r\ncare and family planning services.\r\nJayne, get courage and go for the test. You have a\r\nchance to stop your baby from contracting the HIV\r\ninfection.\r\nMy daughter is three years old. For one year I\r\nhave been taking her to various health facilities\r\nfor a skin condition that does not improve with\r\nmedication. I was eventually referred to a skin specialist\r\nwho said my daughter was suffering from a condition\r\nknown as pellagra, which is due to lack of vitamins.\r\nWhat is this condition and can one avoid it?\r\nMoses, Ahero\r\nPellagra or cough skin is due to lack of a vitamin\r\nknown as niacin found in common foods\r\nand forms part of the vitamin B complex group.\r\nThis vitamin is found in liver, lean pork, fish, poultry, red\r\nmeat, enriched cereals, whole grain, vegetable and\r\npeanuts.\r\nPellagra is common where foods like corn or maize are\r\nstaple foods. They are poor sources of niacin.\r\nA deficiency of this vitamin leads to swelling and\r\ndestruction of the skin support integrity, which becomes\r\nthick hard. These affect the linings of the body even in\r\nthe mouth, tongue and digestive system. With disease\r\nprogression these linings become thin and lose their\r\nfunctions. Affection of the nerves and the brain are a\r\nlate feature. Early symptoms are vague and include\r\npoor appetite, weakness, burning sensation of the skin,\r\nnumbness and dizziness. Prolonged deficiency leads to\r\nitchy skin rash, diarrhoea and mental regression. The\r\nskin rash may be triggered by chemicals or intense\r\nsunlight. They first appear on exposed surfaces that\r\nresemble a burn.\r\nThose on the hands and feet may have a particular pattern\r\nlike a glove or soak. The lesions on the neck look\r\nlike a necklace known as casal necklace.\r\nSome skin rashes may have fluid filled swellings.\r\nHealed rash is often darker than the rest. The patient\r\nmay develop sores around the mouth, on the tongue, or\r\ndevelop vomiting or diarrhoea.\r\nThe child may be depressed, disoriented or delirious\r\nand lack sleep. Other nutritional deficiencies may be\r\npresent and other family members may be affected as\r\nwell. Diagnosis is by the appearance of the child on\r\nexamination. Trial of niacin treatment confirms the disease.\r\nTreatment involves niacin administration and the\r\nresponse is quick.\r\nOther vitamin supplements are recommended. Skin\r\nsoothing applications are helpful, as are proper diets.\r\nEating a well-balanced diet that includes meat, vegetables,\r\neggs and milk best ensures the prevention of pellagra.\r\nYour daughter will be fine. Always ensure a well-balanced\r\ndiet for you family to avoid food or vitamin related\r\ndiseases.\r\nfridahafandi@yahoo.com"}
