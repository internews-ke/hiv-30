{"text": "Daily Nation/ Friday, August 12, 2005\r\n\r\nNew seeds to boost\r\nAfrica\ufffds food output\r\n\r\nBy PETER APPS\r\nAs he scans the landscape around\r\nhim, all Sam Guemba can see are\r\nmaize crops standing stunted and\r\nwithered.\r\nBut there\ufffds an exception. A\r\nfew fields shine green and fertile\r\n\ufffd the first fruit of a process aid\r\nworkers hope will alleviate the\r\nshortages endemic in southern\r\nAfrica.\r\nAt Nhampuguane in the southern\r\nMozambican Guija district,\r\nthe World Food Programme\r\n(WFP) is working with US religious\r\nagency Samaritans\ufffd Purse\r\nto encourage subsistence farmers\r\nto switch from maize to cassava\r\nand sweet potato plants.\r\nThese are better suited to the\r\nmarginal southern African climate\r\nbecause they need less\r\nwater.\r\n\ufffdHere they have tried to irrigate\r\nthe maize field,\ufffd says Guemba,\r\na Samaritans\ufffd Purse aid\r\nworker. \ufffdIt has still died because\r\nmaize needs so much water.\ufffd\r\nLess than 100 metres away\r\nfrom the dead maize, cassava and\r\nsweet potato plants are growing\r\nwell. In Mozambique, the failure\r\nof rains early this year as the staple\r\nmaize harvest ripened has left\r\nmillions facing hunger, malnutrition\r\nand, in some cases, death.\r\nDrought has also affected a\r\nregion suffering the strains of\r\nchronic poverty and the HIV\r\npandemic.\r\nUnder a food-for-work scheme\r\nin Guija, some 200 kilometres\r\n(120 miles) north of Maputo,\r\nresidents receive food handouts\r\nin return for work on the project,\r\naimed at providing seeds and\r\ncuttings to allow them to grow\r\nthe crops.\r\n\ufffdMaize itself\r\nwas introduced\r\nfrom outside a\r\nlong time ago,\ufffd\r\nsays Guemba.\r\n\ufffdThese are not\r\nvery traditional\r\ncrops, but people\r\nhere used to eat them once. And\r\nif you look around here, the only\r\nthing that is surviving is cassava.\r\nYou can eat the tubers and the\r\nleaves make a nutritious sauce.\ufffd\r\nCuttings from one cassava\r\nplant can be used to start as\r\nmany as 14 new plants and it\r\ngrows almost twice as fast as\r\nmaize.\r\nAid workers hope that once\r\nrain starts it can quickly be\r\nplanted and used to alleviate\r\nshortages later in the year as\r\nsouthern Africa\ufffds \ufffdhungry season\ufffd\r\nbites. Around Guija, officials\r\nsay only 2 per cent of the\r\nharvest was usable when it was\r\ntaken in during April.\r\nThe WFP says 10 million people\r\nin the region face shortages.\r\nFor some in Lesotho, Zimbabwe,\r\nZambia, Malawi, Swaziland and\r\nMozambique, it is their third or\r\nfourth successive bad harvest.\r\nMost will make it through, but\r\nothers will die of hunger or from\r\ndiseases that overpower weakened\r\nsystems.\r\nFamilies will\r\nsell more property\r\n\ufffd including\r\ncattle and\r\ntools \ufffd pushi\r\nn g t h e m\r\ndeeper into\r\npoverty and reducing next year\ufffds\r\noutput, too. Hunger and drought\r\nfeed off each other, deepening\r\npoverty in a variety of ways.\r\nAids has robbed many families\r\nof their older generation and,\r\nwith them, the know-how to nurture\r\ncrops through harsh seasons.\r\nIrrigation channels left in\r\nMozambique by Portuguese settlers\r\nfell into disrepair during the\r\ntwo decades of civil war that followed.\r\n(Reuters)"}
