Next weekend’s Media Rally to raise funds for charity

By FRANKLINE OKUTOYI
With just over a week to competition,
more than 15 media houses have
entered the 6th annual media rally
scheduled for October 8 in Nairobi.
According to the organiser of the
competition, John Ngunjiri, drivers from
leading electronic and print media
houses will compete in the two-day
rally. They include teams from the
Nation Media Group, the Standard
Group, Citizen, Kameme FM, KBC and
Family TV.
Others are STV and FM Sound Asia
who will both be competing for the first
time.
The purpose of this year’s event is to
assist people living with Aids at the St
Monicah Centre along Juja Road,
Newlife Centre and the Yard Project in
Gatanga.
Ngunjiri said for anyone to be cleared
to take part in the event, he or she
should donate Anti-retroviral drugs to
the organisation to help the Aids
patients. “We are planning to shift the
date of this event from October to April
next year,” Ngunjiri said. “Plans are
also at an advanced stage to include
international media rally drivers in next
year’s competition.”
Ngunjiri said the competition also
seeks to promote Kenyan tourism. He
says the change of dates to April would
be deliberate to coincide with the Easter
holidays.
Besides the journalists, company executives
and VIPs will also compete in a
special category. Also expected are
former Boston Marathon champion
Moses Tanui, Cabinet Ministers Peter
Kenneth and Raphael Tuju and Nakuru
councillor Muthoni Kihara.
“I would like to appeal to the public
to join hands with us by donating antiretroviral
drugs towards to this project
to save the lives of many Kenyans who
are living with the HIV virus,” Ngunjiri
said.
