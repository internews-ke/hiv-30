Another
Aids drug
on the way

UK, it was reported that five to six per
cent had exhausted all available treatment
options. Now there are fears that
the number is much higher.
Details of the new class of drugs indicate
that they will offer a much less
frequent dose — once a week or once
in a day for very severe cases. “When
approvals are given, we plan to move
fast and explore the possibility of
importing the drugs to Africa, though
we suspect serious cost implications,”
said Dr Joseph.
Disable the virus
The two completely new ARV classes
in development are integrase inhibitors
and maturation inhibitors. Integrase
inhibitors target and disable the virus’
enzyme, which plays a key role in replication,
while maturation inhibitors
interfere with the final stages of HIV
replication.
These drugs would prevent the virus
from assembling properly, from forming
a protective outer coat, or from
emerging — also known as budding —
from human cells.
The world depends on what is called
Highly Active Anti Retroviral Therapy,
or HAART, which is a combination of
three or more antiretroviral drugs. But
some patients have developed resistance
to all three existing classes of
drugs.
