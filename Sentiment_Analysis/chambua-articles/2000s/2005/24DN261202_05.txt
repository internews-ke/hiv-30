Circumcision study lands
researcher into problems

Monitoring experts.
The study, which began six months
ago, seeks to find out whether circumcised
men are less likely than otherwise
to be infected with the HIV
More than 300 young males have
been circumcised since it began. The
study requires them to be sexually active,
aged between 18 and 25 and be
HIV-negative. They will be monitored
for two years immediately after being
circumcised.
Mordhan 600 young men out of the
expected 2,000 have volunteered since
the study began. Interest has been beyond
the researchers' expectations.
A number of scientists, however,
claim that people are being given incentives
to take part and being made to believe
they are HIVproof
once
circumcised.
According to Prof
Achola, although volunteers
get free medical
attention whenever
ill, no incentives
are given to lure them into participating.
He insists the issue of the volunteers
thinking they are insulated from HIV
infe~tion has been thoroughly tackled.
He is aware, says he, that, after circumcision,
some young men may engage in
unsafe sex thinking they are safe.
"Our approach is to educate them on
HIV/Aids and we emphasise to them
that no authoritative evidence has been
produced to indicate circumcision reduces
HIV infection," he stresses.
The study, funded by America's
National Institutes of Health, is said to
be the first in the world that attempts to
come up with hard data on correlations
between HIV infections and circumcision.
South Africa initiated its own a few
weeks ago and Uganda plans to launch
one soon. HIV experts think that, if the
studies prove the hypothesis, then they
will provicle evidence for circumcision to
be added to a list of public interventions
in preventing HIV/Aids.
A few weeks ago, in an interview,
Prof Achola insisted that all he wants is
to verify earlier studies, which just compare
HIV infection rates between communities
circumcising men and those
that do not.
He says: "We want to provide evidence
based on practical results to justify
or refute what other studies involving
the comparison of
untested phenome:
non say."
HIV experts have
also demanded that
studies be done to
produce hard data
showing a relationship
between circumcision
and HIV infection, especially in
Africa, where three quarters of the
world's victims are claimed to live. "
What has spurred interest in the
whole issue are indications of circumcised
males with low viral loads showing
less likelihood of transmitting the virus
to their female partners.
However, the same scientists have
been confronted with cost and ethieal
issues, raising a lot of reservations about
the .whole approach to managing HIV/
Aids.
James Ntozi, a Makerere University
lecturer, has warned of money being diverted
from other social needs to meet
circumcision costs. Or, if the exercis,: is
donor-dependent, then the programmes
might not work.
In one its issues, The Horizons, a research
organ of the Population Council,
has raised fears that, in that case,·"men
may use their circumcision status as a reason
for not using condoms, while women
may be less inclined to insist on condom
. use if their male partners are
circumcised. "
"In this scenario," it adds, "women
are in increased risk of contracting the
virus and this may reduce the potential
benefits of male circumcision on HIV
transmission." .
Another fear is that the rate of female
genital mutilation in areas where the
practice exists may shoot up if men's circumcision
is linked to HIV prevention.
Equally emotive arguments have
raised ethical questions about the age at
which a person needs to be circumcised
for the practice to be effective.
There are worries that older men may
be left out in the strategy, since studies
elsewhere in Africa show that circumcision,
as a measure against HIV infection,
is more effective if done before or soon
after puberty begins.
In a 1999 research on the age of male
circumcision and HIV infection risk in rural
Uganda, 'Kelly Kiwanuka found that
males circumcised before puberty - between
13 and 20 - had a much reduced
risk compared with their uncircumcised
counterparts.
