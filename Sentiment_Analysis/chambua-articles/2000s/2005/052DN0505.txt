The poor’s appeal to the G8
Help end poverty for war on Aids to
succeed, slum dwellers tell the rich

By LUCAS BARASA
The rich nations were yesterday told to
help end poverty in the world for the
fight against Aids to succeed.
Residents of Nairobi’s Kibera, which
is regarded as Africa’s biggest slum and
where most of the city’s poor live, told a
team travelling on bus collecting views
on poverty from around Africa, that the
eradication of the epidemic would be a
pipe dream if poverty persisted.
The bus started its journey in South
Africa on March 31
and arrived in Kenya
on May 1. The views
being collected on poverty,
debt, HIV/Aids
and trade will be forwarded
to a meeting of
the world’s most industrialised
countries
(G8), in Scotland on July 6.
Ms Rebecca Wabwoba, an Action-
Aid International official, said the vehicle
will be in Nakuru today on its way
to Eldoret and Busia — and on to
Uganda. ActionAid has organised the
tour as part of the Global Action
Against Poverty campaign.
Tanzania, Malawi and Mozambique
are some of the countries the bus has
visited.
“The issues raised will be analysed, a
report produced and a video copy presented
to the G8 leaders,” said the
ActionAid official in charge of the
HIV/Aids programme in Africa, Mr
Leonard Okello.
Yesterday, the slum dwellers regretted
that, unlike in rich countries where
people living with the disease live longer,
in Kenya most patients die early due
to lack of basic needs and access to lifeprolonging
drugs.
“If we could get better food, clean
water and better healthcare and our
economy improved we would be able to
reduce stress and trauma that hasten our
death once we catch Aids,” Mr Enock
Oyier said.
Twenty-nine-year-old Emily Anyona,
who said she had been living with HIV
for years, named treatment as key
among the things she wanted to get from
the G8.
“Yes, I have heard of countries like
America. They should help us get treatment.
The poor living conditions
we are in only
worsens our sickness,” she
said when a member of the
team asked her if she was
aware of the G8.
The residents, most of
them unemployed, casual
labourers and hawkers,
said their monthly incomes were less
than Sh1,000, and that rent consumed
Sh600, leaving them with too little to
raise the Sh500 needed monthly for the
anti-retrovirals (cheap drugs).
“Our landlords are rich men and they
rarely come here. They only use agents
to collect rent. We have no toilet facilities
and rely on what you call flying toilets;
we lack clean water supply, the
drainage system is poor and sanitation
pathetic,” Mr Alfred Sichangi said.
Although they want donors to cancel
Kenya’s debts, the Government should
show commitment to eradicating poverty
and properly use the available
resources, they said.
Better housing, food and water supply,
more jobs and the improvement of
the infrastructure such as roads are some
of the issues they said should be given
priority.
