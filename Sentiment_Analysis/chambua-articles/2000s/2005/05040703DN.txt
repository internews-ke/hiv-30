{"text": "Daily Nation/ Thursday, April 7, 2005\r\n\r\nMOST COMMON CAUSES OF DEATH\r\n\r\nThe survival and well-being of mothers\r\nand children is central to solving\r\neconomic, social and developmental\r\nchallenges. When mothers and children\r\ndie or are sick, their families, communities and\r\nnations suffer as well. Improving the survival and\r\nwell being of mothers and children will not only\r\nincrease the health of societies, but also\r\ndecrease inequity and poverty.\r\nApproximately 3,000 to 6,000 Kenyans die\r\nyearly from pregnancy related complications.\r\nThis translates into about ten large passenger\r\naircraft crashing annually. In Kenya, the lifetime\r\nrisk of dying due to a pregnancy related condition\r\nis 1 for every 20 pregnancies. This does not\r\ncompare favourably with developed countries\r\nwhere the risk of dying in childbirth has been\r\ntremendously reduced over the years.\r\nChild-bearing related deaths are the commonest\r\ncause of death among women aged 15-49 years,\r\ncontributing to 27 per cent of the deaths in this\r\nage-group. Additionally, for every maternal death\r\n30,000 women suffer chronic illnesses and\r\ndisability associated with pregnancy and\r\nchildbirth which include obstetric fistula,\r\nparalysis, and infertility among others.\r\nThese figures are unjustifiably high since\r\nmaternal death is preventable even in resource\r\npoor countries. The main causes of deaths\r\ninclude: severe bleeding obstructed labour,\r\neclampsia, unsafe abortion and infections.\r\nProblems of malaria, anaemia and STI/HIV/Aids\r\nalso contribute to the high maternal morbidity and\r\nmortality in Kenya. Mothers die because of\r\ndelivery with unskilled persons, delay in seeking,\r\naccessing and receiving care. All the above\r\nfactors are contributed by poverty, socio-cultural,\r\neconomic and gender issues, due to lack of\r\nwomen empowerment.\r\nIn response to this scenario, Kenya is\r\nsignatory to the attainment of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) especially goal\r\nnumber 5, which is specific to maternal and\r\nnewborn health.\r\nLikewise, the Ministry of Health has put in\r\nplace policies, standards and guidelines and\r\nstrategies targeting the improvement of maternal\r\nand newborn health. Some of these documents\r\ninclude: Safe Motherhood and Newborn Health\r\nProgram Guidelines, National Reproductive\r\nHealth Strategy, National Standards on Maternal\r\nHealth and Clinical Audit Guidelines, National\r\nReproductive Health Policy document,\r\nGuidelines for facility based Maternal and\r\nPerinatal death audit, Capacity building for\r\nservice providers to provide essential obstetric\r\ncare, including their recruitment, strengthening\r\nhealth facilities countrywide to provide quality\r\nBasic Essential Obstetric Care and\r\nComprehensive Essential Obstetric Care.\r\nPMTCT interventions have been factored in\r\nmaternal and newborn health programs since on\r\naverage nine per cent of pregnant women are\r\nHIV positive. Maternal Death Reviews are in\r\nplace in our health facilities (both public and\r\nprivate) in order to understand clearly why\r\nmothers are dying during pregnancy and\r\nchildbirth, and institute remedial measures. The\r\nMinistry of Health is also in the process of\r\nmaking Maternal Death a notifiable condition.\r\nCommunity mobilisation strategies have been\r\ninitiated to mobilize communities to seek safe\r\nmotherhood and neonatal services.\r\nWhat can communities do to improve maternal\r\nand newborn outcome? They should:\r\nUnderstand that pregnancy is a risky condition\r\nand the need to be prepared for any\r\ncomplications by making a birth- plan, contribute\r\ntowards transport for emergency referrals, and\r\nsupport the facilities within their localities.\r\nGlobally, 29,000 children are dying daily of\r\npreventable causes. In Kenya, the under-five\r\nmortality rate has increased from 110 \ufffd 115\r\ndeaths/ per 1000 live births from between 1998\r\nand 2003. The major causes of illnesses and 70\r\nper cent of the deaths are malaria, acute\r\nrespiratory tract infections, pneumonia,\r\ndiarrhoea, measles, malnutrition, skin infections\r\nand intestinal worms. prenatal and maternal\r\ncauses and HIV/aids related diseases also\r\ncontribute significantly.\r\nIn response to the deteriorating child health\r\nindicators, the Ministry of Health has adopted the\r\nintegrated management of childhood illnesses\r\nstrategy that aims at providing the first level\r\nhealth worker with skills and enabling\r\nenvironment to recognize and treat minor\r\nconditions, and promptly refer severe cases for\r\nfurther management after providing emergency\r\ncare. In addition an adaptation has been made to\r\ninclude recognition and management of\r\nsymptomatic HIV infection and vitamin A\r\nsupplementation for all the children below 5\r\nyears of age. Every child is examined for\r\nmalnutrition and the caretaker counselled\r\naccordingly. In addition the child\ufffds immunization\r\nstatus is determined and vaccines given at the\r\nfacility thus reducing chances of missed\r\nopportunity for immunisation.\r\nAs we commemorate this year\ufffds World Health\r\nDay, I take this opportunity to thank Kenyans and\r\nour partners for their efforts towards saving\r\nmother\ufffds and children\ufffds\ufffd lives and urge them to\r\npress on towards the achievement of the MDGs.\r\nLastly, the Ministry of Health is committed to\r\ncontinue working with key Government Ministries\r\nand Partners to ensure that we join forces and\r\nact to ensure that every \ufffdmother and child\ufffd\r\ncounts. In order to make a difference, we must all\r\njoin forces and act. Together we can do it. Each\r\none of us has a role.\r\n\ufffd Charity Ngilu,\r\nMinister for Health\r\nBy RACHEL N. MUSOKE\r\n.\r\n\ufffdThe future will be healthier and more productive for all\r\nsocieties if we act now to make every mother and child\r\ncount\ufffd\r\n*** The millennium development goals for the period 1990 to\r\n2015 focus on a number of interrelated issues that\r\nspecifically cover whole populations. As of now,\r\nremember that almost 15 years are gone and 10 years\r\nare left. What have we achieved on all or the goals that\r\nspecifically affect mothers and children \ufffd namely goal 1 on\r\npoverty and hunger; goal 4 on child mortality; goal 5 on maternal\r\nhealth? The answer is very little or none.\r\nWhen we talk of survival, it is important to think intact survival,\r\nthat is no or at the most minimal disability. For every mother or\r\nchild who die, there are several who are left with life-long\r\ndisability. Many disabled people cannot perform as well as others\r\nin nation-building. The causes of death and disability in mothers\r\nand children are to a large extent preventable or treatable.\r\nIn Kenya, child deaths have been increasing over the years.\r\nCurrent figures show that for every 1,000 children born alive,\r\nabout 115 do not reach their fifth birthday. Probably, an equal\r\nnumber are born dead. Parents will want to replace the dead ones\r\nas soon as possible thus compromising mother\ufffds health. This\r\ninevitably leads to high mortality among the mothers.\r\nJust imagine: nearly 40 per cent of child deaths occur in the\r\nfirst month of life; two thirds of these dying in the first week and\r\nthe majority in the first 24 hours of birth. These deaths are just\r\nnumbers to most of us. The baby is yet to acquire a name. Most\r\nof these deaths are due to baby being born too small (low birth\r\nweight) failure to breathe/ cry at birth (birth asphyxia) and severe\r\ninfections. Continue to imagine that globally, for every two people\r\nwho die in a traffic accident, one mother and 20 children die of\r\npreventable and treatable conditions. The deaths due to accidents\r\nmake it to the newspapers but deaths of mothers and children\r\nhardly ever. In every country including Kenya the poorest families\r\nsuffer the greatest burden.\r\nThe main underlying factor in all these deaths is malnutrition\r\n(under nutrition). The estimates are that up to 60 per cent of the\r\ndeaths in children the underlying cause in malnutrition. But\r\nunfortunately in medical records or even on death certificates, this\r\ncause is not often reported. What will be recorded is malaria,\r\npneumonia etc. Malnutrition is a silent killer.\r\nThe cycle of malnutrition through one\ufffds life cycle perpetuates\r\npoverty. Malnourished individuals cannot perform as well as the\r\nwell nourished ones. Hence their earning capacity is\r\ncompromised. As a result, child\r\ncare and nutrition is inadequate.\r\nChildren who are malnourished\r\nperform poorly in school and are\r\nmore likely to drop out of school.\r\nThey carry on the cycle into the\r\nnext generation.\r\nLets look at malnutrition an a\r\nlittle more detail. Mothers who are\r\npoorly nourished throughout their\r\nlife are likely to become stunted\r\nadults. They are likely to have low\r\nbirth weight babies but if the baby\r\nis big they get difficult and\r\nobstructed labour. The malaria\r\nand other infections tend to be\r\nmore severe. Survival for both is\r\nin jeopardy.\r\nFrom the afore mentioned, we\r\ncan see that mothers\ufffd health is a nation\ufffds wealth. Women carry the\r\nburden of looking after everybody in the family, food production may\r\nbe in their hands as well as other economic activities. A nation that\r\ndoes not look after their women is going to be a poor nation. Healthy\r\nmothers means less spending on health budget for the family as\r\nwell as nationally. When we read that people are selling property in\r\norder to pay for health, we see a sick nation that may never alleviate\r\npoverty.\r\nSo what can we improve the situation? \ufffdMake every mother and\r\nchild count\ufffd Get involved irrespective of our work and trade.\r\nStart with your home/ family. Although this message is on\r\nmothers and children, men/ fathers are part of the pack. Behind a\r\nsuccessful family there should be a man. Men need to play their\r\nroles as head of the family. Although most single parent households\r\nare headed by women who really struggle to keep the family, there\r\nis a father to these children. Men, do not just come to claim body\r\nand property after death be there to prevent the death. If men and\r\nwomen made choices together, it is highly likely that the whole\r\nfamily will remain healthy. Decide on the number of children you can\r\ncomfortably support, use appropriate and sure methods of planning\r\nyour family. Optimal care for the young child in the home includes\r\nexclusive breast feeding for six months, appropriate and nutritious\r\ncomplementary food thereafter in addition to breast milk. The rest of\r\nthe family is not forgotten in terms of food and hygiene. When one is\r\nliving on meager resources then one needs to be very innovative in\r\nterms of feeding the family.\r\nIf you are in a community and all of us are, do not wait for people\r\nfrom outside to organise you, to tell you what to do. You know the\r\ncommunity better than anybody else. Identify your\r\nproblems and try to find solutions. Do not wait for\r\nthe government to do things for you \ufffd you can do\r\nwithout them.\r\nIf you are a leader of any sort, work with groups\r\nin your community. Not as a boss but as a partner.\r\nAssist them to understand and recognise their\r\nstrengths. Enable them to take control and improve\r\nthe health of the community. Do not encourage a\r\nhand me down attitude. Let people work for their\r\ndues. The money we get from donors was earned\r\nby someone and it comes with strings.\r\nFor the health professional, there is a lot that\r\ncan be done even with the limited budgets. There\r\nis a wealth of information that is not passed on to\r\nclients. There is this word called empowerment of\r\nthe people to take care of themselves. Can client\r\neducation be part and parcel of care. Client - health\r\nworker contact is high but education/discussion is\r\nlow.\r\nThe claim is that there is no time. It is upon the\r\nworkers to create time for this activity. Preventive\r\nactivity takes less time but the yield is high.\r\nMortality and morbidity has to be reduced through\r\nnobody else but the health professionals. If each\r\nhealth worker spent five to 10 minutes per work\r\nshift a lot of messages will reach the clients. Surely\r\nthis is not too much to ask. Give it a try. But before\r\nyou give the message, ensure that the information you have is up\r\nto date.\r\nA number of clients are confused by conflicting information\r\nfrom health workers. Encourage health seeking behaviour of all\r\nyou come into contact. Tell them that it is cheaper to report early\r\nis the course of the disease than coming late. Encourage people\r\nto ask questions. Show them the value of preventing illness. Talk\r\nabout the common causes of illness and death and how they can\r\nbe prevented through good nutrition, hygiene and immunisation.\r\nIn the long run it will be cheaper for them and the quality of life will\r\nbe better. Be confident at the same time kind and respectful of all\r\nyou treat and care for.\r\nThe health care facility: Equipping and care of the equipment is\r\none thing that plagues health care facility. Sometimes it is the\r\npersonnel that handle equipment badly sometimes it is the\r\nmaintenance that is lacking. Is the facility always ready for\r\nemergencies? Are the personnel trained to deal with\r\nemergencies? Have guidelines in place so that all workers are\r\nclear on what to do in specific situations.\r\nThere are effective interventions to reduce mother and child\r\nmortality. These include skilled care during pregnancy and child\r\nbirth; appropriate feeding of mother, infant and child; prevention of\r\nillness through hygiene, immunisation of mother and baby, use of\r\ninsecticides and bed nets and many more; early and adequate\r\ntreatment of diseases. If we act now and through the days,\r\nmonths and years we will reduce the carnage. Let\ufffds not stop\r\naction on world health day.\r\nWomen\ufffds Well-Being:\r\nA Nation\ufffds Wealth"}
