By NATION Correspondent
The Kenya Rally Team (KRT) organised
Inter Media rally will become a permanent
fixture over the Easter Holiday, it has
been announced.
The chairman of KRT, John Ngunjiri, said yesterday
the idea of having the rally over Easter was
aimed at filling the void left by the Safari Rally.
He said the move would also create a bigger impact
for the media event, which started four years ago.
We want to set a bigger appeal and participation.
The media event should become one of the key
competitions on the calendar of motor sports in the
country,” he said.
Ngunjiri who is a veteran rally driver added that
discussions with various sponsors and organisers of
the Kenya National Rally championship (KNRC)
had already started over the Easter dates.
He added that it would be in the interest of would
be sponsors to know that the Inter Media rally is
permanently set for Easter.
Ngunjiri further disclosed that preparations for the
second round of the Inter Media rally have been
finalised with the event due to be held in Athi
River between October 8 and 10. Media organisations
expected include the Nation Media Group,
the Standard Group, Kameme, Citizen TV and
Radio, KBC and Family TV.
“There are indications that the second round of the
event will be very competitive.” said Ngunjiri. During
the first leg in April this year, the Nation Media
Group dominated scooping the overall prize. They
were closely followed by Standard, KTN and Kameme.
Proceeds from the event will go towards purchasing
drugs for children at the New Life Hope in Nairobi.
In April, a total of Sh300,000 was spent on purchasing
Anti Retroviral for children with HIV Aids at
the home.
