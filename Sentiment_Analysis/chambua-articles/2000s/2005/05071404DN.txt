{"text": "DAILY NATION\r\nThursday, July 14, 2005\r\nDoctor blamed in Aids case\r\nSacked worker says HIV results given to employer without her consent\r\n\r\nBy JILLO KADIDA\r\nA woman with Aids said a hospital\r\nrevealed her HIV status to her employer\r\nwithout her consent, causing her to be\r\nsacked.\r\nThe 42-year-old was testifying yesterday\r\nin a case in which she has sued\r\nHome Park Caterers for unlawful\r\ndismissal.\r\nAids activists jammed courtroom\r\nNumber Two at Nairobi Law Courts\r\nwhere the case was being heard. They\r\nwere all wearing T-shirts with the words\r\n\ufffdprotect women\ufffds rights\ufffd printed on\r\nthem.\r\nThe mother of three\r\ntook to the witness box\r\nin an open court and\r\nnarrated how her\r\nformer workmates hovered\r\naround the corridors\r\nwaiting for her to\r\nbe sacked.\r\nAccording to her, her\r\ncolleagues appeared to know what was\r\nhappening but none of them wanted to\r\ntell her. She asked her employer what\r\nthe problem was, but her bosses also\r\ndeclined to tell her.\r\nBut her letter of termination said she\r\nwas dismissed on medical grounds\r\nbecause she had incurred high bills at a\r\nhospital. It further said investigations\r\nshowed that she was unwell and unfit to\r\nperform her duties.\r\nAfter receiving the letter, she said she\r\nvisited the Metropolitan Hospital to\r\nrequest for her medical report. Only\r\nthen did she know that she was\r\nHIV-positive.\r\nYesterday, she said her sacking violated\r\nher rights. According to her, the\r\nHIV test conducted without her consent\r\nhad also violated her right to privacy.\r\nDr Primus Ochieng\ufffd, who performed\r\nthe test and the hospital also disclosed\r\nthe results to her employer without her\r\nconsent or knowledge.\r\nThe doctor also violated her rights by\r\nfailing to counsel her before conducting\r\nthe test and for failing to disclose the\r\noutcome to her after the results were\r\nready.\r\nNow she wants the court to declare\r\nthat it is wrong for an employee to be\r\nsacked for being HIV positive; that an\r\nHIV test cannot be undertaken without\r\none\ufffds consent and that the results should\r\nnot be disclosed to a third party without\r\none\ufffds consent.\r\nShe further wants the\r\ncourt to order that she\r\nbe reinstated or paid\r\nfor exemplary damages.\r\nIn her testimony, she\r\nsaid she visited Metropolitan\r\nHospital twice\r\nin April 2002 complaining\r\nof chest pains and\r\nrashes and was given medication.\r\nA week later, she went back after she\r\nfailed to get better and was tested for\r\nHIV without her consent.\r\nEven after the test was conducted, she\r\nstill did not know of it until she was dismissed\r\nfrom her job, she said. Dr\r\nOchieng\ufffd had said in his affidavit that\r\nshe was his patient and that she knew\r\nher status in March 2002.\r\nThe woman denied the claim saying\r\nshe just visited the hospital and at no\r\ngiven time did she consent to the test.\r\nShe further said she did not know her\r\nstatus as claimed by Dr Ochieng\ufffd.\r\nAccording to her testimony, she was\r\nnot given any pre-test and post-test\r\ncounselling.\r\nHearing of the case will resume on\r\nJuly 22."}
