{"text": "Daily Nation/ Thursday August 11, 2005\r\n\r\nDanger in monkey business\r\nCONTINUED FROM PAGE 29\r\n\r\nis among humans or its longterm\r\neffects.\r\nSo far, only about 40 people\r\nare known to carry the virus,\r\nincluding African bushmeat\r\nhunters and zoo and lab workers\r\nin North America.\r\nThe authors suspect many\r\nmore people have been\r\ninfected in Asia where\r\nhumans and primates come in\r\nclose contact. Some 700,000\r\ntourists visit four monkey\r\ntemples just in Bali each year.\r\nOf those, an estimated 35,000\r\nvisitors are bitten, according\r\nto the study in last month\ufffds\r\nEmerging Infectious Diseases,\r\na journal of the US Centres\r\nfor Disease Control and Prevention.\r\n\ufffdWe\ufffdre talking about a significant\r\nnumber of people, and\r\nwe\ufffdre talking about people\r\nwho then leave the next day\r\nand travel ... around the\r\nworld,\ufffd said Gregory Engel,\r\nco-author of the study.\r\nThe authors say people who\r\nhave been bitten or scratched\r\nby monkeys should not\r\nbecome alarmed, especially\r\nsince there is no easy way to\r\ntest for the virus in humans.\r\nHowever, scientists question\r\nhow SFV could react when\r\nmixed with HIV, tuberculosis\r\nor other human diseases.\r\nIt\ufffds also unclear how SFV\r\ncould behave in humans over\r\ntime. SFV is genetically different\r\nfrom the virus in primates\r\nthat\ufffds believed to have\r\nemerged as HIV, but the\r\nauthors say there\ufffds no guarantee\r\nSFV won\ufffdt alter and eventually\r\nbecome harmful to\r\nhumans.\r\nThe virus that causes Aids is\r\nbelieved to have passed from\r\nprimates to people in Africa decades\r\nbefore it began sickening\r\npeople in the 1980s. There is no\r\nevidence SFV has been transmitted\r\namong people.\r\nWilliam M. Switzer of the CDC\ufffds\r\nDivision of HIV/Aids Prevention\r\nsaid more studies are needed on\r\nhow widespread SFV is and on\r\nthe likelihood of human-tohuman\r\ntransmission of crossspecies\r\ninfections. \ufffdThe public\r\nhealth implications of SFV in\r\nhumans are also not fully\r\nknown,\ufffd said Switzer, who has\r\nresearched SFV but did not take\r\npart in this study.\r\nThe researchers say SFV may\r\nnever become harmful to\r\nhumans, but could be an indicator\r\nthat other viruses may jump\r\nmore easily from monkey to man.\r\nAsia is familiar with cross-species\r\ninfection from acute respiratory\r\nsyndrome, or SARS, which is\r\nbelieved to have first jumped\r\nfrom animals to people in China;\r\nit killed nearly 800 people worldwide.\r\nThe region is now battling\r\navian flu in which poultry has\r\ninfected humans, killing at least\r\n60 people since 2003.\r\n\ufffdWe\ufffdve opened up a whole new\r\ncontinent where we need to seriously\r\nconsider that there are\r\nviruses and pathogens that can be\r\ncommunicated between primates\r\nand humans,\ufffd Engel said of the\r\nfirst SFV case found in Asia.\r\n\ufffdWe\ufffdre talking about billions of\r\npeople and millions of primates\r\nand the possibility of unknown\r\npathogens being out there and a\r\nvery real mechanism whereby\r\nthose pathogens can flow.\ufffd\r\nThe authors say people can still\r\nvisit monkey temples, but close\r\ncontact should be avoided. They\r\nadvise wearing pants, not taking\r\nfood inside and never coming\r\nbetween a mother monkey and\r\nher young."}
