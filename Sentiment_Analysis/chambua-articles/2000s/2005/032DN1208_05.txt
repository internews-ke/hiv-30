New seeds to boost
Africa’s food output

By PETER APPS
As he scans the landscape around
him, all Sam Guemba can see are
maize crops standing stunted and
withered.
But there’s an exception. A
few fields shine green and fertile
— the first fruit of a process aid
workers hope will alleviate the
shortages endemic in southern
Africa.
At Nhampuguane in the southern
Mozambican Guija district,
the World Food Programme
(WFP) is working with US religious
agency Samaritans’ Purse
to encourage subsistence farmers
to switch from maize to cassava
and sweet potato plants.
These are better suited to the
marginal southern African climate
because they need less
water.
“Here they have tried to irrigate
the maize field,” says Guemba,
a Samaritans’ Purse aid
worker. “It has still died because
maize needs so much water.”
Less than 100 metres away
from the dead maize, cassava and
sweet potato plants are growing
well. In Mozambique, the failure
of rains early this year as the staple
maize harvest ripened has left
millions facing hunger, malnutrition
and, in some cases, death.
Drought has also affected a
region suffering the strains of
chronic poverty and the HIV
pandemic.
Under a food-for-work scheme
in Guija, some 200 kilometres
(120 miles) north of Maputo,
residents receive food handouts
in return for work on the project,
aimed at providing seeds and
cuttings to allow them to grow
the crops.
“Maize itself
was introduced
from outside a
long time ago,”
says Guemba.
“These are not
very traditional
crops, but people
here used to eat them once. And
if you look around here, the only
thing that is surviving is cassava.
You can eat the tubers and the
leaves make a nutritious sauce.”
Cuttings from one cassava
plant can be used to start as
many as 14 new plants and it
grows almost twice as fast as
maize.
Aid workers hope that once
rain starts it can quickly be
planted and used to alleviate
shortages later in the year as
southern Africa’s “hungry season”
bites. Around Guija, officials
say only 2 per cent of the
harvest was usable when it was
taken in during April.
The WFP says 10 million people
in the region face shortages.
For some in Lesotho, Zimbabwe,
Zambia, Malawi, Swaziland and
Mozambique, it is their third or
fourth successive bad harvest.
Most will make it through, but
others will die of hunger or from
diseases that overpower weakened
systems.
Families will
sell more property
— including
cattle and
tools — pushi
n g t h e m
deeper into
poverty and reducing next year’s
output, too. Hunger and drought
feed off each other, deepening
poverty in a variety of ways.
Aids has robbed many families
of their older generation and,
with them, the know-how to nurture
crops through harsh seasons.
Irrigation channels left in
Mozambique by Portuguese settlers
fell into disrepair during the
two decades of civil war that followed.
