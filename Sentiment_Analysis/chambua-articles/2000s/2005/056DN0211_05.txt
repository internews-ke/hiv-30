HIV woman’s suit is deferred

By NATION Correspondent
The hearing of a case filed by a
HIV-positive woman against
her former employer over
unlawful dismissal has been
adjourned.
High Court judge J.B. Ojwang put the
case off yesterday until this morning
after one of the parties made an application
which was not heard in an open
court. Lawyer Christopher Nzili, who is
representing Home Park Caterers in
the case, requested that he be allowed
to make an application in chambers
before the hearing could start.The
woman has sued Home Park Caterers,
Nairobi’s Metropolitan Hospital and
Dr Prismus Ochieng who she accuses
of failure to give her counselling prior
to the test. She accuses the hospital and
the doctor of conducting HIV tests on
her without her knowledge.
