Powerful Gulf cartel behind the
Dumping the Kenyan passport and taking up an Arabic name in return for
By PETER NJENGA
and DAVID MACHARIA Last Saturday, 21-year-old
Kimutai Kigen walked into
the Nation Centre with a
peculiar request: “How can I
go to Qatar?
“I am desperate,” he said.
“The military is not recruiting. No club
is willing to take me in and I have to
survive. The government should assist
us go to Qatar,
Bahrain
or any
o t h e r
country.”
I f
Kimuta
i ,
f r o m
Eldama
Ravine, is
lucky, his
request will
reach the right
people — a cartel
of middlemen with
the right connections
in Kenya and Doha
which is behind the lucrative
trafficking of athletes
to Gulf states.
Within six months, Kigen
will have a new name, like
many in his peer group who are
quietly changing citizenship, bypassing
Athletics Kenya and the
laid out guidelines that spell out
what is required of an athlete before
he or she can change nationality and
represent an adopted country in international
competition.
His name, in the immigration files,
will become just another statistic since
his Kenyan passport will only be used to
enable him travel to Doha where he will
be issued with a brand new passport that
will even state that he was born in the
Gulf.
But as a safety measure, the clever
athletes are not surrendering their Kenyan
passports just yet or severing links
with their homeland although they are
not encouraged to invest heavily at
home.
Life in athletics’ Garden of Eden in
the oil-rich Qatar, with its unfavourable
weather conditions and terrain, can also
be tumultuous, as one Richard Yatich
found out.
Now going by the name Mubarak
Shami, Yatich briefly fell out with the
Kenyan cartel that deals with the export
of athletics talent. They did not want
him to compete in weekend crosscountry
meetings leading to the Kenyan
national championships-cum IAAF
Cross Challenge meeting where his
cover could have been blown.
Yatich, or Shami for that matter, had
won two weekend meetings, beaten
world marathon record holder Paul Tergat
at an international 15-kilometre
road race in Holland and was
determined to continue with competition
in Kenya to maintain his form.
On November 7 last year, Yatich won
the season opening weekend meeting at
Telkom Club on Nairobi’s Ngong Road,
prompting a foreman from Qatar to
make a quick phone call to relay the
news “home.”
Suddenly, there was keen interest in
this rising star.
Four weeks later, Yatich
repeated his winning
feat in Nyahururu and
concluded the year with
victory in the Baringo half
marathon. As a Qatari.
Eyebrows were being
raised.
Why was he continuing
to feature in local events
as a Qatari and how did
he acquire the Gulf
nation’s citizenship in the first place
without Athletics Kenya being
involved?
Yatich, we are told, had decided to
compete in Kenyan races despite advice
against this from his new paymasters in
Doha, the Qatari capital.
And as a deterrent, his new Qatari
passport was taken away by the powerful
cartel and the Qatari athlete was
warned of dire consequences should
he continue competing in Kenyan
events.
But, to cover up, Yatich
claimed that one of the reasons
his passport was
withdrawn was because
he had overshot his
hotel bill while in
Doha where he stayed
for six months early
last year when his
c i t i -
z e n -
ship was
b e i n g
processed.
But at the hotel, Yatich did very
little.
Doctors would come, take his blood
samples and return another day. They
wanted to make sure that he was fit and
healthy enough to become a Qatari.
Qatar has one of the highest life
expectancy rates of 73 years and one of
the lowest Aids prevalence rates of 0.09
percent. That is, in a population of
863,051 people 776 have been diagnosed
as HIV positive, according to the CIA
Factbook.
To call off the bluff, Yatich who still
holds his Kenyan passport, threatened
to go public.
Matters became pretty hot, prompting
a Kenyan fixer to talk him out of what
would have been a damaging thought.
Whether or not he was promised that
he would compete at the world
cross-country championships in France
last March as a Qatari could not be
ascertained.
However, on March 15, when the
Kenya team was departing to Saint
Etienne for the championships, Yatich
was given back his passport and reportedly
mollified with a cash compensation
on top of a free ticket to France.
His minders, led by Italian Canota
Canova who coaches athletes from
Qatar and Bahrain, had other plans for
him in a long term strategy to dominate
all athletics events in the world.
Like other Ethiopian and Kenyan
road racers that were being
recruited, Yatich had been
earmarked for marathon
running.
On May 19, Yatich
proved his worth by winning
the Vienna Marathon
and possibly a place in the
Qatar team for the Helsinki
world championships this
August.
Yatich is no longer the
pauper he was in his home
area of Eldama Ravine and
he has involved his friends
who, though still Kenyans,
are working for the Qatar
team at its training camp in
Iten, just
outside
Eldoret.
T h e s e
i n c l u d e
Joseph Cheromei,
brother of
Lydia Cheromei,
a former world
c r o s s - c o u n t r y
championships gold
medallist at junior
level.
David Cheromei, a
jovial young man,
was busy supervising
the installation of
electricity a proposed
camp for Qataris in
Iten when we caught
up with him last week.
We are told that the
f o r m e r K e n y a n
Qataris want to move
out of Sitet Hotel and
Kerio View, both in
Iten.
They included the
dozens of Kenyans who
have joined Qatar athletics
clubs.
Money is not an issue
for Qatar, one of the
world’s fastest growing
economies with the
highest per-capita
income and whose purchasing
power that of
the seven most industrialised nations.
Qatar has become the favourite destination
for young Kenyans with strong
legs.
Dumping the Kenyan passport and
taking up an Arabic name in return for
petro-dollars is not a major issue, we
were told by Saif Saaeed Shaheen, the
most prominent Kenyan defector to the
Gulf who opened the floodgates two
years ago.
The Kenyans have been joined by
their counterparts in Burundi, Brazil and
Ethiopia where no eyebrows are raised,
unlike Kenya, a country which is
losing its best athletes in
what is being referred
to as modern day
slave trade or
h u m a n
trafficking.
At the Sitet
Hotel, a recently
opened establishment,
the
new Qataris are
a common sight.
When they
are not training
or resting in their rooms or lazing
around the sleepy town, they spend most
of the time watching satellite television.
Take Faoud from Ethiopia, who likes
chewing roast maize, for instance.
He cannot make the grade in the usually
competitive Ethiopian team but the
first class training he receives in Iten,
Morocco, South Africa, Switzerland and
Brazil, where Qatar has training bases,
Faoud is a person with a
mission.
Aided by first class,
personalised training and
a huge budget, his world
is an oyster for Faoud.
At Sitet, he is on full
board accommodation at
a cost of Sh1,250 per day.
Those behind the now
lucrative talent drain are
doing rolling business,
our investigations reveal.
But the operation is so secretive that
recruits take an oath of allegiance not to
disclose what they know, were were told
by Shaheen in Iten last week.
“The chain is also so big and before
you reach the right people, money certainly
exchanges hands,” added the
former Cherono in an exclusive interview
at the exclusive Kerio View resort,
Iten, which hosts Qatari athletes at a fee
of Sh4,250 daily when they are in
training.
During this interview, Cherono or
Shaheen, depending on what you want
to call him, did not mind sharing a meal
with his former countryman, Kimutai
Kosgei, who has rented him a house in
the fashionable Elgon View suburbs in
Eldoret town.
Depending on his mood, the Qatari
star could also sleep at the Kerio View
where a meal goes for Sh750.
These are some of the benefits
poor Kenyans envy.
Two kilometres away,
Shaheen’s younger
brother, Jonathan, in
company of about a
dozen Kenyans wishing
either to break
into the international
circuit or defect to
the Gulf, had just
had a steamy meal
of ugali and sukuma
wiki in a
c o m m o n
room, previousl
y a
shop,
i n
front
o f
t h e i r
scarcely
furnished
s i n g l e
rooms.
T h e
athletes
then laze
by the roadside
whiling away
time until the afternoon
run.
Such scenes are replicated
in most shopping centres
in various parts of the
Rift Valley.
These boys fetch flour
and milk from their parents’
homes with a little
pocket money to buy
essential commodities.
