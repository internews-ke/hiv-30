UN praises Kenya’s Aids fight
Country gets pat on the back for reducing HIV infection rate to 7 p.c.

Kenya’s historic gains in the fight
against Aids were touted on Monday as
among the few encouraging points in a
bleak United Nations report on the global
pandemic.
The country’s success in rolling back
its HIV infection rate from 10 per cent
to seven per cent of adults marks “only
the second time in more than two decades
that a sustained decline in national
HIV infection levels has been seen in a
sub-Saharan African country,”
the UNAids agency
says in its 2005 update on
the epidemic.
Kenya has now matched
the achievement of
Uganda — the country
cited as the most effective
in the developing world in
controlling the spread of Aids.
The drop in HIV prevalence in Kenya
has been most dramatic among pregnant
women in urban areas, according to
UNAids.
Gains have been particularly impressive
in Busia, Meru, Nakuru and Thika,
where median HIV prevalence plummeted
from approximately 28 per cent
in 1999 to nine per cent in 2003.
The UNAids report attributes the
overall turnaround in Kenya partly to
behavioural changes.
Condom use with casual partners has
increased, most strikingly, among women,
the UN agency says.
In 2003, almost 24 per cent of Kenyan
women surveyed said they had used a
condom the last time they had casual
sex, compared with 15 per cent five
years earlier.
In addition, the proportions of men
and women with more than one sexual
partner were reduced more than half
during the decade ending in 2003.
More young Kenyans are also delaying
sexual debut, says UNAids.
“All this is occurring against the backdrop
of expanded HIV information campaigns,
voluntary counselling and testing
programmes and gradually improving
access to anti-retroviral therapy,” the
report observes.
The large number of Kenyans who
have died from Aids-related diseases has
also contributed to the
reduced prevalence of
H I V i n f e c t i o n s ,
UNAids points out.
Death rates from
Aids in Kenya may be
higher than the rates at
which new infections
are occurring, the
report suggests.
But the news in the UN report is not
all good for Kenya.
HIV infections are still alarmingly
common in Chulaimbo (14 per cent of
adults), Busia (16 per cent) and Suba (30
per cent), says the report.
Kenya’s achievement in generally
slowing the epidemic is especially noteworthy
in the context of black Africa —
home to more than 60 per cent of the 40
million people worldwide with HIV.
Black Africans will also account for
three-quarters of the 3.1 million Aidsrelated
deaths in the world this year.
Globally, the number of HIV-infected
persons has doubled in the past decade,
according to UNAids.
