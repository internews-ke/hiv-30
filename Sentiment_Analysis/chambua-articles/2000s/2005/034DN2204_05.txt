17 years of living with HIV
and getting better
A CALL FOR SUPPORT FOR THE NEW DRAFT CONSTITUTION FOR PEOPLE
INFECTED AND AFFECTED BY HIV/AIDS IN KENYA
People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHAs) stands at 1.6 million with 3.2 million being directly
affected. This is equivalent to 45% of all voters. I appeal for all of these people to vote as a
block for BANANA - YES on 21st November 2005 referendum for the following reasons:
(i) Guaranteed right to health means free access to life saving antiretroviral treatment
(ART) and essential drugs to fight opportunistic infections for all.
(ii) Guaranteed right to education means access to free education from pre-unit to primary
level for over 1m AIDS orphans and vulnerable children.
(iii) Guaranteed Bill of Rights will ensure discrimination against infected and affected
people will be outlawed. No more denial of jobs. No more sacking. No more
discrimination
(iv) Guaranteed representation of minority and disadvantaged groups in Legislative
Assemblies including women and youths opens the door for PLWHAs representation.
It is the best. It can not be better.
