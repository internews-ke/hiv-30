We didn’t sin, say HIV clerics
Infected church leaders say anybody can contract Aids-causing virus

By TONY KAGO
We did not sin to be infected with HIV,
church leaders who have gone public on
their health status said yesterday.
They said that, contrary to the belief
that Aids is a sinners’ disease, anybody
can contract it.
“There is no holy HIV; anybody can
get HIV,” said Fr Jape Heath, the chairman
of the African Network of Religious
Leaders Living with or Personally
Affected by HIV/Aids (Anerela). “It’s a
medical condition, not a moral issue.”
The South African priest is among
church leaders who disclosed their status
at a forum organised by the Kenya
Anerela chapter at a
Nairobi hotel on
Tuesday.
Taveta Anglican
vicar Gibson Mwanganyi
Mwadime said he
was infected through
contaminated blood,
but Fr Heath, Canon
Gideon Byamugisha of Uganda and
Tanzania’s Amin Sandewa said they did
not know when and how it happened.
The Rev Mwadime said revealing his
status to his family and then the public
was the greatest thing he had done in his
life.
The father of teenagers Emily and
Derrick described the pain of losing his
third-born to Aids in 1988.
He said he had been living with the
virus that causes Aids for more than 20
years, and that he was infected by his
wife soon after she underwent blood
transfusion during an operation.
Said Canon Byamugisha, who said he
had been living with HIV for 18 years:
“I do not know how and where I got to
be infected. All I know is that I knew I
was infected after being tested.”
Prodded further, he waxed philosophical:
“The only person who can be sure
of how he or she was infected is the one
who has never been injected, fed on
breast milk or had unprotected and frequent
sex with an infected person.”
“And even then,” he went on, “it matters
the amount of the virus in the body,
the presence of sores or cuts on the body
and the stage of infection.”
Said Fr Heath, who declined to be
drawn into discussing how he contracted
the virus: “The real issue is not how I got
infected, but how I am living with HIV.”
He said many clergymen had declined
to speak out because society believes that
only promiscuous people get infected.
“Living with HIV can be very lonely for
any religious leader in all but the most
loving religious communities,”
he said.
Many religious leaders,
he said, lived in
fear of being misunderstood,
misjudged,
isolated and discriminated
against. Pastor
Sandewa said most
faithful attached immorality to the disease
and viewed him negatively and with
a lot of suspicion. “But regardless of
whether I got it (HIV) through immorality
or not, the most important thing for
me right now is to live a positive and fulfilling
life.”
He said he had been discriminated
against by his church since he was
infected in 1999.
Kenya Anerela chairperson Anisia
Karanja said 24 HIV-positive church
leaders from all faiths had joined the
organisation since it was formed early
last year.
Mrs Karanja, a member of the Christian
International Church, said among
them are four Catholic priests and a similar
number of senior Muslim leaders.
Mrs Kauthar Bitok, a Muslim youth
leader and civil servant, blamed her religion
for the spread of the disease.
