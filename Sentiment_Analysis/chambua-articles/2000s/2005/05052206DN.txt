{"text": "Sunday Nation/ May 22, 2005\r\nBY LINA NJOROGE\r\nShedding light on the dilemma of weight loss\r\nWhen a person is not eating adequate\r\nfood portions or sometimes when\r\nthe food that they have eaten is not\r\nwell absorbed, weight loss can\r\noccur. The body hence draws from its reserve\r\nstores of energy, which mainly come from body\r\nfat and the muscle protein. Consequently, this\r\nleads to loss of body weight and muscle. Weight\r\nloss in adults is normally gradual and sometimes\r\nmay not be that obvious. But when a person\r\nloses about 10 per cent of their body weight or\r\nabout 6 to 7 kg in a month, then there is cause\r\nfor concern.\r\nIncreased requirements\r\nA person infected with HIV/Aids develops special\r\neating requirements and therefore needs to\r\nensure they are put on a balanced diet. This will\r\nhelp them meet their increased nutrient requirements\r\nand therefore maintain their nutritional\r\nstatus while avoiding the risks of weight loss.\r\nA person living with the virus has increased\r\nenergy and nutrient requirements as the body\ufffds\r\ndefence system tries to work hard to fight the\r\ninfection. Generally any infection will cause one\r\nto have fever which increases their body\ufffds\r\ndemand for food and nutrients. The three\r\nmain factors that cause weight loss and malnutrition\r\nin people with HIV/Aids are; reduced dietary\r\nor nutrient intake, reduced food and nutrient\r\nabsorption, and increased nutrient\r\nrequirements.\r\nIf these three major components are not\r\naddressed, weight loss and malnutrition is inevitable.\r\nWhen a person is malnourished, their\r\nimmune system becomes weak and therefore\r\nthey are not able to fight off infections. In the\r\ncase of HIV infection, malnutrition causes the\r\ndisease to progress faster to the Aids stage and\r\nas the disease progresses, opportunistic infections\r\nare increased. This in turn lowers the CD4\r\ncell count and the cycle continues. CD4 cells are\r\nthe cells that constitute the main body\ufffds\r\ndefence system. The HIV virus attacks these\r\ncells.\r\nMajority of people living with HIV/Aids are\r\nnot able to address these three components\r\neither due to ignorance or lack of financial\r\ncapacity to cope. Unfortunately medical nutritional\r\ntherapy has not been given the emphasis\r\nthat it deserves, considering that it is one of\r\nthe most important facets of the overall medical\r\nmanagement of HIV/Aids. Other reasons\r\nthat may cause weight loss and malnutrition in\r\npeople with HIV/Aids include;\r\n\u0001 The illness and drugs taken may reduce appetite\r\nor cause nausea.\r\n\u0001 Opportunistic infections coupled with other\r\nrelated symptoms such as sore mouth, oral thrush,\r\ndiarrhoea, painful chewing or swallowing due to the\r\nsores in the mouth or throat, definitely lower the\r\nvolume of food intake.\r\n\u0001 Loss of appetite due to depression, anxiety, isolation,\r\ntiredness, medication or even the disease\r\nitself.\r\n\u0001 HIV/Aids also reduces the absorption of food or\r\ncause the body not to absorb the food well (malabsorption).\r\nThe virus may damage the gut wall which\r\nthen affects the passage of food. When this happens,\r\nthen diarrhoea occurs as a result of food passing\r\nthrough the gut very quickly.\r\n\u0001 Eat more food by increasing your portions\r\nand also eating more frequently.\r\n\u0001 Increase foods from all the food groups to\r\nkeep to the recommended percentages.\r\nInclude staple foods such as maize, ugali, rice,\r\ngitheri, arrow roots, potatoes, millet, sweet\r\npotatoes or bananas.\r\n\u0001 Include beans, lentils, peas, groundnuts,\r\npeanuts or peanut butter and meats such as\r\nbeef, chicken, goat meat and fish. Minced\r\nmeat, fish and chicken of course are easier to\r\ndigest.\r\n\u0001 Eat snacks regularly between meals.\r\nChoose healthy snacks such as sandwiches\r\nwith rich fillings like peanut butter, fruit,\r\nyoghurt.\r\n\u0001 Increase your fat content gradually in your\r\nfood by adding more fat or oil. Make sure you\r\ndon\ufffdt eat excess fat as this may cause diarrhoea.\r\nHow to gain weight\r\n\u0001 Introduce more dairy products to your daily\r\nmeals such as sour milk, butter, yoghurt and\r\ncheese. Fermented drinks like milk or porridge\r\nare more tolerated by persons with diarrhoea.\r\n\u0001 Enrich your soups or porridge with powdered\r\nmilk, full cream milk, buttermilk, yoghurt.\r\nYou can add the same also to mashed foods,\r\ncereals and sauces.\r\n\u0001 Add sugar, honey, jam or syrup to your food\r\nor beverages.\r\n\u0001 Do not skip meals. Remember you can only\r\neat what the body is able to tolerate depending\r\non the symptoms being experienced.\r\nJust like early treatment of infections is important,\r\nthe same is even important for nutritional\r\nintervention. Seek nutritional help in the early\r\nstages of the disease so as to maintain adequate\r\nweight and live a positive life."}
