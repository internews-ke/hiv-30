Doctor blamed in Aids case
Sacked worker says HIV results given to employer without her consent

By JILLO KADIDA
A woman with Aids said a hospital
revealed her HIV status to her employer
without her consent, causing her to be
sacked.
The 42-year-old was testifying yesterday
in a case in which she has sued
Home Park Caterers for unlawful
dismissal.
Aids activists jammed courtroom
Number Two at Nairobi Law Courts
where the case was being heard. They
were all wearing T-shirts with the words
“protect women’s rights” printed on
them.
The mother of three
took to the witness box
in an open court and
narrated how her
former workmates hovered
around the corridors
waiting for her to
be sacked.
According to her, her
colleagues appeared to know what was
happening but none of them wanted to
tell her. She asked her employer what
the problem was, but her bosses also
declined to tell her.
But her letter of termination said she
was dismissed on medical grounds
because she had incurred high bills at a
hospital. It further said investigations
showed that she was unwell and unfit to
perform her duties.
After receiving the letter, she said she
visited the Metropolitan Hospital to
request for her medical report. Only
then did she know that she was
HIV-positive.
Yesterday, she said her sacking violated
her rights. According to her, the
HIV test conducted without her consent
had also violated her right to privacy.
Dr Primus Ochieng’, who performed
the test and the hospital also disclosed
the results to her employer without her
consent or knowledge.
The doctor also violated her rights by
failing to counsel her before conducting
the test and for failing to disclose the
outcome to her after the results were
ready.
Now she wants the court to declare
that it is wrong for an employee to be
sacked for being HIV positive; that an
HIV test cannot be undertaken without
one’s consent and that the results should
not be disclosed to a third party without
one’s consent.
She further wants the
court to order that she
be reinstated or paid
for exemplary damages.
In her testimony, she
said she visited Metropolitan
Hospital twice
in April 2002 complaining
of chest pains and
rashes and was given medication.
A week later, she went back after she
failed to get better and was tested for
HIV without her consent.
Even after the test was conducted, she
still did not know of it until she was dismissed
from her job, she said. Dr
Ochieng’ had said in his affidavit that
she was his patient and that she knew
her status in March 2002.
The woman denied the claim saying
she just visited the hospital and at no
given time did she consent to the test.
She further said she did not know her
status as claimed by Dr Ochieng’.
According to her testimony, she was
not given any pre-test and post-test
counselling.
Hearing of the case will resume on
July 22.
