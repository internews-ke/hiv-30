Dr Anzala has also thanked Kenyan\r\nvolunteers in the project and appealed for more\r\nto come forward as they embark on testing other\r\nvaccines.\r\nAbandoning vaccine\r\nTalking to Horizon, Dr Kambili said they are\r\nabandoning this vaccine and now working with\r\nscientists to start testing another candidate hopefully\r\nbefore the end of the year.\r\nDiscussion between the initiative and Vaccine\r\nResearch Centre of the National Institute of\r\nHealth of America, who have developed the vaccine,\r\nare said to be at an advanced stage.\r\nAt the moment, work is in process to prepare\r\nseveral centres at Kagemi, Kenya Medical\r\nResearch Institute\ufffds Kilifi station, and Kenyatta\r\nNational Hospital in preparation of other\r\nvaccines.\r\nStudies at the three sites are looking at the\r\nvarious blood parameters in preparation of these\r\nnew vaccines.\r\nProstitutes in Gambia\r\nThe decision to end further trials bring to and\r\nend several of years of research and more than\r\nfour years of the trying the vaccines safety and\r\nability to elicit immune responses.\r\nThe idea behind the development of this vaccine\r\nstarted more than 10 years ago and was\r\nbased on what Kenyan and scientists from Manitoba\r\nUniversity from Canada, observed among\r\nwomen prostitutes living in Majengo slums.\r\nThese women were not being infected even\r\nafter having unprotected sex, sometimes, with\r\ninfected men. It was later discovered they had\r\nspecific Killer T-Cells, which destroyed the HIV\r\nvirus, making them remain negative.\r\nResearchers from Oxford University saw similar\r\nresults among prostitutes in Gambia. With this\r\nknowledge, scientists from Oxford and University\r\nof Nairobi, decided to partner to develop the current\r\nvaccine that would prevent people from\r\nbeing infected with the HIV virus.\r\n\ufffdAn AWC-Feature"}
