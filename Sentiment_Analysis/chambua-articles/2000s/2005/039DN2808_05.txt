will also highlight the enormous
strength and character of
the entire Garissa Town. This
event is expected to provide an
exciting sports value for residents
and visitors.
Running on the unique course
throughout the streets of Garissa
will provide race participants
with a historic and cultural perspective
of the area.
“No sporting event of this magnitude
has been held in North
Eastern province,” said Mahmud.
“The Garissa Desert Run”
is a wonderful opportunity to get
people out to celebrate our great
Province, culture and heritage,
More sponsors are still expected
