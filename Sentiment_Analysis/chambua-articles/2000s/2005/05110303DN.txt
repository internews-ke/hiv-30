{"text": "Daily Nation/ Thursday November 3, 2005\r\n\r\nAids projects face cash crunch\r\nCONTINUED FROM PAGE 29\r\n\r\nFinance to enable it complete its work. \ufffdFor this\r\nreason, the disbursement of additional funds is significantly\r\nbehind schedule,\ufffd she added.\r\nEunice Muthamia of the public relations office at\r\nthe Ministry of Finance said, however, that the ministry\r\nhad done its part and the blame lay elsewhere.\r\nThe ministry is the principal recipient of these\r\nfunds, which are then distributed to the various\r\nimplementing agencies \ufffd mainly the Ministry of\r\nHealth and National Aids Control Council, though\r\nsome of it trickles down to NGOs. The ministry and\r\nthe council are supposed to account to the Treasury,\r\nwhile Kanco does so through the council.\r\nThe consortium\ufffds Lenya says they have already\r\nsubmitted their narrative and financial reports to\r\nthe council.\r\nBecause of the delay, programmes that were supposed\r\nto have been implemented by the end of this\r\nmonth are more than four months behind schedule.\r\nCouncil director Patrick Orege and the Ministry\r\nof Health\ufffds Tom Mboya say they have handed over\r\ntheir reports to Treasury \ufffd four months ago in the\r\ncase of the council.\r\nThe money has yet to arrive three weeks to the\r\ndeadline of phase one of this round.\r\nThe ministry has been embroiled in controversy\r\nover procurement processes and has a case pending\r\nin court over HIV testing kits.\r\nOrege says some of the delay may also be attributed\r\nto the time taken to put up structures before\r\nthe programmes could kick off.\r\n\ufffdWhen the Global Fund gave us money, we did\r\nnot have some systems in place and this led to\r\ndelays in starting our programmes,\ufffd he said. \ufffdWe\r\nare now working on ways to speed up movement of\r\nmoney to implementators of programmes.\ufffd\r\nNow a task force has been formed to look into\r\nthe cause of the delay, the implications and the\r\nsolution.\r\nSlow movement of funds \ufffd even stagnation \ufffd\r\nhas been a chronic problem in Kenya. It has also\r\naffected malaria and tuberculosis programmes.\r\nAt meeting in September that was chaired by\r\nZakary Ogongo, Permanent Secretary for health,\r\nand attended by Kristin Kalla and Victor Bampoe\r\nof the Global Fund, Kenya was warned that the\r\nfunding may be stopped.\r\nKalla, who has since left the fund, said the Kenyan\r\nexperience was marked by slow movement of\r\nfunds and low performance. \ufffdIf something is not\r\ndone to improve the situation, the programme may\r\nbe suspended,\ufffd she is reported to have said.\r\nThe fund representative also said they were concerned\r\nabout financial management systems. Meetings\r\nhad been held with the minister for health,\r\nduring which three fundamentals were agreed \ufffd\r\nthe need is there, funds are available but delivery\r\nprocesses are painfully slow.\r\nThe situation is no better when it comes to\r\nmalaria. On Monday, Director of medical services\r\nJames Nyikal told an international meeting in Nairobi\r\nthat all was well in the war against malaria, TB\r\nand Aids.\r\nHe said Kenya had placed an order, albeit belatedly,\r\nfor several million permanent treated mosquito\r\nnets through Unicef to manufacturers Vastergaard\r\nFandsen.\r\nStill, Kenya could find itself without nets in the\r\nnext malaria season.\r\nBut, according to Michael Bjornlund, Vestergaard\r\nFrandsen regional director for Europe and\r\nJapan, Kenya has yet to place a firm order for the\r\nnets. \ufffdThe Unicef order does not conform with\r\nour trading conditionalities,\ufffd Bjornlund told Horizon\r\nin Nairobi. \ufffdWe require that the buyer pays\r\n30 per cent of the purchase price before production\r\ncommences but Unicef and other UN agencies\r\ndo not place a deposit for purchases.\ufffd\r\nHealth minister Charity Ngilu was reportedly\r\ntold of the urgency in placing orders for both nets\r\nand the new malaria drugs called Artemisinin\r\nCombination Treatment at a high level meeting\r\nheld in Paris recently.\r\nAlthough it has been more than two years since\r\nthe Government adopted Coartem as the first line\r\ndrug in malaria treatment, it has yet to reach hospitals.\r\nThe lethargy in Government is a source of great\r\nfrustration in donor circles. Said Louis Da Gama\r\nof Massive Effort Campaign, an international\r\norganisation based in Swizerland: \ufffdIf Population\r\nServices International were not distributing nets\r\nin Kenya, the situation would be extremely bad.\ufffd\r\nPSI is funded directly by the British Department\r\nfor International Development. It sells the\r\nnets at a highly subsidised price. \ufffdWe are saying\r\nhere there is money to give your population nets\r\nfor free but several governments in Africa, including\r\nKenya, are not in a hurry to take up that\r\nchallenge,\ufffd Da Gama added.\r\nNACC has held several meetings with the ministry\r\nover the delayed funding. During the September\r\none chaired by Ogongo, members were\r\napprehensive that TB patients might go into crisis.\r\nThough approved, according to the minutes, TB\r\nfunding had yet to be released, \ufffddespite the disease\r\nbeing declared an emergency in the light of\r\nmulti-drug resistance strains. Any discontinuation\r\nof treatment will be detrimental to all gains\r\nmade.\ufffd\r\nThe Government is poised to apply for an\r\nextension of the programme for more than six\r\nmonths at no cost to the Fund.\r\nBecause the delay in applying for the funds is of\r\nthe Government\ufffds making, the understanding is\r\nthat it will absorb the costs of the extension,\r\nincluding monitoring and evaluation of the programme.\r\nNGOs are also expected to re-negotiate with\r\nErnst and Young for an extension to implement\r\ntheir programmes.\r\nMeanwhile, the council is now talking of seeking\r\ndirect support from the Global Fund and has\r\nsubmitted a formal request to the Government.\r\nThis might be tall order as the Fund finances governments\r\nand not piecemeal units within them."}
