Multi-drug resistant
TB cases confirmed

Centre for Disease Control of
America.
Their findings have been subjected
to a Supranational Reference
Laboratory in East Dulwich,
UK, which, in line with
WHO guidelines, is supposed to
test and establish if what Kemri
scientists found reflects the true
picture.
Dr Davy Koech, Kemri director,
says it is only after the UK
laboratory confirmed Kemri
findings that they can now be
released to the public. The
results, he adds, are interesting
because in 1995 when they did a
surveillance study that was published
by WHO, no MDR TB
was recorded.
To be published before the
end of the year in The International
Journal of Tuberculosis
and Lung Diseases, a senior Ministry
of Health official says the
findings have shocked and disappointed
his colleagues, some of
whom have all along argued that
things were not that bad.
In a letter reference No
DC/7/3/27, the Director of Medical
Services, Dr James Nyikal,
says whereas he is saddened by
the emergence of MDR TB, he is
pleased to report that the ministry
is planning to start an isolation
unit to cater for patients
with this strain.
Last year, the MoH denied
MDR TB existed in the country
in significant numbers when following
media reports of its existence
indicating that of the 149
TB patients who were referred to
Kemri by private and public hospitals
in Nairobi, 11.4 per cent
had multidrug TB resistant
strains.
The ministry was categorical
that the country’s MDR TB magnitude
was only 0.03 per cent,
which, they argued, did not warrant
an elaborate government
management response to the
problem.
It later emerged that the 0.03
per cent figure was the
same one cited in a ten
year review of TB drug
resistance in Kenya
published in the October
1993 East African
Medical Journal, Vol
70, No 10.
With these new findings,
Dr Koech says
health personnel will
have to be trained to master the
techniques of picking-out somebody
who is resistance to more
than one TB drug.
Dr Githui and Dr Meme-
Murerwa add that simple procedures
and characteristics to
diagnose a person with TB resistant
strains will have to be used
especially in resource poor settings.
Currently, testing of drug
resistance TB
c o s t s a b o u t
Sh3,500 at Kemri
while it is free in
public hospitals
to test for normal
TB strains.
T h e s e b a d
news comes at a
time the government
is preparing
to present a report to the Millennium
Development Goals meeting
in New York next week on
how it is managing HIV/Aids
related opportunistic infections.
TB is one of the major
opportunistic infections assaulting
HIV positive people.
It is also coming when some
European countries are requiring
that people wishing to travel thre
be screened for TB before being
issued with a visa.
But the biggest fear now is that
those who were found to have
MDR TB strains are freely mingling
with other people, and
spreading the strains. Majority of
them are too poor to raise even
0.1 per cent of the one million
shillings required to manage their
condition.
Although the government was
about four years ago alerted of
the issue of MDR TB and how to
help such poor patients access
medication, much of its policies
have not been translated into
action.
In 2002, the then Director of
Medical Services, Dr Richard
Muga, instituted a 20-person task
force to look into the matter,
after 30 people reported to
Kemri with the super TB strains.
“Sporadic cases of MDR-TB
have been notified to the
National Leprosy and Tuberculosis
Programme in the last quarter.
At least 30 patients are now confirmed
to have MDR-TB on sputum
and culture and sensitivity
done at Kemri,” said Dr Muga
then in a letter.
According to the letter, the
task force terms of reference
were to prepare guidelines for
registration and treatment of
MDR-TB; its prevention; and
surveillance.
As an immediate response, the
team was required to prepare an
application to the Global Fund
and the Green Light WHO committee
to enable Kenya access
funds and cheaper drugs to help
in the management of the strains.
