{"text": "30 Daily Nation/ Thursday September 8, 2005\r\n\r\nMulti-drug resistant\r\nTB cases confirmed\r\n\r\nCentre for Disease Control of\r\nAmerica.\r\nTheir findings have been subjected\r\nto a Supranational Reference\r\nLaboratory in East Dulwich,\r\nUK, which, in line with\r\nWHO guidelines, is supposed to\r\ntest and establish if what Kemri\r\nscientists found reflects the true\r\npicture.\r\nDr Davy Koech, Kemri director,\r\nsays it is only after the UK\r\nlaboratory confirmed Kemri\r\nfindings that they can now be\r\nreleased to the public. The\r\nresults, he adds, are interesting\r\nbecause in 1995 when they did a\r\nsurveillance study that was published\r\nby WHO, no MDR TB\r\nwas recorded.\r\nTo be published before the\r\nend of the year in The International\r\nJournal of Tuberculosis\r\nand Lung Diseases, a senior Ministry\r\nof Health official says the\r\nfindings have shocked and disappointed\r\nhis colleagues, some of\r\nwhom have all along argued that\r\nthings were not that bad.\r\nIn a letter reference No\r\nDC/7/3/27, the Director of Medical\r\nServices, Dr James Nyikal,\r\nsays whereas he is saddened by\r\nthe emergence of MDR TB, he is\r\npleased to report that the ministry\r\nis planning to start an isolation\r\nunit to cater for patients\r\nwith this strain.\r\nLast year, the MoH denied\r\nMDR TB existed in the country\r\nin significant numbers when following\r\nmedia reports of its existence\r\nindicating that of the 149\r\nTB patients who were referred to\r\nKemri by private and public hospitals\r\nin Nairobi, 11.4 per cent\r\nhad multidrug TB resistant\r\nstrains.\r\nThe ministry was categorical\r\nthat the country\ufffds MDR TB magnitude\r\nwas only 0.03 per cent,\r\nwhich, they argued, did not warrant\r\nan elaborate government\r\nmanagement response to the\r\nproblem.\r\nIt later emerged that the 0.03\r\nper cent figure was the\r\nsame one cited in a ten\r\nyear review of TB drug\r\nresistance in Kenya\r\npublished in the October\r\n1993 East African\r\nMedical Journal, Vol\r\n70, No 10.\r\nWith these new findings,\r\nDr Koech says\r\nhealth personnel will\r\nhave to be trained to master the\r\ntechniques of picking-out somebody\r\nwho is resistance to more\r\nthan one TB drug.\r\nDr Githui and Dr Meme-\r\nMurerwa add that simple procedures\r\nand characteristics to\r\ndiagnose a person with TB resistant\r\nstrains will have to be used\r\nespecially in resource poor settings.\r\nCurrently, testing of drug\r\nresistance TB\r\nc o s t s a b o u t\r\nSh3,500 at Kemri\r\nwhile it is free in\r\npublic hospitals\r\nto test for normal\r\nTB strains.\r\nT h e s e b a d\r\nnews comes at a\r\ntime the government\r\nis preparing\r\nto present a report to the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals meeting\r\nin New York next week on\r\nhow it is managing HIV/Aids\r\nrelated opportunistic infections.\r\nTB is one of the major\r\nopportunistic infections assaulting\r\nHIV positive people.\r\nIt is also coming when some\r\nEuropean countries are requiring\r\nthat people wishing to travel thre\r\nbe screened for TB before being\r\nissued with a visa.\r\nBut the biggest fear now is that\r\nthose who were found to have\r\nMDR TB strains are freely mingling\r\nwith other people, and\r\nspreading the strains. Majority of\r\nthem are too poor to raise even\r\n0.1 per cent of the one million\r\nshillings required to manage their\r\ncondition.\r\nAlthough the government was\r\nabout four years ago alerted of\r\nthe issue of MDR TB and how to\r\nhelp such poor patients access\r\nmedication, much of its policies\r\nhave not been translated into\r\naction.\r\nIn 2002, the then Director of\r\nMedical Services, Dr Richard\r\nMuga, instituted a 20-person task\r\nforce to look into the matter,\r\nafter 30 people reported to\r\nKemri with the super TB strains.\r\n\ufffdSporadic cases of MDR-TB\r\nhave been notified to the\r\nNational Leprosy and Tuberculosis\r\nProgramme in the last quarter.\r\nAt least 30 patients are now confirmed\r\nto have MDR-TB on sputum\r\nand culture and sensitivity\r\ndone at Kemri,\ufffd said Dr Muga\r\nthen in a letter.\r\nAccording to the letter, the\r\ntask force terms of reference\r\nwere to prepare guidelines for\r\nregistration and treatment of\r\nMDR-TB; its prevention; and\r\nsurveillance.\r\nAs an immediate response, the\r\nteam was required to prepare an\r\napplication to the Global Fund\r\nand the Green Light WHO committee\r\nto enable Kenya access\r\nfunds and cheaper drugs to help\r\nin the management of the strains.\r\n\ufffd An AWC-Feature"}
