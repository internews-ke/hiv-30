In this area you will be confronted by
horrendous health statistics. Upto 40% of the
morbidity is attributable to Malaria.
The Mission is to reduce this to 10% in two
years.
HIV/AIDS prevalence is more than 20%. The
Mission is to put everyone in this area under
ARV treatment.
Immunisation coverage is mere 60%. The
Mission is to raise this to 85%.
An innovative approach using a state of the art
mobile clinic will be implemented. We are
looking for a doctor who can share our vision
and work for the mission. Applications are
invited from a qualified general practitioner
who is ready to be based in Rarieda in Bondo
District for one year contract that is renewable.
Applications should be sent immediately
preferably by e-mail giving qualifications,
experience, referees and telephone contact not
later than 12th August 2005 (The earlier the
better)
