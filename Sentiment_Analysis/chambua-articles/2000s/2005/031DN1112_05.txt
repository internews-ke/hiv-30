Protect children from
Aids, says First Lady
By PPS
First Lady Lucy Kibaki has
called on adults to take full
responsibility in protecting children
from HIV/Aids.
She urged them to unite in
condemning and punishing sexual
violence, abuse and exploitation
of children.
Mrs Kibaki also called for
enactment and enforcement of
laws to protect children from
sexual violence.
The First Lady made the
remarks in a speech read by Prof
Elizabeth Ngugi during the
launch of the Kenya Chapter of
the Organisation of African First
Ladies’ continental campaign
against HIV/Aids at the Kenyatta
International Conference
Centre, Nairobi.
“This is a unique campaign
that focuses on sensitising adults
that it is their responsibility to
protect children from HIV/Aids
infection,” Mrs Kibaki said.
She said children have no
power and depend on adults for
protection from all dangers,
therefore the responsibility of
protecting children from infection
lies squarely on the hands of
adults.
The First Lady noted that
when the campaign against
HIV/Aids was launched at the
continental level during the
OAFLA General Assembly in
New York in September this
year, it was agreed that it could
prevent HIV infection among
children by embracing traditional
values of shared responsibility
for children.
In rolling out the campaign at
the national level, the First Lady
said the drive calls upon every
adult to treat every child as their
own, encourages parents and
guardians to talk to their children
about sex and guard against
adults infecting children.
Mrs Kibaki said her organisation
was ready to share messages
and materials for the campaign
against HIV/Aids with other
organisations involved in fighting
the pandemic.”Across the globe,
Aids is responsible for an
increasing number of deaths each
year,” Mrs Kibaki said.
She said that of the 3.1 million
people killed by the scourge globally
this year, over half a million
were children aged below 15
years, adding that at the end of
2004, an estimated 2.3 million
children were living with HIV.
Noting that children also get
infected through mother-to-childtransmission,
the First Lady
urged mothers to take appropriate
steps to ensure timely access
to medical services to avoid
exposing their children to the disease.
She also appealed for support
and care of Aids orphans.
She added that community
support is the final safety-net for
many children and should be nurtured
and strengthened.
During the occasion, the First
Lady donated over Sh400,000
and other Christmas gifts which
were presented to nine children’s
homes catering for orphans.
The homes also benefited from
a donation of shopping vouchers
worth Sh5,000 each from Nakumatt
Supermarket.
The orphans from the children’s
homes were later treated
to a luncheon sponsored by the
First Lady.
Present were National Aids
Control Council’s Deputy Director
Prof Alloys Orago and Clinton
HIV/Aids Initiative Country
Director Gerald Macharia among
others.
