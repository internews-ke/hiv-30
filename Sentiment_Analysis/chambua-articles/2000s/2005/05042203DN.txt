This is equivalent to 45% of all voters. I appeal for all of these people to vote as a\r\nblock for BANANA - YES on 21st November 2005 referendum for the following reasons:\r\n(i) Guaranteed right to health means free access to life saving antiretroviral treatment\r\n(ART) and essential drugs to fight opportunistic infections for all.\r\n(ii) Guaranteed right to education means access to free education from pre-unit to primary\r\nlevel for over 1m AIDS orphans and vulnerable children.\r\n(iii) Guaranteed Bill of Rights will ensure discrimination against infected and affected\r\npeople will be outlawed. No more denial of jobs. No more sacking. No more\r\ndiscrimination\r\n(iv) Guaranteed representation of minority and disadvantaged groups in Legislative\r\nAssemblies including women and youths opens the door for PLWHAs representation.\r\nIt is the best. It can not be better.\r\nJoe Muriuki.\r\nSecretary General"}
