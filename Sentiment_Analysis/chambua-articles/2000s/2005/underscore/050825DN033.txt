{"text": "Daily Nation/ Thursday August 25, 2005\r\n\r\nMalaria lessons now introduced in 1,000 schools\r\nCONTINUED FROM PAGE 31\r\n\r\nnel districts of Makueni, Bondo, Kwale, Kisii and\r\nGucha, and involves about 100,000 class seven\r\npupils in about 1000 primary schools.\r\nThe programme sponsored by Population Services\r\nInternational and supported by the local education\r\noffices has already developed various teaching aids\r\nand students\ufffd materials.\r\n\ufffdWith many malaria endemic rural areas characterized\r\nby illiteracy and poor access to information,\r\nthe program will use the pupils to disseminate \ufffdmalaria\r\ninformation\ufffd within their families and communities,\ufffd\r\nsays Bernard Muthaka of PSI.\r\nThe new initiative, say Mr Muthaka is a wider\r\nscheme to increase the usage of nets and consequently\r\nreduce the incidence of malaria. Demand\r\nfor nets has increased dramatically since the Ministry\r\nof Health introduced low-cost nets for mothers\r\nattending ante-natal clinics. The nets are sold for\r\nSh50.\r\nTo cover the unexpected surge in demand the British\r\nDepartment For International Development has\r\nupped it funding to the programme. The increased\r\nfunding was announced recently by DFID\ufffds director\r\nfor Africa, Mr Dave Fish at Ojolla dispensary in\r\nKisumu.\r\nThe British government is giving an additional 19.6\r\nmillion pounds (about Sh2.6 billion), with most of it\r\ngoing towards the purchase of more nets.\r\nOjolla dispensary is already selling 250 low-cost\r\nnets every month. The long-lasting nets that do not\r\nneed re-treatment are being distributed through\r\nantenatal clinics to pregnant mothers and children\r\nbelow five years.\r\nAccording to health officials, as a result of these\r\nnets , attendance at antenatal clinics has been on a\r\nsteady rise, with many women visiting clinics in\r\norder to get the low-cost nets. The clinic attendance\r\ncard acts as a voucher that enables one to buy\r\nthe net. In the commercial outlets, nets go for\r\nbetween 100 and 320 shillings.\r\nAccording to Ministry of Health sources, another\r\npicture is emerging: immunization rates are increasing\r\nas mothers attending ANC clinics are also getting\r\nimmunized, themselves and their children.\r\nAccording to the Nyanza Provincial Medical of\r\nHealth, Ojolla dispensary has recorded a 38 per\r\ncent increase in immunization rates since the nets\r\nwere introduced.\r\nThe programme started last year and about 250,000\r\nnets are now being sold in various clinics across the\r\ncountry. It is expected that by 2008, over 75 per\r\ncent of the vulnerable population will have access\r\nto long-lasting mosquito nets.\r\nAs the cost of treating malaria escalates due to the\r\nhigh cost of effective drugs, malaria prevention is\r\nbeing seen as the way forward for resource-poor\r\ncountries. Economists, including three Nobel Prize\r\nwinners, have determined that malaria prevention\r\nis one of four \ufffdvery good\ufffd uses of public funds, with\r\nbenefits exceeding costs by a factor of ten or me."}
