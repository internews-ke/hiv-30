No club\r\nis willing to take me in and I have to\r\nsurvive. The government should assist\r\nus go to Qatar,\r\nBahrain\r\nor any\r\no t h e r\r\ncountry.\ufffd\r\nI f\r\nKimuta\r\ni ,\r\nf r o m\r\nEldama\r\nRavine, is\r\nlucky, his\r\nrequest will\r\nreach the right\r\npeople \ufffd a cartel\r\nof middlemen with\r\nthe right connections\r\nin Kenya and Doha\r\nwhich is behind the lucrative\r\ntrafficking of athletes\r\nto Gulf states.\r\nWithin six months, Kigen\r\nwill have a new name, like\r\nmany in his peer group who are\r\nquietly changing citizenship, bypassing\r\nAthletics Kenya and the\r\nlaid out guidelines that spell out\r\nwhat is required of an athlete before\r\nhe or she can change nationality and\r\nrepresent an adopted country in international\r\ncompetition.\r\nHis name, in the immigration files,\r\nwill become just another statistic since\r\nhis Kenyan passport will only be used to\r\nenable him travel to Doha where he will\r\nbe issued with a brand new passport that\r\nwill even state that he was born in the\r\nGulf.\r\nBut as a safety measure, the clever\r\nathletes are not surrendering their Kenyan\r\npassports just yet or severing links\r\nwith their homeland although they are\r\nnot encouraged to invest heavily at\r\nhome.\r\nLife in athletics\ufffd Garden of Eden in\r\nthe oil-rich Qatar, with its unfavourable\r\nweather conditions and terrain, can also\r\nbe tumultuous, as one Richard Yatich\r\nfound out.\r\nNow going by the name Mubarak\r\nShami, Yatich briefly fell out with the\r\nKenyan cartel that deals with the export\r\nof athletics talent. They did not want\r\nhim to compete in weekend crosscountry\r\nmeetings leading to the Kenyan\r\nnational championships-cum IAAF\r\nCross Challenge meeting where his\r\ncover could have been blown.\r\nYatich, or Shami for that matter, had\r\nwon two weekend meetings, beaten\r\nworld marathon record holder Paul Tergat\r\nat an international 15-kilometre\r\nroad race in Holland and was\r\ndetermined to continue with competition\r\nin Kenya to maintain his form.\r\nOn November 7 last year, Yatich won\r\nthe season opening weekend meeting at\r\nTelkom Club on Nairobi\ufffds Ngong Road,\r\nprompting a foreman from Qatar to\r\nmake a quick phone call to relay the\r\nnews \ufffdhome.\ufffd\r\nSuddenly, there was keen interest in\r\nthis rising star.\r\nFour weeks later, Yatich\r\nrepeated his winning\r\nfeat in Nyahururu and\r\nconcluded the year with\r\nvictory in the Baringo half\r\nmarathon. As a Qatari.\r\nEyebrows were being\r\nraised.\r\nWhy was he continuing\r\nto feature in local events\r\nas a Qatari and how did\r\nhe acquire the Gulf\r\nnation\ufffds citizenship in the first place\r\nwithout Athletics Kenya being\r\ninvolved?\r\nYatich, we are told, had decided to\r\ncompete in Kenyan races despite advice\r\nagainst this from his new paymasters in\r\nDoha, the Qatari capital.\r\nAnd as a deterrent, his new Qatari\r\npassport was taken away by the powerful\r\ncartel and the Qatari athlete was\r\nwarned of dire consequences should\r\nhe continue competing in Kenyan\r\nevents.\r\nBut, to cover up, Yatich\r\nclaimed that one of the reasons\r\nhis passport was\r\nwithdrawn was because\r\nhe had overshot his\r\nhotel bill while in\r\nDoha where he stayed\r\nfor six months early\r\nlast year when his\r\nc i t i -\r\nz e n -\r\nship was\r\nb e i n g\r\nprocessed.\r\nBut at the hotel, Yatich did very\r\nlittle.\r\nDoctors would come, take his blood\r\nsamples and return another day. They\r\nwanted to make sure that he was fit and\r\nhealthy enough to become a Qatari.\r\nQatar has one of the highest life\r\nexpectancy rates of 73 years and one of\r\nthe lowest Aids prevalence rates of 0.09\r\npercent. That is, in a population of\r\n863,051 people 776 have been diagnosed\r\nas HIV positive, according to the CIA\r\nFactbook.\r\nTo call off the bluff, Yatich who still\r\nholds his Kenyan passport, threatened\r\nto go public.\r\nMatters became pretty hot, prompting\r\na Kenyan fixer to talk him out of what\r\nwould have been a damaging thought.\r\nWhether or not he was promised that\r\nhe would compete at the world\r\ncross-country championships in France\r\nlast March as a Qatari could not be\r\nascertained.\r\nHowever, on March 15, when the\r\nKenya team was departing to Saint\r\nEtienne for the championships, Yatich\r\nwas given back his passport and reportedly\r\nmollified with a cash compensation\r\non top of a free ticket to France.\r\nHis minders, led by Italian Canota\r\nCanova who coaches athletes from\r\nQatar and Bahrain, had other plans for\r\nhim in a long term strategy to dominate\r\nall athletics events in the world.\r\nLike other Ethiopian and Kenyan\r\nroad racers that were being\r\nrecruited, Yatich had been\r\nearmarked for marathon\r\nrunning.\r\nOn May 19, Yatich\r\nproved his worth by winning\r\nthe Vienna Marathon\r\nand possibly a place in the\r\nQatar team for the Helsinki\r\nworld championships this\r\nAugust.\r\nYatich is no longer the\r\npauper he was in his home\r\narea of Eldama Ravine and\r\nhe has involved his friends\r\nwho, though still Kenyans,\r\nare working for the Qatar\r\nteam at its training camp in\r\nIten, just\r\noutside\r\nEldoret.\r\nT h e s e\r\ni n c l u d e\r\nJoseph Cheromei,\r\nbrother of\r\nLydia Cheromei,\r\na former world\r\nc r o s s -
