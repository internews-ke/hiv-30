{"text": "Thursday, June 23, 2005\r\nWe didn\ufffdt sin, say HIV clerics\r\nInfected church leaders say anybody can contract Aids-causing virus\r\n\r\nBy TONY KAGO\r\nWe did not sin to be infected with HIV,\r\nchurch leaders who have gone public on\r\ntheir health status said yesterday.\r\nThey said that, contrary to the belief\r\nthat Aids is a sinners\ufffd disease, anybody\r\ncan contract it.\r\n\ufffdThere is no holy HIV; anybody can\r\nget HIV,\ufffd said Fr Jape Heath, the chairman\r\nof the African Network of Religious\r\nLeaders Living with or Personally\r\nAffected by HIV/Aids (Anerela). \ufffdIt\ufffds a\r\nmedical condition, not a moral issue.\ufffd\r\nThe South African priest is among\r\nchurch leaders who disclosed their status\r\nat a forum organised by the Kenya\r\nAnerela chapter at a\r\nNairobi hotel on\r\nTuesday.\r\nTaveta Anglican\r\nvicar Gibson Mwanganyi\r\nMwadime said he\r\nwas infected through\r\ncontaminated blood,\r\nbut Fr Heath, Canon\r\nGideon Byamugisha of Uganda and\r\nTanzania\ufffds Amin Sandewa said they did\r\nnot know when and how it happened.\r\nThe Rev Mwadime said revealing his\r\nstatus to his family and then the public\r\nwas the greatest thing he had done in his\r\nlife.\r\nThe father of teenagers Emily and\r\nDerrick described the pain of losing his\r\nthird-born to Aids in 1988.\r\nHe said he had been living with the\r\nvirus that causes Aids for more than 20\r\nyears, and that he was infected by his\r\nwife soon after she underwent blood\r\ntransfusion during an operation.\r\nSaid Canon Byamugisha, who said he\r\nhad been living with HIV for 18 years:\r\n\ufffdI do not know how and where I got to\r\nbe infected. All I know is that I knew I\r\nwas infected after being tested.\ufffd\r\nProdded further, he waxed philosophical:\r\n\ufffdThe only person who can be sure\r\nof how he or she was infected is the one\r\nwho has never been injected, fed on\r\nbreast milk or had unprotected and frequent\r\nsex with an infected person.\ufffd\r\n\ufffdAnd even then,\ufffd he went on, \ufffdit matters\r\nthe amount of the virus in the body,\r\nthe presence of sores or cuts on the body\r\nand the stage of infection.\ufffd\r\nSaid Fr Heath, who declined to be\r\ndrawn into discussing how he contracted\r\nthe virus: \ufffdThe real issue is not how I got\r\ninfected, but how I am living with HIV.\ufffd\r\nHe said many clergymen had declined\r\nto speak out because society believes that\r\nonly promiscuous people get infected.\r\n\ufffdLiving with HIV can be very lonely for\r\nany religious leader in all but the most\r\nloving religious communities,\ufffd\r\nhe said.\r\nMany religious leaders,\r\nhe said, lived in\r\nfear of being misunderstood,\r\nmisjudged,\r\nisolated and discriminated\r\nagainst. Pastor\r\nSandewa said most\r\nfaithful attached immorality to the disease\r\nand viewed him negatively and with\r\na lot of suspicion. \ufffdBut regardless of\r\nwhether I got it (HIV) through immorality\r\nor not, the most important thing for\r\nme right now is to live a positive and fulfilling\r\nlife.\ufffd\r\nHe said he had been discriminated\r\nagainst by his church since he was\r\ninfected in 1999.\r\nKenya Anerela chairperson Anisia\r\nKaranja said 24 HIV-positive church\r\nleaders from all faiths had joined the\r\norganisation since it was formed early\r\nlast year.\r\nMrs Karanja, a member of the Christian\r\nInternational Church, said among\r\nthem are four Catholic priests and a similar\r\nnumber of senior Muslim leaders.\r\nMrs Kauthar Bitok, a Muslim youth\r\nleader and civil servant, blamed her religion\r\nfor the spread of the disease."}
