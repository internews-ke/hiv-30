Now there are fears that\r\nthe number is much higher.\r\nDetails of the new class of drugs indicate\r\nthat they will offer a much less\r\nfrequent dose \ufffd once a week or once\r\nin a day for very severe cases. \ufffdWhen\r\napprovals are given, we plan to move\r\nfast and explore the possibility of\r\nimporting the drugs to Africa, though\r\nwe suspect serious cost implications,\ufffd\r\nsaid Dr Joseph.\r\nDisable the virus\r\nThe two completely new ARV classes\r\nin development are integrase inhibitors\r\nand maturation inhibitors. Integrase\r\ninhibitors target and disable the virus\ufffd\r\nenzyme, which plays a key role in replication,\r\nwhile maturation inhibitors\r\ninterfere with the final stages of HIV\r\nreplication.\r\nThese drugs would prevent the virus\r\nfrom assembling properly, from forming\r\na protective outer coat, or from\r\nemerging \ufffd also known as budding \ufffd\r\nfrom human cells.\r\nThe world depends on what is called\r\nHighly Active Anti Retroviral Therapy,\r\nor HAART, which is a combination of\r\nthree or more antiretroviral drugs. But\r\nsome patients have developed resistance\r\nto all three existing classes of\r\ndrugs."}
