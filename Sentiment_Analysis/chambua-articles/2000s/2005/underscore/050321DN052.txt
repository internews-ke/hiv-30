{"text": "DAILY NATION 21 MARCH, 2005\r\n\r\n\ufffdOnly draconian\r\nlaws can curtail\r\nspread of Aids\ufffd\r\nAids is no longer a matter of figures and statistics. Today, we are\r\nall counting the number of loved ones lost to the disease, or the ones we are\r\nnursing owing to it. Maybe, even we ourselves are infected. We have all\r\nseen the ugly face of Aids up close.\r\nNow that the paramount function of the law is to protect society from\r\ninternal and external threats, is Kenya doing enough to contain the Aids\r\nscourge?\r\nWell over two decades after the advent of HIV-Aids, it is undoubtedly the\r\nbiggest threat facing our nation today. But our laws remain disturbingly\r\naloof to this grave menace to society.\r\nThe HIV and Aids Prevention and Control Bill, 2003 (aka the Rachier\r\nBill), which will be the first specific legislation, is yet to pass through the\r\naugust House.\r\nA report released by UNAids earlier this month says funding will not tame\r\nAids but bold measures will.\r\nWe have all heard cases of people who, when they discover they are\r\ninfected with the deadly virus, go on a frantic sex spree to infect others.\r\nThere is no reason why a person who commits this heinous act should not\r\nbe held responsible for the death of unsuspecting victims. But, in law, such a\r\nperson would not be found guilty of murder, attempted murder or even\r\nmanslaughter.\r\nSection 186 of the Penal Code (Cap 63, Laws of Kenya), provides that \ufffdany\r\nperson who unlawfully or negligently does any act which is, and which he\r\nknows or has reason to believe to be, likely to spread the infection of any\r\ndisease dangerous to life, is guilty of a misdemeanour.\ufffd\r\nThis provision, which dates back to colonial days, no doubt had in mind less\r\ndeadly diseases like gonorrhoea, measles and scabies. Compared to Aids,\r\nthey are minor irritations.\r\nThe Rachier Bill on Aids, whose preamble states its objective as, \ufffdto\r\nprovide measures for the prevention, management and control of HIV and\r\nAids; to provide for protection and promotion of public health..., and for\r\nconnected purposes,\ufffd lacks bold provisions to combat Aids. It, therefore,\r\nmight not make much of a difference.\r\nThe most significant legislation in relation to Aids is the Public Health Act\r\n(Cap 242, Laws of Kenya). However, despite the objective of this law, as\r\ncaptured by its preamble: \ufffdto make provision for securing and maintaining\r\nhealth,\ufffd it contains no specific provision on Aids.\r\nIn fact, in the entire 209 pages of the Substantive and Subsidiary\r\nLegislation, not a single mention of HIV/Aids is made.\r\nThis is despite the fact that the Act was amended and revised recently.\r\nThe provisions of this Act could easily be construed to\r\napply to any disease affecting man and beast alike\r\nNonetheless, this Act does, by necessary implication, apply to Aids. In fact,\r\ngiven their broad spectrum, the provisions of this Act could easily be\r\nconstrued to apply to any disease affecting man and beast alike.\r\nQuite regrettably, however, the regime of the Public Health Act, despite its\r\nextensive provisions, has not been put to any meaningful use in the fight\r\nagainst Aids. Perhaps if we had taken advantage of the provisions of this\r\nAct we would be talking a different story today.\r\nAs for the bold measures necessary to curb the spread of Aids, first and\r\nforemost, intentional spread of HIV ought to be specifically proscribed by\r\nour Penal Code and upgraded to the status of a felony. The offence should\r\nbe made punishable by at least life imprisonment or even death.\r\nSecondly, as a follow up to the already existing system of Voluntary\r\nCounselling and Testing (VCT), we need to introduce a system of\r\ncompulsory testing whereby everyone would submit to a compulsory\r\nannual HIV test carried out by the Ministry of Health.\r\nA register containing the HIV status of all individuals would then be kept\r\nat all government hospitals and made available for public inspection.\r\nCertificates may also be issued to all persons tested showing their HIV\r\nstatus.\r\nThis way, not only would it be relatively easy to ascertain the status of every\r\nindividual but it would also enable us to fully appreciate the extent of the\r\nproblem. We then would be able to put it into proper perspective. Knowing\r\nwhat exactly we are dealing with will enable us to equip ourselves\r\naccordingly.\r\nMoreover, knowledge of one\ufffds HIV status allows a person the benefit of\r\nearly treatment, if infected. And if negative, the resolve to be more careful,\r\nhence reducing Aids mortality rates and curbing spread of the disease.\r\nIn the above programme, any person who fails to present himself for testing\r\nwould be liable to a penalty. In addition, the register would show that the\r\nHIV status of the person is unknown.\r\nAll these measure could be carried out within the regime of the Public\r\nHealth Act as it currently stands. Nor would this exercise be\r\nunconstitutional, for it would be in the interest of public health and safety.\r\nDraconian as these measures sound, they might just be the bitter pill that\r\nwill cure our society of this pestilence. Experience has shown that countries\r\nthat have used their laws to prevent the spread of Aids have achieved very\r\ngood results.\r\nHigher HIV infection rates have been reported in Russia, India and Cuba\r\nafter they relaxed their systems of compulsory testing.\r\nAids is a matter of life and death. The disease should be fought by all\r\nmeans necessary.\r\nIt\ufffds about time the law took its rightful place in the fight against this disease.\r\nWriter Saitabao ole Kanchory is the executive director, Centre for\r\nJuridical Research \ufffd saitabao@mail.lawguru."}
