{"text": "Daily Nation / Friday, December 9, 2005\r\nGender Based Violence Effect on Women\ufffds Participation in the Economy\r\n\r\nWomen in Kenya remain a marginalized\r\nportion of the population despite their\r\nnumerical strength, a situation, which is\r\nreinforced by existing laws and policies, as well as\r\nsocial-cultural factors. This state of affairs has led to a\r\nsituation of gross gender based inequity and\r\ninequalities. Despite the fact that women in Kenya\r\nmake up 50.5% of the population, they tend to be underrepresented\r\nin all development sectors. Persistent and\r\npervasive gender inequalities hinder access to and\r\ncontrol of resources while perpetuating unequal\r\ndistribution of resources with great bias to women. This\r\nin effect contributes to social insecurity, lack of\r\nopportunity and instills a deep sense of powerlessness,\r\nlowering quality life for both men and women.\r\nOne of the issues identified as a factor hindering such\r\nparticipation is violence against women. Violence\r\nagainst women is an obstacle to the achievement of the\r\nobjectives of equality, development and peace.\r\nViolence against women both violates and impairs or\r\nnullifies the enjoyment by women of their human rights\r\nand fundamental freedoms.\r\nThe United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of\r\nViolence Against Women defines gender-based\r\nviolence as 'a form of discrimination that seriously\r\ninhibits women's ability to enjoy rights and freedoms on\r\na basis of equality with men'. It is directed against a\r\nwoman because she is a woman and includes any act\r\nthat results in or is likely to result in physical, sexual, or\r\npsychological harm or suffering to women, including\r\nthreats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of\r\nliberty, whether occurring in public or private life. This\r\ncan be in terms of rape, sexual harassment, indecent\r\nassault, family or domestic violence, defilement, female\r\ngenital cutting, institutionalized violence such as police\r\nbrutality on female offenders, wife inheritance,\r\nfemicide, murder, forced marriages and mistreatment of\r\nthe less fortunate members of the society such as\r\nprostitutes, house girls and female refugees.\r\nWomen in Kenya experience these forms of violence\r\nin there everyday lives. Unfortunately, violence against\r\nwomen in Kenya has elicited little or no response from\r\nsociety and or government and has had been dealt with\r\nas a predominantly \ufffdwomen issue\ufffd. Yet violence against\r\nwomen and girls is a global epidemic that affects the\r\nhealth and economic stability of women, their families,\r\nand their communities.\r\nVictims of violence are often unable or afraid to seek\r\nhealth care, and the violence in their lives often\r\nprevents them from participating in the social and\r\neconomic life of their communities. Recent statistics\r\nhave shown that women who have been victims of\r\nviolence are twice as likely as women who were not\r\nvictims of violence to have poor health and physical\r\nand mental health problems, even if the violence\r\noccurred many years ago.\r\nResearch has consistently shown that violence against\r\nwomen has serious consequences on maternal mortality\r\nand child survival. Women battered during pregnancy\r\nrisk losing there lives and that of the unborn child or are\r\nlikely to deliver children with physical, mental or\r\npsychological complications.\r\nEmerging studies show a strong relationship between\r\ndomestic violence and the spread of HIV/AIDS in the\r\ndeveloping world. The combination of violence and\r\npoverty forces many women to remain in violent and\r\ndangerous relationships where they are often subjected\r\nto rape and HIV infection by their HIV-positive\r\npartners. Gender based violence also affects educational\r\nattainment and imposes obstacles to the full\r\nparticipation of women in social, economic and\r\npolitical life.\r\nAlthough gender-based violence affects women of all\r\nclasses, poverty and lack of education are additional\r\nrisk factors. Increasing levels of education can help\r\nprevent violence by empowering young women.\r\nResearch has also indicated that women who are\r\neconomically independent are less susceptible to\r\nviolence.\r\nOver the past 10 years, governments across the globe\r\nhave sought a solution to end violence against women\r\nand ensure that women are put at the forefront of each\r\nnations development agenda. Of significant importance\r\nis the Beijing Platform for Action that was adopted in\r\nBeijing, China at the Fourth World Conference on\r\nWomen in 1995 and the United Nations Millennium\r\nDeclaration that was adopted in September 2000 at\r\nUnited Nations Millennium Summit by 191 Member\r\nstates of the United Nations.\r\nThe Beijing Platform for Action is an Agenda for\r\nWomen\ufffds empowerment and aims at advancing the\r\nrights of women and at removing all obstacles in the\r\npublic and private spheres through a full and equal\r\nshare in economic, social, cultural and political\r\ndecision-making. It embodies the commitment of the\r\ninternational community to the advancement and\r\nempowerment of women and to gender equality. The\r\nPlatform for Action sets out measures for national,\r\nregional and international action in twelve critical areas\r\nof concern: women and poverty; women in education\r\nand training; women and health; violence against\r\nwomen; women in armed conflict; women and the\r\neconomy; women in power and decision-making;\r\ninstitutional mechanisms; human rights; media;\r\nenvironment, and the girl child.\r\nThe UN Millennium Declaration represents a global\r\npolitical commitment towards the promotion of\r\nsustainable human development, peace and security,\r\nhuman rights, democracy and good governance. The\r\nDeclaration sets out 8 UN Millennium Development\r\nGoals (MDGs) as a road map to implementing the\r\nDeclaration namely; Eradicate extreme poverty and\r\nhunger; Achieve universal primary education; Promote\r\ngender equality and empower women; Reduce child\r\nmortality; Improve maternal health; Combat\r\nHIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases; Ensure\r\nenvironmental sustainability and Develop a global\r\npartnership for development. In order to measure and\r\nmonitor progress, mobilize political commitment and\r\ninitiate concrete action, 16 global targets and 48 global\r\nindicators were established.\r\nGoal 3 of the MDGs calls for gender equality and\r\nempowerment as effective ways to combat poverty,\r\nhunger and disease and to stimulate development that is\r\ntruly sustainable. Gender equality and the\r\nempowerment of women are therefore considered to be\r\nboth objectives in themselves and means to achieve\r\noverall progress in development. The target associated\r\nwith MDG 3 has a narrow focus, aiming at the\r\nelimination of gender disparity in primary and\r\nsecondary education preferably by 2005, and at all\r\nlevels by 2015. The four indicators in turn focus on the\r\nratio of girls to boys in primary, secondary and tertiary\r\neducation; the ratio of literate females to males of 15-\r\nto-24-year-olds; the share of women in wage\r\nemployment in the non-agricultural sector; and the\r\nproportion of seats held by women in national\r\nparliaments. These and most of the targets and\r\nindicators established for the other MDGs, are\r\naddressed in specific objectives under different critical\r\nareas of concern in the Platform for Action.\r\nGender-based violence exacts enormous costs to the\r\ncountry\ufffds economy, to women\ufffds health, and to women\ufffds\r\nrights and directly jeopardizes the achievement of the\r\nall the MDGs. Gender-based violence directly\r\njeopardizes the achievement of MDGs related to gender\r\nequality and empowerment of women, infant mortality,\r\nmaternal health and mortality and combating\r\nHIV/AIDS. Under the Platform for Action violence\r\nagainst women\ufffds jeopardizes realization of the 12\r\ncritical areas of concern.\r\nGender disparities continue to exist in land ownership\r\nsystems. Kenya being an agricultural economy land is\r\nthe primary asset and resource for both men and\r\nwomen, yet it is men who largely own and control it. In\r\nfact land is the key collateral for credit, without which\r\nbank loans cannot be sourced. Inability to access credit\r\nsimply aggravates women\ufffds poverty situation. This\r\nsituation makes women entirely dependent on men.\r\nMany women are therefore forced to remain in abusive\r\nrelationships due to there economic dependency and\r\ninability to own assets.\r\nHIV/AIDS infections over the last five years show\r\nmore women being infected than men. Women\ufffds lives\r\nare at a greater risk of contracting HIV/AIDS. Women\r\nare not in a position to negotiate safe sex and are\r\nexposed to violence from all spheres. Recent research\r\nfindings placed women at 24% of contracting\r\nHIV/AIDS. This, the National policy on AIDS has said\r\nis not a health problem but a development concern that\r\nthreatens the very fabric of society.\r\nAlthough no single intervention will eliminate\r\nviolence against women, a combination of\r\ninfrastructural, legal, judicial, enforcement,\r\neducational, health and other service-related actions can\r\nsignificantly reduce it and its consequences. For that to\r\nhappen, however, violence against women must be\r\nviewed as unacceptable violence against women is still\r\nrelatively invisible because it typically occurs with\r\nhouseholds walls. Furthermore, many people view it as\r\na routine and even acceptable feature of relationships\r\nbetween men and women.\r\nYoung girls are at risk of violence at school due to\r\ninsecurity while walking to school or from teachers\r\nmaking the school environment unsafe for girls. This in\r\nturn affects enrollment in schools by girls for fear that\r\nthey will be abused. In higher levels of leaning young\r\ngirls experience violence in the of sexual favour for\r\ngood grades!!\r\nViolence against women exacts enormous indirect\r\ncosts. These costs, while hard to measure, inevitably\r\nhave a profound impact on the economy because of\r\nwomen\ufffds lower productivity and diminished quality of\r\nlife. The violence affects the economy by reducing\r\nwomen\ufffds labor market participation and productivity\r\nresulting in lowering earnings, savings and investment.\r\nViolence also erodes personal relationships and quality\r\nof life, both for victims and children who witness\r\nviolence. Abused women often are socially isolated,\r\npreventing them from participating in community and\r\nincome-earning activities, and perhaps most important\r\nrobbing them of the social interaction that might help\r\nend the abuse. Moreover, children tend to imitate\r\nviolent behavior that they see or experience,\r\nperpetuating the cycle from one generation to the next.\r\nTo effectively deal with gender-based violence in\r\nKenya the government needs to enact laws protecting\r\nwomen and punishing perpetrators of violence. This\r\nwill go a long way to reduce poverty status in the\r\ncountry and stimulate development that is truly\r\nsustainable. There is therefore urgent need to address\r\ngender-based violence not only as an issue affecting\r\nwomen but as a development concern. Unless and until\r\ngender- based violence is addressed sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Kenya remains elusive more so the\r\nachievement of the MDGs and the realization of the\r\nPlatform for Action."}
