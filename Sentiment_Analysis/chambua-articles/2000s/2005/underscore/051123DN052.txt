{"text": "Wednesday, November 23, 2005\r\nUN praises Kenya\ufffds Aids fight\r\nCountry gets pat on the back for reducing HIV infection rate to 7 p.c.\r\nBy KEVIN J KELLEY,\r\n\r\nNATION Correspondent,\r\nNEW YORK\r\nKenya\ufffds historic gains in the fight\r\nagainst Aids were touted on Monday as\r\namong the few encouraging points in a\r\nbleak United Nations report on the global\r\npandemic.\r\nThe country\ufffds success in rolling back\r\nits HIV infection rate from 10 per cent\r\nto seven per cent of adults marks \ufffdonly\r\nthe second time in more than two decades\r\nthat a sustained decline in national\r\nHIV infection levels has been seen in a\r\nsub-Saharan African country,\ufffd\r\nthe UNAids agency\r\nsays in its 2005 update on\r\nthe epidemic.\r\nKenya has now matched\r\nthe achievement of\r\nUganda \ufffd the country\r\ncited as the most effective\r\nin the developing world in\r\ncontrolling the spread of Aids.\r\nThe drop in HIV prevalence in Kenya\r\nhas been most dramatic among pregnant\r\nwomen in urban areas, according to\r\nUNAids.\r\nGains have been particularly impressive\r\nin Busia, Meru, Nakuru and Thika,\r\nwhere median HIV prevalence plummeted\r\nfrom approximately 28 per cent\r\nin 1999 to nine per cent in 2003.\r\nThe UNAids report attributes the\r\noverall turnaround in Kenya partly to\r\nbehavioural changes.\r\nCondom use with casual partners has\r\nincreased, most strikingly, among women,\r\nthe UN agency says.\r\nIn 2003, almost 24 per cent of Kenyan\r\nwomen surveyed said they had used a\r\ncondom the last time they had casual\r\nsex, compared with 15 per cent five\r\nyears earlier.\r\nIn addition, the proportions of men\r\nand women with more than one sexual\r\npartner were reduced more than half\r\nduring the decade ending in 2003.\r\nMore young Kenyans are also delaying\r\nsexual debut, says UNAids.\r\n\ufffdAll this is occurring against the backdrop\r\nof expanded HIV information campaigns,\r\nvoluntary counselling and testing\r\nprogrammes and gradually improving\r\naccess to anti-retroviral therapy,\ufffd the\r\nreport observes.\r\nThe large number of Kenyans who\r\nhave died from Aids-related diseases has\r\nalso contributed to the\r\nreduced prevalence of\r\nH I V i n f e c t i o n s ,\r\nUNAids points out.\r\nDeath rates from\r\nAids in Kenya may be\r\nhigher than the rates at\r\nwhich new infections\r\nare occurring, the\r\nreport suggests.\r\nBut the news in the UN report is not\r\nall good for Kenya.\r\nHIV infections are still alarmingly\r\ncommon in Chulaimbo (14 per cent of\r\nadults), Busia (16 per cent) and Suba (30\r\nper cent), says the report.\r\nKenya\ufffds achievement in generally\r\nslowing the epidemic is especially noteworthy\r\nin the context of black Africa \ufffd\r\nhome to more than 60 per cent of the 40\r\nmillion people worldwide with HIV.\r\nBlack Africans will also account for\r\nthree-quarters of the 3.1 million Aidsrelated\r\ndeaths in the world this year.\r\nGlobally, the number of HIV-infected\r\npersons has doubled in the past decade,\r\naccording to UNAids."}
