{"text": "The Daily Nation\r\nThursday, May 5, 2005\r\nThe poor\ufffds appeal to the G8\r\nHelp end poverty for war on Aids to\r\nsucceed, slum dwellers tell the rich\r\n\r\nBy LUCAS BARASA\r\nThe rich nations were yesterday told to\r\nhelp end poverty in the world for the\r\nfight against Aids to succeed.\r\nResidents of Nairobi\ufffds Kibera, which\r\nis regarded as Africa\ufffds biggest slum and\r\nwhere most of the city\ufffds poor live, told a\r\nteam travelling on bus collecting views\r\non poverty from around Africa, that the\r\neradication of the epidemic would be a\r\npipe dream if poverty persisted.\r\nThe bus started its journey in South\r\nAfrica on March 31\r\nand arrived in Kenya\r\non May 1. The views\r\nbeing collected on poverty,\r\ndebt, HIV/Aids\r\nand trade will be forwarded\r\nto a meeting of\r\nthe world\ufffds most industrialised\r\ncountries\r\n(G8), in Scotland on July 6.\r\nMs Rebecca Wabwoba, an Action-\r\nAid International official, said the vehicle\r\nwill be in Nakuru today on its way\r\nto Eldoret and Busia \ufffd and on to\r\nUganda. ActionAid has organised the\r\ntour as part of the Global Action\r\nAgainst Poverty campaign.\r\nTanzania, Malawi and Mozambique\r\nare some of the countries the bus has\r\nvisited.\r\n\ufffdThe issues raised will be analysed, a\r\nreport produced and a video copy presented\r\nto the G8 leaders,\ufffd said the\r\nActionAid official in charge of the\r\nHIV/Aids programme in Africa, Mr\r\nLeonard Okello.\r\nYesterday, the slum dwellers regretted\r\nthat, unlike in rich countries where\r\npeople living with the disease live longer,\r\nin Kenya most patients die early due\r\nto lack of basic needs and access to lifeprolonging\r\ndrugs.\r\n\ufffdIf we could get better food, clean\r\nwater and better healthcare and our\r\neconomy improved we would be able to\r\nreduce stress and trauma that hasten our\r\ndeath once we catch Aids,\ufffd Mr Enock\r\nOyier said.\r\nTwenty-nine-year-old Emily Anyona,\r\nwho said she had been living with HIV\r\nfor years, named treatment as key\r\namong the things she wanted to get from\r\nthe G8.\r\n\ufffdYes, I have heard of countries like\r\nAmerica. They should help us get treatment.\r\nThe poor living conditions\r\nwe are in only\r\nworsens our sickness,\ufffd she\r\nsaid when a member of the\r\nteam asked her if she was\r\naware of the G8.\r\nThe residents, most of\r\nthem unemployed, casual\r\nlabourers and hawkers,\r\nsaid their monthly incomes were less\r\nthan Sh1,000, and that rent consumed\r\nSh600, leaving them with too little to\r\nraise the Sh500 needed monthly for the\r\nanti-retrovirals (cheap drugs).\r\n\ufffdOur landlords are rich men and they\r\nrarely come here. They only use agents\r\nto collect rent. We have no toilet facilities\r\nand rely on what you call flying toilets;\r\nwe lack clean water supply, the\r\ndrainage system is poor and sanitation\r\npathetic,\ufffd Mr Alfred Sichangi said.\r\nAlthough they want donors to cancel\r\nKenya\ufffds debts, the Government should\r\nshow commitment to eradicating poverty\r\nand properly use the available\r\nresources, they said.\r\nBetter housing, food and water supply,\r\nmore jobs and the improvement of\r\nthe infrastructure such as roads are some\r\nof the issues they said should be given\r\npriority."}
