Feted activist criticises
Uganda’s policy on Aids

KAMPALA, Saturday
A Ugandan honoured by an
international human rights group
for her campaign to help fellow
HIV-positive women, said her
country’s Aids policy had become
misguided and moralistic.
“Political leaders, religious people
have been (campaigning
against) the use of condoms, moralising
the issue of Aids as if it
was a moral dialogue, yet it’s a
health issue, Beatrice Were told
the Associated Press on Thursday
after Human Rights Watch
announced she was among this
year’s recipients of its Human
Rights Defender Award.
“It is disheartening to see people
undoing what we have worked
so hard to achieve, she said of the
fight against Aids and HIV, the
virus that causes it, in Uganda.
“But because people out there in
the international community are
recognising our work, this has
rekindled my commitment to
fight.”
Uganda was once hailed as a
model for Africa for its approach
to fighting Aids, with an aggressive
campaign led by political,
religious and community leaders
credited with lowering infection
rates from over 20 per cent in the
early 1990s to the current 6 per
cent.
But experts fear those gains
could be lost because of what they
see as an increasing emphasis on
abstinence, encouraged in part by
the stance of the US, a major
donor.
The government responds that
encouraging abstinence is just part
of its broad campaign against
Aids. — AP
