is among humans or its longterm
effects.
So far, only about 40 people
are known to carry the virus,
including African bushmeat
hunters and zoo and lab workers
in North America.
The authors suspect many
more people have been
infected in Asia where
humans and primates come in
close contact. Some 700,000
tourists visit four monkey
temples just in Bali each year.
Of those, an estimated 35,000
visitors are bitten, according
to the study in last month’s
Emerging Infectious Diseases,
a journal of the US Centres
for Disease Control and Prevention.
“We’re talking about a significant
number of people, and
we’re talking about people
who then leave the next day
and travel ... around the
world,” said Gregory Engel,
co-author of the study.
The authors say people who
have been bitten or scratched
by monkeys should not
become alarmed, especially
since there is no easy way to
test for the virus in humans.
However, scientists question
how SFV could react when
mixed with HIV, tuberculosis
or other human diseases.
It’s also unclear how SFV
could behave in humans over
time. SFV is genetically different
from the virus in primates
that’s believed to have
emerged as HIV, but the
authors say there’s no guarantee
SFV won’t alter and eventually
become harmful to
humans.
The virus that causes Aids is
believed to have passed from
primates to people in Africa decades
before it began sickening
people in the 1980s. There is no
evidence SFV has been transmitted
among people.
William M. Switzer of the CDC’s
Division of HIV/Aids Prevention
said more studies are needed on
how widespread SFV is and on
the likelihood of human-tohuman
transmission of crossspecies
infections. “The public
health implications of SFV in
humans are also not fully
known,” said Switzer, who has
researched SFV but did not take
part in this study.
The researchers say SFV may
never become harmful to
humans, but could be an indicator
that other viruses may jump
more easily from monkey to man.
Asia is familiar with cross-species
infection from acute respiratory
syndrome, or SARS, which is
believed to have first jumped
from animals to people in China;
it killed nearly 800 people worldwide.
The region is now battling
avian flu in which poultry has
infected humans, killing at least
60 people since 2003.
“We’ve opened up a whole new
continent where we need to seriously
consider that there are
viruses and pathogens that can be
communicated between primates
and humans,” Engel said of the
first SFV case found in Asia.
“We’re talking about billions of
people and millions of primates
and the possibility of unknown
pathogens being out there and a
very real mechanism whereby
those pathogens can flow.”
The authors say people can still
visit monkey temples, but close
contact should be avoided. They
advise wearing pants, not taking
food inside and never coming
between a mother monkey and
her young.
