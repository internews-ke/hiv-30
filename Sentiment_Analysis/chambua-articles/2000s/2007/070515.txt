{"text": "15TH MAY 2007\r\n\r\nAFRICA TRADITIONAL HEALERS.\r\n\r\nare located in nearly every rural village setting\r\nas well as in the busy urban areas. Therefore,\r\nthey are a godsend to Africa's cash-strapped\r\nhealth ministries since they are already \"on\r\nthe ground':\r\nTraditional healers in Africa are also\r\nquite knowledgeable about HIV and Aids.\r\nFor example, urban traditional healers\r\nin Tanzania know very well about the\r\nopportunistic infections caused by HIV and\r\nAids and what herbal medicines can treat\r\nthem. They know too that a healthy diet and\r\ntreatment of sexually transmittable diseases\r\ncan greatly help in maintaining good health\r\nfor PL\\-VH.As besides keeping HN-infection\r\nat bay. Furthermore, they are also aware that\r\nhigh fevers from malaria, for instance, can\r\nweaken the body even further if one is HIVpositive.\r\nThey also tell their patients not to engage in\r\nsexual activity because it cannot only further\r\nthe spread the virus but also weaken their\r\nimmune system. Even something as simple\r\nas a massage can have great physical and\r\npsychological benefits since it both relieves\r\nPLVVHAs of excruciating pains in their\r\nlower limbs but it also gives them existential\r\nreassuran,ce since they know that few want to\r\ntouch someone with HIV and Aids.\r\nSimply dishing out ARVs is not enough.\r\nPLWHAs in Africa need appropriate\r\nsocial counselling and \"pyschic\" support\r\nand indigenous healers can provide the\r\nappropriate emotional, psychological\r\nspiritual counselling. For example, such\r\ncounselling would deal with reducing social\r\nstigmatization (something that even PLWHAs\r\nin the West continue to experience but is\r\noffered little help from \\Vestern biomedicine\r\nand socialservices.\r\nHowever, despite their knowledge and\r\npopularity, traditional healers are given a\r\nraw deal by Western medical experts. Usually\r\nthey are invited to week-long workshops\r\nor seminars where they exchange views\r\nand information \"With health educators,\r\nresearchers, nurses and doctors. However, the\r\ninformation flow is one-way-. the scientific\r\nview is promoted by the \"trainers\" \"With little\r\nreal input for these Africa specialists.\r\nTrue collaboration, however, requires a\r\nmeasure of respect for indigenous medicine\r\nand African culture generally. It also requires\r\nthe shedding of stereotypes of African\r\ntraditional healers. Most important of all, say\r\nexperts, is the search for a common ground\r\nbetween western biomedicine and traditional\r\nhealers and building upon that common\r\nground. Combining forces \"With healers to\r\ncombat HIV and Aids and promote public\r\nhealth makes good sense.\r\nAnd yet most experts who work \"With\r\ntraditional healers in sub-Saharan Africa\r\nhave found them most eager to collaborate\r\nwith Western biomedicine in public health\r\nprograms. Just the fact that they are\r\n\"omnipresent\" in most settings in Africa\r\nmakes them ideal partners in spreading\r\nimportant public health messages to larger\r\nnumbers of people\r\nWhat more' can traditional healers do in the\r\nfight against HIV and Aids? For instance, they\r\ncould be the ones to distribute the medicine\r\nand ensure that patients take the right doses.\r\nVlhiIe traditional healers will need to be\r\neducated to do this, it will be less expensive\r\nto upgrade their knowledge than to expand\r\nthe formal health system. Building on existing\r\nsystems seems to have a higher chance of\r\nsustainability.\r\nHealers could also give advice to PLWHAs\r\nabout psycho-social problems, stigma and\r\nsocial marginalisation, diet and exercise,\r\navoiding alcohol and tobacco; despair and\r\ndepression; maintaining hope and spiritual\r\noutstanding example of how positive results\r\ncan be achieved in the fight against Aids\r\nby combining local expertise, indigenous\r\nknowledge and modern health workers to\r\nprovide effective low-cost treatment for peopIe\r\nliving witb Aids.\r\nTAWG has received international\r\nrecognition of its innovative work V1Tith\r\ntraditional healers, and has got support from\r\nOxfam, the World Bank and USAID.\r\nAcross the continent in West Africa there\r\nis the Airica-wide Senegal-based NGO,\r\nPROMETRA, which is presently coordinating\r\nAids programs that involve incligenous .African\r\nhealers throughout the continent.\r\nSuch indigenous strategies for dealing vvith\r\nthe ravages ofAids have not gone unrecognised\r\nby the international community. For example,\r\nin 1998, the World Bank launched the\r\nIndigenous Knowledge for Development\r\nprogram, which, in the words of former\r\nWorld Bank President James D. Wolfensohn,\r\naimed \"to help learn from communitybased\r\nknowledge systems and development\r\npractices and to incorporate them into WE\r\nsupported programs:'\r\nThe number of Western trained\r\ndoctors in Zambia 600 of whom\r\nare foreign\r\n_._---_.... --~--------_.-.-\r\nPredates mollern medicine\r\nHowever, this had not always been the bank's\r\nposition. Traditional healers in Africa, for\r\nexample, were considered to be irrelevant\r\nto modernity and therefore to be excluded\r\nfrom development. A similar reluctance\r\nwas initially found in the World Bank were\r\ntraditional healers' practices were often\r\nperceived as lacking scientific validation,\r\nand hence legitimacy. This view was also\r\nwidespread among western doctors, although\r\ntraditional health practices predates modern\r\nmedical practice just as the use of herbs and\r\nmedicinal plants predates modern medicine.\r\nThe joint United Nations Programme\r\non HIV and Aids (UNAlDS) and the World\r\nHealth Organization have recommended\r\nthat developing countries harness the\r\npotential contribution oflocal resources and\r\nknowledge-specifically, traditional medicine\r\n(TRM) and its practitioners.\r\nUNAIDS has also published a set of\r\nguidelines aimed at empowering health\r\nauthorities, governmental and nongovernmental\r\norganisations as weB as\r\ncommunity groups seeking to develop a\r\nproductive relationship between traditional\r\nand conventional (biomedical) health\r\nsystems.\r\nfaith and not spreading the disease.
