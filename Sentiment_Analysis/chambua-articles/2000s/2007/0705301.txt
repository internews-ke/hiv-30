Bush\r\nto double US funding to fight the pandemic.\r\nMr. Bush is urging the US congress to provide $30 billion (sh2,o40 billion) for his \r\nemergency AIDS relief programme in the first five years after he leaves office in 2008. A\r\ntotal of $15 billion has been approved since the launch of the programme in 2003.\r\nThe funds help supply anti-retroviral drugs that enable more than 75,000 AIDS patients\r\nto add years to their lives.\r\nKenya is likely to qualify  for substantial amounts  of additional assistance because its version of the programme\r\nis considered successful.\r\nMr. Bush was scheduled to make his appeal in a White House Rose garden speech late Wednesday night."}
