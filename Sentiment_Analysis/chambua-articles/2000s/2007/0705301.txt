BUSH MOVES TO DOUBLE GLOBAL AIDS FUNDING

By Nation Correspondent
NEW YORK

Several thousands more Kenyans will receive
life-extending AIDS drugs as a result of 
yesterdays decision by president George W. Bush
to double US funding to fight the pandemic.
Mr. Bush is urging the US congress to provide $30 billion (sh2,o40 billion) for his 
emergency AIDS relief programme in the first five years after he leaves office in 2008. A
total of $15 billion has been approved since the launch of the programme in 2003.
The funds help supply anti-retroviral drugs that enable more than 75,000 AIDS patients
to add years to their lives.
Kenya is likely to qualify  for substantial amounts  of additional assistance because its version of the programme
is considered successful.
Mr. Bush was scheduled to make his appeal in a White House Rose garden speech late Wednesday night.
