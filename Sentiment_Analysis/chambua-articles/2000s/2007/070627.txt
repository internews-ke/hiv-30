Whatever your goa!,\r\nyou can get there, as long as you are wiiHng to be honest with yourself\r\nabout the preparation and work involved. There are no back\r\ndoors, no free rldes. There's just you, this moment, and a cholce,\"\r\nAnd Oprah's statement apdy descdbes my situat~on. For the re~\r\ncord, I don't have a secret formula for positlve living.\r\n\"Keep doing the Ijtt~e things that I've told you and the going win\r\nbe iess stressful,\" my doctor once to~d me.\r\nff these ~ittle things are I.Nhat folks think are my big secret, then\r\nit's an open one because it's the !~st of dDS and don'ts that doctors\r\nnormally give their H1V-positive clients. The list consists of things\r\nHke nutrition, exerdse, acceptance, a faithful He and l100ktng up\r\nwith a support group, Over the years i've tried to live as per my\r\ndoctor's prescriptions, a~though ~~ke every Jane out there, ! haven't\r\nadhered to this 100 per cent.\r\ni think that as Oprah reaHsed, there are no quick fixes to anything\r\nunder the sun. ~n her article, she readHy vO!U!1teers that if there\r\nwas a secret to fix for her well~documentedweight issues, for\r\nexample, she would have it because she's tried almost everything\r\nunder the sun.\r\n~'ve walked that road too, Immediately after i tested positive,\r\nI ran round in cirdes in search for something - anything - that\r\nwould zap this ugly virus out of my life. If I wasn't on the front line\r\nin a healing crusade, I was waiting in a queue on a creaky wooden\r\nbench in a quack's shack, Like most people driven by fear, ignorance\r\nand desperation, ! was convinced that there was a quiCk fix\r\nsomewhere that would make me. HIV-!ess again. Boy was i wrong?\r\nOf course, you know where dead ends always lead -I ended up\r\nbroke and nearly dead.\r\nIthink that, by permanently fixing our gaze on the flnal solution\r\nand ignoring the small steps thatwe need to take everyday,\r\nwe end up missing the whole essence of positive living. Most of us\r\nrationalise that - if we know beforehand how to handle the issues\r\nahead of us - then the roughs and tumbies ahead of us will be\r\nmere details. But that's not the reality on the ground.\r\nThe reality is that we have to live for the moment. Much as we\r\nneed to learn from each other, we must endeavour to make our\r\nown personal choices because a goal like positive living isn't a onestop\r\ndestination but a daily journey.\r\n\r\nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a mother of two who tested\r\npositive 19years ago. She ;s the executive director of the Kenya\r\nNetwork of Women with Aids (KENWA)."}
