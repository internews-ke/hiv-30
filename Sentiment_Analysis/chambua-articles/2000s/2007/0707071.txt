Marie Stopes Kenya is a non\ufffd\r\ngovernmental, not-for-:profit organization\r\naffiliated to Marie Stopes International of\r\nLondon in the United Kingdom which has\r\na presence in 42 countries in Asia, Latin\r\nAmerica, Africa, Europe and South Asia.\r\nThe Kenyan affiliate was the first\r\nproject in Africa and is a role model for\r\nothers on the continent.\r\nUpon establishment, the NGO\r\nproceeded to open the first clinic at\r\nPangani in 1986. From this hnmble\r\nbeginning, Marie Stopes Kenya, now\r\noperates 22 reproductive health facilities\r\nnationwide.\r\nThese consist of 18 clinics and four\r\nmaternity nursing homes.\r\nIt aims at achieving 650,000 couple\ufffd\r\nyears of protection (GYPs) by 2010. CYP is\r\nan indicator to measure family planning\r\nprogramme effectiveness.\r\n\r\nScope of Service and Activities\r\nMarie Stopes Kenya offers the follO'wing\r\nhigh quality and affordable services in its\r\nfacilities:\r\n\ufffd Medical Consultation.\r\ne Specialist gynecological consultations.\r\ne Comprehensive family planning\r\nservices.\r\ne OUtreach voluntary surgical\r\ncontraception.\r\ne Pre-natal and post-natal care.\r\ne Child welfare clinic.\r\n\ufffd Comprehensive laboratory services.\r\n\ufffd 24\ufffdhour maternity services.\r\n\ufffd Free condom distribution.\r\n\ufffd School health education.\r\n\ufffd PMTCT.\r\n\ufffd vcr.\r\ne Youth reproductive health services.\r\nThe condom or contraceptives social\r\nmarketing project is one of the most high\r\nprofile activities of Marie Stopes Kenya.\r\n'We pelieve that Marie Stopes is making\r\na major contribution in helping people\r\nto protect themselves from unwanted\r\npregnancies, sexually transmitted ~\r\ninfections and HN/AiDS by providing the\r\nRaha condom,\" says Mr. Cyprian Awiti,\r\nthe organization's Programmes Director.\r\nRaha means pleasure in English, 'We\r\ndon't want to associate sex with HNjAiDS\r\nand sickness,\" says Mr. Awiti. \"Sex is part\r\nof life and people should be protected\r\nfrom unpleasant outcomes. We want to\r\nprotect people as they go on with their\r\nlives.\"\r\nIn national reach, Marie Stopes is\r\nsecond to the government network,\r\naccording to the NGO's boss. 'We have\r\nmore than 50 outreach clinics, 22 static\r\nclinics, we have distributors of our\r\ncondoms - about 1,00Q and the social\r\nfranchising people who number 141,\" says\r\nMr. Awiti.\r\n\"So, when you look at the impact of\r\nMarie Stopes in condom distribution in\r\nKenya, we do 75 per cent of the market\r\nshare in the country. In fact, if you look\r\nat family planning as a whole, we could\r\nbe contributing about 40 per cent. But\r\nfor one particular contraception method\r\ncalled tubal ligation, Marie Stopes is\r\ndoing 75 per cent of the total market\r\nshare in this country.\"\r\nMarie Stopes is a major contributor\r\nto health care in the country and\r\nespecially in regard to provision of sexual\r\nand reproductive health products and\r\nservices.\r\nSays Mr. Awiti: ''We work very closely\r\nwith the provincial health management\r\nteams, Ministry of Health's Division of\r\nReproductive Health, all stakeholders\r\nincluding the National Co\ufffdordinating\r\nAgency for Population and Development\r\nand all other agencies that provide\r\nreproductive health services in the\r\ncountry. We collaborate and network:'\r\nHe says the NGOs future plans include\r\ndoing male circumcision to help protect\r\nmen from HNjAIDS infection.\r\nA study done in Kenya shows that,\r\nchances of people who are circumcised\r\nnot contacting HIVjAIDS is about 60 per\r\ncent.\r\nIn future, Marie Stopes Kenya intends\r\nto eXpand geographically to other areas\r\nlike Embu, Machakos, Siaya, Bondo,\r\nMigori~Bungoma, Busia and Kilifi.\r\nIn its strategic plan, the organization\r\nindicates that it intends to have 30 clinics\r\nin two tothree years up from the current\r\n22.\r\n\"We plan to expand everywhere\r\nincluding North Eastern Province where\r\nwe don't have a presence so far,\" says Mr.\r\nAwiti.\r\n''We also want to expand our mix of\r\nfamily planning methods and services. We\r\nare offering curative services but that is\r\nnot our core business. Our core business\r\nis providing sexual and reproductive\r\nhealth services,\" he adds.\r\nMarie Stopes Kenya is transparent,\r\naccountable and results\ufffdoriented\r\norganization that is going places, he\r\nasserts. 'We operate above board:'\r\n\r\n\r\nJOIN EFFORTS TO INCREASE ENLIGHTENMENT IN LONG TERM SAFEGUARDS\r\n\r\nMarie\ufffdStopes Kenya works with private medical\r\npractitioners to increase the upta:ke of family planning\r\nmethods and especially intra\ufffduterine contraception\r\ndevices (IUCDs and voluntary surgical sterilisation.\r\nThis is besides working closely with the Ministry of\r\nHealth.\r\nThe objective is to increase the availability of these\r\nlong term family planning methods.\r\nThe initiative has been operating in Western Kenya\r\nwhere the team has been working with and managing\r\na network offranchised private practioners.\r\nThis partnership has helped to debunk some\r\nmyths about these contraceptiye methods by making\r\ninformation on them available to people who need\r\nfamily planning services.\r\nA study carried on family planning revealed that\r\nthe uptake of IUCDs and vasectomy waS negatively\r\naffected by myths. That is why Marie Stopes decided to\r\nwork with health professionals to increase awareness\r\nofthese family planning methods and thereby\r\nincreasing the uptake.\r\nThrough respective professional aSsociations, Marie\r\nStopes approached 141 health practitioners with 0'WIl\r\nclinics and keen.onreproductive health issues. It\r\ndiscussed with doctors, nurses and clinical officers to\r\noffer reproductive health services over and above their\r\ncore focus.\r\nThe nonNgovernmental organization (NGO) then\r\ntrained and gave equipment to them so that they\r\nwere better equipped to serve people who visited\r\ntheir clinics. The training covered issues such as\r\ncontraception and updates on sexually transmitted\r\ninfections (STIs).\r\nThese clinics are painted green and have the sign\r\n:Arona' a Swahili word for 'decide;\r\nMarie Stopes, contends Marie Stopes Programme\r\nDirector Cyprian Awiti, has the largest social\r\nfranchising project in Kenya. \"The quality of service is\r\nvery good and the clients are' very happy. We believe\r\nthere are a number of Kenyans deniedthe opportunitY\r\nor do not have access to reproductive health services;'\r\nWith its 22 service delivery clinics, outreach or\r\nmobile clinics and the private practitioner facilities,\r\nthe NGO has expanded the points from which Kenyans\r\ncan <tccess reproductiv: health services.\r\n''Marie Stopes believes women should be productive,\r\nnot reproductive,\" says M:t.Awiti, warning that getting\r\nchildren too early, too often or too late comes with\r\nrisks fOrwomen. \"We are not stopping people from\r\nhaving children; we are helping them to plan families.\r\nWomen should not be made reproductive machines\r\nbut empowered through family planning.\"\r\nMen, women and youth of reproductive age need\r\nintegrated and innovative health services so that they\r\nget \"children by choice, not by chance\" as Marie Stopes\r\nInternational says of its goal.\r\nFamily planning has a number of issues at different\r\nlevels. At the family level, it is a problem having too\r\nmany children that one cannot even take care of.\r\nAt the national level, it brings too many problems\r\n- education,' employment; health':'\" the government\r\n\"budget cannot be able to sustain a high PQIJUlation\r\ngrowth rate.\r\nHe says family planning contributes to better\r\nlives and has a bearing on education, health and\r\nemployment in a nation.\r\n\"The\ufffdgovernment through the Ministry of Health\r\nhas now coine up with the'National Health Strategic\r\nPlan II which all of us working in this sector aspire\r\nto. We are not working independently. The domain\r\nof provision of health services is for the Government\r\ni of Kenya. We are complementing government efforts.\r\nSo, we must work within the realm of the government\r\npolicies and legal framework\"\r\nThe national strategic plan is being implemented\r\nthrough annual operational plans I\ufffdV. This has\r\nbrought on board the public sector, NGOs and faith\ufffd\r\nbased organizations.\r\nHe gives credit to the government for working hard\r\nto provide health services to wananchi.\r\nThe government, says :Mr. Awiti, has perlormed\r\nwell in health. Its performance so far is encouraging.\r\n''Today if you go to hospitals you will find medicines\r\nand working health facilities - which was not the\r\ncase before,\" he say~ aJ;ld is happy to notethat\r\nthe government recognizes the contribution of\r\norganizations such as Marie Stopes to improving\r\npeople's health."}
