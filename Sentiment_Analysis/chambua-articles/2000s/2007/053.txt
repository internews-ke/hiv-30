declaration ofAids
as a national disaster
marked a turning
point in war against
the disease in Kenya. The
conntry had at last woken up
to the impact of the scourge.
However, more still needs
to be done to help orphans
and their gtlatdians overcome
poverty.
The disease remains one
of the biggest catastrophes to
havehithnmankind in the last
three decades.
Sub-Saharan Africa has been
hardest hit with over 600 Aids
patients said to be dying daily.
Many countries in the region
have a prevalence rate of between
10 and 12 per cent, and
the pinch of the impact of the
disease is felt in all the sectors
ofthe countries' economies.
IiI these countries, the pandemichas
impactedheavilyon
orphans and their guardians.
With infection rates going np
and more people succumbing
to the disease, the number of
Aids orphans has been on the
rise.
'The sad reality is that the
majority ofthose who die from
the disease are young and energetic
workers who are also
the breadwinners ofthe families.
Andwhen theydie, thejob
ofproviding for the families is
left to children, some in their
teenage years.
'The disease has also impact-
ed negatively on orphans and
guardians as regards access
to education and basic needs
such as food, clothing and
shelter. It has' also subjected
them to stigma and exposed
them to the vicions cycle of
povelt)'.
Access to education will remain a mirage to most ofthese
children. Even though the
country aspires to have educationfor
all by20l5, for orphans
and vulnerable children this
might be a pipe dream.
Since most are left nnder the
care ofold andpoor goardians
struggling to make ends meet,
providing basic needs like
school unifonn and food is a
difficult task
Moreover, stigma has re-
- mained a constant companion
to orphans. Most-have to
seek refuge in childten's home
while the lucky few who get
guardians may face other life
challenges. For some, engaging
in menHU workfor upkeep
is a illilly routine
Such children end up being
exploited economically, physically,
morally and sometimes
spiritually. Although there is
legislation covering them for
example the Children's Act,
such laws are being flouted
with impunity.
