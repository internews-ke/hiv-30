{"text": "SATURDAY NATION July 7,2007\r\n\r\nPANDEMIC\r\nELIZABETH MATAKA AND ZEDA ROSENBERG\r\n\r\nEmpowering women key\r\nstep in fight against Aids\r\n\r\nMore than 1,000 leaders from \r\naround the world came together\r\nin Nairobi this week\r\ndiscuss issues related to\r\nHIV and Aids. While conferences on the\r\npandemic are rather commonplace, this\r\nmeeting was different.\r\nThis time, African women - doctors,\r\nactivists, nurses, grandmothers, community\r\nleaders, andwomenliving with HIV\r\n- took centre stage at the International\r\nWomen's Health Summit.\r\nIt makes good sense that women are\r\nleading the fight against Aids. Some 60\r\nper cent of Africans living 'With HIV are\r\nwomen. Among young people the situation\r\nis worse: More than 75 per cent of\r\n15-24-year-o!ds living with HIV in Africa\r\nare women.\r\nIn Kenya, youngwomen are five times\r\nas likely as young men to be HlVpositive.\r\nIN ZAMBIA, AiDS HAS REDUCED a\r\nwoman's average life expectancy to 37\r\nyears. Across the continent, women are\r\nstruggling to educate orphans, care for\r\nthe sick, and feed their families underthe\r\nweight of this epidemic.\r\nEncouraging people to always use condoms\r\nand be faithful to one partner is\r\nimportant, but it is not enongh. In fact,\r\nwe know that in some cases marriage,\r\nor what a woman believes is a monogamous\r\nrelationship, can actually increase\r\na woman's risk ofHN\r\nA woman may not be able to convince\r\nher partner to use condoms - or she and\r\nher partner may want to have children,\r\nwhich they cannot do while abstaining or\r\nusing condoms. And remaining faithful\r\nto her husband cannot protect a woman\r\nwhose husband is not faithful to her.\r\nTo successfully defeat Aids we must\r\ndo more to help women to protect themselves.\r\nA vaccine to prevent HIV, once developed,\r\ncould save millions oflives. Another\r\npromising tool is a microbicide, a vaginal\r\ngel, ring or tablet that women could\r\nuse to prevent infection.\r\nAdvocates in Africa\r\nMicrobicides are not yet available, but\r\nresearchers and advocates in Africa and\r\naround the world are working to develop\r\nthem and carry out clinical trials to test if\r\nthey are safe and effective in preventing\r\nHIVinfection.\r\nBy putting protection from HIV into\r\nthe hands of women, a microbicide\r\nwould slow the spread of the virus and\r\nfinally allowwomen to take control over\r\ntheir own health.\r\nWe must prioritise research on these\r\npromising preventive technologies. At\r\nthe same time, we must do more with\r\nthe tools that already exist.\r\nThe female condom should be affordable\r\nand accessible to women in Africa.\r\nWe must expand prevention of mother-\r\nto-chiId-transmission services so that\r\nevery pregnant woman receives the care\r\nand treatment she needs.\r\nLIKE NEARLYALL OF US, THE women\r\nattending this week's summit have lost\r\nfamily members, workmates, andfriends\r\nto this disease.\r\nThese women are on the frontlines\r\nevery day - the doctor working long\r\nhours in the clinic, the grandmotherwho\r\ncares for her orphaned grandchildren,\r\nthe community care worker visiting the\r\nhomes ofthe sick, thewomanlivingwith\r\nHIVwho had the courage to say so publicly,\r\nthe sexworker who spends her days\r\neducating her peers at the taxi rank.\r\nThese women are the ones who have\r\ntold us ofthe desperate need for femaleinitiated\r\nHIV prevention approaches.\r\nAfter all, their lives and the future of our\r\nfamilies and countries depend on it.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Mataka is the United Nations Secretary\r\nGeneral's Special Envoy lor Aids in\r\nAlrica.
