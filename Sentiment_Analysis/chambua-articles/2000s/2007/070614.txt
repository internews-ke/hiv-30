{"text": "DAILY NATION Thursday June 14, 2007\r\n\r\nDSW LAUNCHES\r\nYOUTH-FRIENDLY MOBILE VCT\r\n\r\nVCT ON WHEELS TO HELP YOUTH COMBAT HIV/AIDS\r\n\r\nBy EVANS ONGWAE\r\nhelp youth\r\ncombat\r\nwheels to\r\nhe country's youth now have a\r\nchance to grab the HIV/AIDS\r\nchallenge by the horns and wrestle\r\nit to the ground. Young people, the\r\nmost at risk against the HIVlArDS threat, are\r\nbeing empowered with tools with which to\r\nfight back and save their Jives.\r\nThe German Foundation for World\r\nPopulation (DSW) today launches mobile\r\nyouth-friendly voluntary counselling and\r\ntesting (VeT) services targeted at the\r\nnation's youth. The non-governmental\r\norganization will take these services right to\r\nthe young people's doorsteps in its ongoing\r\nefforts to stem the HIVjAIDS tide.\r\nThe launch at Safari Park Hotel officially\r\nkicks off this three-year project funded\r\nby the European Union to the tune of\r\nSh.256,621,SOO covering a period of three\r\nyears.\r\nThe project is meant to enhance\r\npreventive behaviour to bring about a\r\nsignificant reduction in HIV /AIDS prevalence\r\nrates among the youth aged between 12\r\n- 24 years.\r\nIt aims at providing voluntary counselling\r\nand testing services to 36,000 youth\r\nwithin a period of three years and building\r\nthe capacity of both public and private in\r\npreventiGn, care and support systems.\r\nExpected to grace the launch, are the\r\nMinister for Health, the German Ambassador\r\nto Kenya (who is the representative of the EU\r\nPresidency in Kenya) and the Head of the EU\r\ndelegation among other dignitaries.\r\nThis initiative is meant to bridge the gap\r\nfor an unmet need for VCT services in the\r\ncountry and especially among the youth.\r\nThe vast majority of people living with HIV\r\nstill do not know their status. This is despite\r\nKenya having been noted for achievements\r\nin battling the HIV epidemic. A recent decline\r\nin national prevalence seems to underline\r\nthe country's successful approach in the war\r\nagainst the pandemic.\r\nAccording to the 2003 Kenya Demographic\r\nand Health Survey, only 14 per cent of men\r\nand 13 per cent of women aged 15-49 years\r\nhave tested for HIV. Despite massive national\r\ncampaigns, there remains a large unmet\r\nneed for HIV testing and counselling.\r\nFor those individual, who do not seek\r\nroutine or curative health services, VCT\r\nremains an essential mechanism through\r\nwhich they can learn about their HIV status\r\nand reduce HIV transmission. Research\r\nconducted in Kenya by the johns Hopkins\r\nUniversity, School of Hygiene and Public\r\nHealth estimates that one VCT prevents\r\n1,104 infections.\r\nUsing four trucks, DSW will run mobile\r\nVCT services - or \"VCT on wheels\" - aimed\r\nat reaching young people who shy away\r\nfrom visiting normal stationary facilities to\r\nestablish their HIV status and obtain other\r\nservices or are discouraged by distance.\r\nThe basis of this new component of DSW's\r\nwork revolves around four mobile trucks,\r\nwhich will be fully equipped and fabricated\r\nto suit a youth-friendly VCT service. The\r\ntrucks will be operational within four Kenyan\r\nprovinces, namely Coast, Central, Western/\r\nRift Valley and Nyanza, thus bringing VCT\r\nservices to the young people, rather than\r\nletting them invest time, money and energy\r\ninto locating a VCT.\r\nThe programme is being implemented\r\nin 16 districts in Kenya in Eastern, Nairobi,\r\nCoast, Western and Nyanza Provi nces. The\r\ndistricts covered under the program are\r\nNairobi, Bondo, Migori, Kisumu, Kakamega,\r\nBungoma, Trans-Nzoia, Mumias Butere, Kilifi,\r\nKwale, Mombasa,\r\nKaloleni, Meru\r\nCentral, Meru South,\r\nEmbu and Kirinyaga.\r\nThe mobile\r\nVCT programme\r\nencompasses\r\ncomponents of\r\nfour mobile VCT\r\ntrucks, support to\r\nexisting static VCTs,\r\nhome-based care,\r\npeer education and\r\ncreating awareness\r\non adolescent sexual\r\nand reproductive health (ASRH). services for\r\nyoung persons in targeted districts among\r\nothers.\r\nThis innovative component is a DSW\r\naddition to its youth-friendly programmes\r\nin the country offered under the Youth-toYouth\r\nbanner.\r\nThe initiative is aimed at enhancing\r\nawareness and knowledge about HIV/AID5\r\nand VCTs through community mobilisation\r\nand sensitization. It will make available\r\nyouthMfriendly, approachable and affordable\r\nVCTs.\r\nFurther, the project will establish a\r\ncommunity home-based care support\r\nand referral network. It will also deliver\r\nhigh quality VCT servicesthrough quality\r\nassurance.\r\nYoung people, particularly vulnerable\r\nto HIV for social, cultural, biological, and\r\neconomic reasons, often feel threatened\r\nby the idea of going to VCTs, which to date\r\nhave been more adult-orientated. These\r\nare perceived to be 'scary' entities and are\r\nassociated with being tools of extensive\r\nstigmatisation.\r\nThe cost and distance involved in\r\naccessing a VCT also pose an obstacle,\r\ncontributing little to bringing down\r\nprevalence rates among young people,\r\nespecially the most vulnerable and least\r\naccessible.\r\nAlthough VCT services are at the heart of\r\nthis project, DSW covers more than only one\r\ncomponent along the chain of HIV infection.\r\nPrevention through youth-club based\r\neducation and awareness campaigns, as well\r\nas post-infection care through youth-friendly\r\nhome-based care form the remaining two\r\npillars of this project. In line with D5W's Y2Y\r\napproach, this project is run by youth for\r\nyouth.\r\nAccess to HIV/AIDS prevention and care\r\nservices, as well as accompanying awareness\r\nactivities provided through this project are\r\nenvisaged to significantly reduce HIVjAIDS\r\nprevalence amongst the most vulnerable and\r\nf!larginalised young people, particularly girls\r\nand young women.\r\nHowever, the project also aims tobring\r\nabout positive change in behavioural\r\nstandards that go beyond HIV/AIDS\r\nprevention.\r\nAmong these are young people's attitude\r\ntowards negative societal influences and\r\nharmful customs that have contributed\r\nto the mass spread of HIV/Aids and other\r\nreproductive health ailments. Such variation\r\nin thought, attitude and behaviour will go a\r\nlong way in directing young people to lead a\r\nhealthier life and ultimately contribute to the\r\ngeneral well-being of society."}
