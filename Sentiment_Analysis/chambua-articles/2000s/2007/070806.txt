{"text": "NATION  6 August, 2007\r\n\r\nLIVING POSITIVELY\r\n\r\nJuggling motherhood and career\r\nHIV only adds to the equation and requires\r\nunderstanding at home and at the office\r\n\r\nYou will excuse me now,\" I apologised\r\nprofusely to my colleagues. We were\r\nat a farewell party for one of our\r\nmembers of staff and Iwanted to go and attend\r\nto my son, Joshua.\r\nBefore Joshua came into the picture, I\r\nwould attend any function without a second\r\nthrought. After all, Peter was virtually\r\nhis own man and could take care of himself\r\nwithout mum's shadow hovering over\r\nhim. And my stepdaughters - Kadogo and\r\nNyambura - are used to my busy schedule\r\nand hold the fort whenever I am out of the\r\ncountry.\r\nThanks to Joshua, things have changed.\r\nI am grateful for what Kadogo, Nyambura\r\nand my partner, Richard, are doing, but I\r\nalso know I have to make time to be with\r\nJoshua. At times it is hard juggling a career\r\nthat is as demanding as mine and motherhood,\r\nwhich has its own set of demands. '\r\nBut I am also aware that the only way I\r\ncan bond with my son is by spending lots\r\nof quality time with him and not buying\r\nexpensive stuff to replace my physical presence.\r\nAs mothers, our natural instincts are\r\n\"to have and hold\" our babies and leaving\r\nthem in somebody else's care is just a temporary\r\nmeasure that is brought about by\r\n- for instance - the lanes we choose in life.\r\nJuggling career and motherhood requires\r\npersonal tact and support from both the office\r\nand home. There are days I leave the office\r\nearly, while at other times I report late\r\nso that I can spend that extra moment with\r\nJosh\\,Ja. And in trying to share any extra\r\nminute with my son, I find that at times\r\nJoshua puts me in a tight spot.\r\n\"I don't want other people to know this,\"\r\nI confided in a friend recently. \"At times\r\nwhen I'm running late and Joshua has decided\r\nthat he won't eat, I am forced to put the\r\nfood on my thumb and force-feed him.\"\r\nThere;s this time that he splashed me\r\nwith porridge when I was feeding him. Obviously,\r\nI got late because I had to clean up\r\nand change my clothes. \"Now I'll be caught\r\nin that gridlock along juja Road,\" I complained.\r\nBut the f1ipside is that, in cleaning\r\nup and changing, I got to spend extra time\r\nwith him.\r\nI've talked about juggling two balls, but\r\nwhen you add one more -living with HIV\r\n- to the equation, then it requires a third\r\ningredient from both fronts: understanding,\r\nThere are days when I feel like not reporting\r\nto the office or attending to anyone, however\r\nurgent their problem might be.\r\nFortunately, my colleagues understand.\r\nI have lived with HIV for almost two\r\ndecades now, but I still have \"those days\"\r\nwhen stress grips me by the jugular. It is\r\nnormal, a friend empathised with me. Later,\r\nwhen I thought deeply about it, I realised\r\nthat it is normal now that I have a baby\r\nwhom I want to live for and a virus that\r\nwants me dead.\r\n\"I don't know how to put a picture as a\r\ncomputer's screensaver,\" I told one of my\r\ncolleagues after asking him to hang up\r\nJoshua's picture above a bookshelf. Now I\r\ncan just look into his smiling face whenever\r\nI miss him and concentrate on my work.\r\nMy heart goes out to the other mothers\r\nout there living with HIV but who have\r\nno support systems to help mitigate their\r\nsituations. There are still institutions that\r\ndon't have HIV workplace policies and their\r\nHIV positive employees live in fear, denial,\r\nprejudice and silent desperation.
