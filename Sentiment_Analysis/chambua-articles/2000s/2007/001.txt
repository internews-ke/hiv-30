CARLETON VILLE, South Africa, Wednesday.

After years of limited success
cajoling and- pleading’with
miners to voluntarily test
to check their HIV status mining firm Gold Fields adopted
moderm marketing tactics.
“We said let's up the game,
let’s dangle a carrot so people can come and know their
status". Štella Ntimbane, group HIV/AIDS coordinator gor Gold fields.
Now each of the company's miners who
takes an HIV/AIDS test gets a
lottery ticket, offering chances at monthy prices of cell
phones, televisions and cash,
plus a final sweepstake. One
lucky worker will drive away a new pick-up truck. 
It is just one example of
how firms are stepping up the
battle against a disease affect
ing up to onç in three miners.
They are also sending mobile treatment
units to the bush near mines where sex workers operate and blanketing the region with millions of condoms.
