PHARMACEUTICALS

Agency says G8 may
tighten patent rules
This may make
Aids drugs too
expensive for
Mrican states

By KABURU MUGAMBI in

Heiligendamm, Germany
International humanitarR
ian aid organisation, Me~
decins Sans Frontieres,
has expressed fears that
the developed countries meeting
here in Germany would
strengthen pharmaceutical
patent rules to protect their
drug manufacturers.
Tightening the patent laws,
the organisation says would
make people especially in
Mica lack enough access to
medicine. Medecines Sans
Frontieres (MSF) or doctors
without borders coordinator
Oliver Moldenhaner told reporters
on the sidelines of the
G8 summit, that developed
countries should allow poor
countries produce or to import
generic medicines without the
consent ofthe patent holder.
"We foresee G8 leaders trying
to tighten patent laws
to restrict access to generic
medicines, which have led to
massive reduction in medicine
prices and it is very unfortunate;'
Mr Moldenhauer said
yesterday at Rostock city. The
single most important factor
in forcing down the prices of
medicines is generic competi7
tion. The lowest priced Aids
drug plummeted from more
thau $10,000 (Sh690,000) per
patient per year to less than
$200 (Sh13,800) between
2000 aud 2004. A drug's patent
holders can sell the medicine
at any price for the duration
of the patent: usually 20
years.
"Prote~ti()n ofpatents seems
very importaut iu developed
countlies, but they forget the
problehlof medicine in developing
countries;' Mr Moldenhauer
said. "You can't treat
medicine like shoes?'

The,rules governingphar~

shrined in the 'frade Related
Aspects of Intellectual Property
RIghts (1tips) Agreement
of the World 'frade Organisation
(WTO), signed in 1994.
The agreement includes safeguards
that countries can use
to ensure patents do not limit
access to medicines.
For instance, countries can
allow the production or importation
of generic medicines
without consent of the

cheapest available version of

global market. MSF appealed
for the implementation of natioual
regniations that would
offer maximum, flexibility to
set patents asiele in order to
'{promote acces$>:t() medicines

been exerting press~e on the
two countries to cease production.-
"MSF is also calliBgon ~overmnents

he added.
'{These agreements'iinpose

the use of more affordable, generic
medicines in other ways?'
It called on governments and
pharmaceutical companies to
finance research in developing
drugs for what it called forgotten
diseases.
It said sleeping sickness, tuberculosis
and malariakill millions
of people every year, but
attract little interest from drug
finns. wThis is compoundedby
the fact that governments and
the international community
have failed to encourage research
and development of
new drugs
