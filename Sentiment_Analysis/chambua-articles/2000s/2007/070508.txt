{"text": "DAILY NATION Friday June 8, 2007\r\n\r\nPHARMACEUTICALS\r\n\r\nAgency says G8 may\r\ntighten patent rules\r\nThis may make\r\nAids drugs too\r\nexpensive for\r\nMrican states\r\n\r\nBy KABURU MUGAMBI in\r\n\r\nHeiligendamm, Germany\r\nInternational humanitarR\r\nian aid organisation, Me~\r\ndecins Sans Frontieres,\r\nhas expressed fears that\r\nthe developed countries meeting\r\nhere in Germany would\r\nstrengthen pharmaceutical\r\npatent rules to protect their\r\ndrug manufacturers.\r\nTightening the patent laws,\r\nthe organisation says would\r\nmake people especially in\r\nMica lack enough access to\r\nmedicine. Medecines Sans\r\nFrontieres (MSF) or doctors\r\nwithout borders coordinator\r\nOliver Moldenhaner told reporters\r\non the sidelines of the\r\nG8 summit, that developed\r\ncountries should allow poor\r\ncountries produce or to import\r\ngeneric medicines without the\r\nconsent ofthe patent holder.\r\n\"We foresee G8 leaders trying\r\nto tighten patent laws\r\nto restrict access to generic\r\nmedicines, which have led to\r\nmassive reduction in medicine\r\nprices and it is very unfortunate;'\r\nMr Moldenhauer said\r\nyesterday at Rostock city. The\r\nsingle most important factor\r\nin forcing down the prices of\r\nmedicines is generic competi7\r\ntion. The lowest priced Aids\r\ndrug plummeted from more\r\nthau $10,000 (Sh690,000) per\r\npatient per year to less than\r\n$200 (Sh13,800) between\r\n2000 aud 2004. A drug's patent\r\nholders can sell the medicine\r\nat any price for the duration\r\nof the patent: usually 20\r\nyears.\r\n\"Prote~ti()n ofpatents seems\r\nvery importaut iu developed\r\ncountlies, but they forget the\r\nproblehlof medicine in developing\r\ncountries;' Mr Moldenhauer\r\nsaid. \"You can't treat\r\nmedicine like shoes?'\r\nSa.feguards\r\nThe,rules governingphar~\r\naceutical patents areen-:\r\nshrined in the 'frade Related\r\nAspects of Intellectual Property\r\nRIghts (1tips) Agreement\r\nof the World 'frade Organisation\r\n(WTO), signed in 1994.\r\nThe agreement includes safeguards\r\nthat countries can use\r\nto ensure patents do not limit\r\naccess to medicines.\r\nFor instance, countries can\r\nallow the production or importation\r\nof generic medicines\r\nwithout consent of the\r\nRich countries\r\nshould know\r\nbetter than to\r\ntreat medicines\r\nlike shoes\r\npatent holder, or look for the\r\ncheapest available version of\r\nthe braud-name dlUg on the\r\nglobal market.
