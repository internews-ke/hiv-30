{"text": "DAILY NATION Thursday June 7, 2007\r\n\r\nEC project to help the vulnerable cope with HIV/AIDS\r\n\r\nThe HIV/AIDS project targeting those most at\r\nrisk from and affected by the disease is expected\r\nto improve their lives in many ways. It will help\r\nthem to better tackle or cope with the HIV/AlDS\r\nchallenge.\r\nThose targeted by the project will be provided\r\nwith free subsidized HN/AIDS services.\r\nThey will also get comprehensive access to HIV/\r\nAIDS prevention, care and treatment:\r\nIt is expected that the target groups will\r\nbe empowered through raised awareness and\r\nsustained, positive behaviour change.\r\nThe project, funded by the EC ~ European\r\nCommission ~ , will also provide improved quality\r\nof sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and HIVj\r\nAIDS services.\r\nThe Ministry of Health, especially at the district\r\nlevel, will gain managerially and technically by\r\nhaving their capacity built to provide better quality\r\nSRH and HIV/AlDS services to local beneficiaries.\r\nPoor and vulnerable women and men of\r\nreproductive age shall benefit by some being\r\nidentified and selected to be community~basedhealth\r\nworkers (CBHWs) and youth peer educators (YFEs) on\r\nthe project, which will not only increase their levels of\r\nunderstanding of SRH and HN/AIDS, but also decrease\r\ntheir families' susceptibility to the disease.\r\nIt will also provide them with some income which win\r\nraise their standards of living and lift their households\r\nout of poverty.\r\nThe public and private health providers, non~\r\ngovernmental organizations (NGOs) and community~\r\nbased organizations (CBOs) that are part of the HN/AIDS\r\nPPP (Public\ufffdprivate partnership) referral network will\r\nbenefit from regular exchanges of information, lessons\r\nlearned and best practice.\r\nIn addition, they will benefit from a complementary\r\nand harroonised approach to providing SRH and\r\nHlY/AIDS services, whereby each member will not be\r\ncompeting with other providers for beneficiaries and\r\nclients to use their services.\r\nThis will increase efficiency and focus on serving the\r\nneeds and demands of the target groups.\r\nCBHWs and YFEs will be trained in SRH and HIV/\r\nAIDS awareness and knowledge which they will use when\r\nvisiting communities and special target groups, such as\r\nwomen's associations and out-of-school youth groups.\r\nCBHWs and YFEs will also benefit from learning how\r\nto use information, education and communication (IEC)\r\nand behaviour change communication (BCC) materials\r\nto support their work and how to organise and conduct\r\nparticipatory awareness raising sessions on HN/AIDS.\r\nThis will be important in facilitating increased\r\nawareness and positive behaviour change among the\r\nbeneficiary groups, as well as mobilizing clients to access\r\nSRH and HIV/AIDS services.\r\nCommunity leaders will benefit from enhanced\r\nunderstanding of SRH and HIV/AIDS, allowing them to\r\nbe of greater positive influence within their community.\r\nYoung people will gain from the project by some of\r\nthem being selected to work as YFEs to support the IEC\r\nand BCC activities, which will decrease their vulnerability\r\nto poor sexual and reproductive health or infection\r\nHly/AIDS."}
