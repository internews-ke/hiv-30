{"text": "DAILY NATION Thursday June 14, 2007\r\n\r\nDSW LAUNCHES\r\nYOUTH-FRIENDLY MOBILE VCT\r\n\r\nGerman Foundation for World\r\nPopulation (DSW) seeks to\r\neconomically empower youth\r\nto shun behaviours that\r\nexpose them to reproductive health\r\nrisks. This is over and above providing\r\nsexual and reproductive health services\r\nand information to young people.\r\nThe poor economic status of\r\nmany young people in the country\r\ncompromises their ability to tackle\r\nsexual and reproductive health\r\nchallenges.\r\nYoung people today face many\r\nreproductive health challenges which\r\ninclude sexually transmitted infections,\r\nHIV/AIDS, teenage pregnancy, unsafe\r\nabortion, school dropout. harmful\r\npractices like early marriages, female\r\ngenital mutilation, sexual violence,\r\nand.drug and substance abuse among\r\nothers.\r\nReproductive health education must\r\ndeal with the broader context of sexual\r\nbehaviour, Economic disadvantage\r\nsignificantly affects young people's\r\nsexual behaviour and experiences in a\r\nnumber of ways. Although exchanging\r\nsex for money, goods or favours is what\r\nsprings to mind, recent research shows\r\nthat a wide range of risky behaviours is\r\ninfluenced by poverty. In addition to the\r\nfact that being from a poorer household\r\nincreases the likelihood of exchanging\r\nsex, it also:\r\n\" raises a young woman's chances of\r\nexperiencing non-consensual sex\r\n\ufffd increases the likelihood of having\r\nmultiple sex partners (both men and\r\nwomen)\r\n\ufffd lowers the chances of secondary\r\nabstinence\r\n\ufffd decreases the likelihood of condom\r\nuse during the last sexual intercourse\r\nand\r\n\ufffd lowers the average age of first\r\nsexual experience for boys and girls.\r\nFurthermore, impoverished young\r\npeople, especially young women,\r\nare the most disadvantaged when it\r\ncomes to discussing sensitive topics\r\nsuch as condom use with their sexual\r\npartners. Enhancing negotiation and\r\ncommunication skills is a starting point,\r\n\r\n\r\nEmpowering young people for\r\nimproved reproductive health\r\n\r\nbut young people also need strategies\r\nfor building economic and social assets.\r\nWhat DSW is doing to\r\neconomically empower\r\nyoung people\r\nAs part of DSW's Youth-to-Youth\r\n(Y2Yj programme, youth clubs are\r\ngiven assistance in identifying viable\r\nincome generating activities (IGAs).\r\nYoung people receive training on the\r\ndevelopment and management of\r\nIGAs, and specialised skills training, if\r\nnecessary.\r\nThey are then provided with a small\r\nstart-up funding, as a no-interest loan.\r\nOnce the initial investment has\r\nbeen recouped and the loan repaid\r\n(which is then used as seed funding\r\nfor another club), the clubs themselves\r\ndecide how best to use the proceeds of\r\ntheir activities to further support club\r\nactivities.\r\nIncome generating opportunities\r\ncover a wide range of activities,\r\nincluding traditional bee-keeping,\r\npoultry-rearing weaving, but also\r\ntheatre and internet cafes.\r\nThrough the provision of transport\r\nservices, public showers, barber shops\r\nand related low capital services, IGAs\r\nalso benefit entire communities by\r\nfilling gaps in and supporting essential\r\ncommunity services.\r\nOne youth club in Uganda chose\r\npoultry as an IGA. Roosters and hens\r\nwere bought, and after selling enough\r\neggs and chicks to repay the loan,\r\nclub members decided to give each of\r\nthe young people involved in the IGA\r\none hen and one rooster for own use.\r\nThe remaining birds were kept and\r\nmaintained by the club, with proceeds\r\nfunding club activities. In this way, a\r\ni simple IGA:\r\n\" contributes to improved nutritional\r\nstatus and income at household level\r\n\ufffd supports ongoing club activities and\r\n\ufffd raises the profile and status of the\r\nclub and club members within the\r\ncommunity.\r\n-Approachable, free and accessible VeT services\r\nThe launch of the Youth-Friendly mobile voluntary\r\ncounselling and testing centres (VCTs) immensely\r\nboosts DSW's advocacy for young people's sexual and\r\nreproductive health. Working with public and private\r\nhealth organizations. DSW will provide youth friendly,\r\napproachable, free and accessible VeT services with the\r\ntrucks covering set circuits in the districts where the\r\nprogramme will be implemented.\r\nDSW has established an operational working\r\npartnership with National AIDS and STDs Control\r\nProgramme (NASCOPj, district health service providers/\r\nstakeholders, youth networks in Coast, Western,\r\nNyanza, Eastern and Nairobi regions where the\r\nprogramme will be implemented.\r\nThrough the mobile VCT, the organization intends\r\nto establish an extensive community-based referral\r\nnetwork and home-based care {HBC} support system.\r\nYoung people who visit the mobile VCTs and who need\r\nto obtain other services will be referred to institutions\r\nthat can offer them the kind of services they needed.\r\nThose living with HIV/AIDS will be helped to access\r\nhome-based care.\r\nThrough training, DSW hopes to enhance awareness,\r\nknowledge and skills about HIV/Aids and VCT among\r\nyouth, community members. leaders and service\r\nproviders in the project areas.\r\nDSW would like to ensure high quality youth\r\nfriendly services including veTs are delivered through\r\nstrengthening the capacity of relevant actors and\r\nquality assurance systems at the natioriallevel and in\r\nthe targeted districts.\r\nAt the end of the project. the organization plans to\r\ndocument and the experiences and lessons learnt from\r\nthe project to be shared widely with stakeholders.\r\nWhy focus on Kenya?\r\nKenya is home to approximately 34.7 million people,\r\n43 per cent of whom are under 15 years of age. Sexual\r\nactivity among adolescents is high. Factors such as\r\nbiological, social and economic hardships, urbanisation,\r\nschooling and weakening traditional structures have a\r\nnegative impact on young people's sexual behaviour.\r\nAs a result, young people in Kenya face a host of\r\nthreats to their sexual and reproductive health. What is\r\nneeded are comprehensive health programmes aimed\r\nat decreasing the risk of early and unwanted pregnancy,\r\nunsafe abortion and sexually transmitted infections\r\nincluding HIV/AIDS.\r\nWhere it all began\r\nDSW Kenya is a non-governmental organisation\r\ncommitted to addressing young people's sexual and\r\nreproductive health needs throughout the country.\r\nYouth-to-Youth (Y2Y) - a comprehensive programme\r\ndesigned to improve the sexual and reproductive health\r\nof young people by young people - is at the heart of all\r\nactivities.\r\nDSW Kenya also provides capacity-building for a\r\nwide range of civ.iI society organi~ationsand promotes\r\nadvocacy for sexual and reproductive health, as well as\r\nnetworking and collaboration amongst key players in\r\npopulation and development.\r\nIncidentally, Kenya is where it all began. DSW\r\nlaunched its first family planning project in 1992.\r\nDSW's presence in Kenya was strengthened with\r\nthe establishment of its country office in May 2000.\r\nAlongside the main office in Nairobi. the Kenyan\r\ncountry programme is also run by three regional\r\noffices, located in Eastern, Western and Coast Province,\r\nrespectively.\r\nThe Y2Y programme\r\nThe Y2Y programme in Kenya spans five regions,\r\nnamely Western, Nairobi/Central, Nyanza. Rift Valley\r\nand Coastal Province, and is implemented by OSW in\r\nco-opera~tion with over a dozen partner organisations.\r\nThe country~wideyouth club network has\r\ncontinuously grown and currently comprises more than\r\n170 active clubs, which have contributed significantly\r\nto improving young Kenyan's sexual and reproductive\r\nhealth, self-esteem and social participation.\r\nEmphasis is laid on the most vulnerable populations.\r\nThrough the so-called \"KQMA\" network, DSW reaches\r\nout to young people living in the Korogocho and\r\nMathare slums of Nairobi, 85 per cent of which are\r\nsexually active, but lack access to contraceptives and\r\nsexual and reproductive health education and services.\r\nThe concept of youth-friendly mobile voluntary\r\ncounselling and testing (VCT) services forms a new\r\npillar of the Y2Y programme in Kenya.\r\nEarly diagnosis is key to averting HIV, sothis new\r\ncomponent of OSW's work is a valuable addition. With\r\nthis service, DSW is enabled to provide mobile VCT and\r\nincrease overall access to HIV/AIDS prevention and\r\nhome-based care for young people.\r\nStrengthening civil society\r\nDevelopments related to the implementation of\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals, the Paris Aid\r\nDeclaration etc. mean that the Kenyan government\r\nis increasingly in charge of poverty reduction efforts\r\nand development assistance priorities, including the\r\nPoverty Reduction Strategies Papers and the European\r\nUnion's Country Strategies Papers. Consequently.\r\nstrengthening Kenyan civil society participation in\r\nthe development of these strategies is of paramount\r\nimportance. DSW's advocacy activities in Kenya\r\ntherefore aim to strengthen the capacity of civil\r\nsociety organisations to campaign around sexual and\r\nreproductive health. Additionally, DSW's efforts are\r\ndesigned to establish and nurture relationships with key\r\nregional policy and deds\ufffdlon~makers.\r\nFor further information Contact:\r\nDSW Kenya Country Office\r\nTel: 020 3870448/2731398\r\nFax: 020 3877212\r\nemail: dswkenya.org\r\ninfo@dsw-hannover.de\r\ni www.dsw-online.de"}
