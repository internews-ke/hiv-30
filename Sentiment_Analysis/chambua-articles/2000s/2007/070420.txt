{"text": "20 MAR 2007\r\n\r\nCASE FOR CONJUGAL VISITS IN PRISONS\r\n\r\nFollowing \"Family Day\" at\r\nthe Shima la Tewa Prison\r\nlast week, conjugal visits\r\nand Kenya's prisoner rights\r\nto them, have many a Kenyan\r\nperson rather steamy, hot and\r\nbothered\" And I'm not just talking\r\nabout a prisoner like Mohamed Abdulralunan\r\nwho, while admitting to\r\nhaving his body \"on fire;' reportedly\r\nbegged the government for relief because\r\n\"I had really prepared for this\r\nbig day. I had expected to have private\r\nmoments with my beloved one\r\n... even for 15 minutes ... I have been\r\nlanguishing in prison for years (sexually\r\nstarved):'\r\nThough now a topic of discussion in\r\nKenya, conjugal rights have for decades\r\nbeen an issue of controversy\r\nworldwide. They featured most recentlyin\r\nPakistan Vlhere, in a similar\r\nplea to the federal government, Governor\r\nKhalid Maqbool requested its\r\namendment of Prison Rules 1978 so\r\nthat prisoners can meet their spouses\r\nin jail. The amendment to Section\r\n545-A read in part that \"a prisoner\r\nconvicted for a term exceeding five\r\nyears shall be allowed to keep with\r\nhim his spouse\" and that \"this right\r\nmaybe exercised three times in a year\r\nfor three consecutive days provided\r\nthat where a male convict has more\r\nthan one wife, each of them shall be\r\nallowed to remain with the convict\r\nfor three consecutive days.. :'\r\nIndividuals like Kenya's Bishop Boniface\r\nLele would agree with this. Such\r\nprovisions, he has said, are important\r\nfor \"enhancing marriage values\" and,\r\nwithout a doubt, this is true. Conjugal\r\nvisits have been credited with keeping\r\nmarriages intact and for easing\r\nthe burden of imprisonment on the\r\npart of the prisoner's spouse. Yet, interestingly\r\nenough, as history shows,\r\nthis right did not originate from such\r\nconsiderations.\r\nConjugal visitations (at least in\r\nAmerican penal institutions) were\r\nfirst heard of at the Mississippi State\r\nPenitentiary (MSP) in Parchman as\r\nearly as 1918 though it is believed\r\nthey had probably been around since\r\n1900. And the reason for their introduction?\r\nJames Parchman, the Prison\r\nWarden and also Plantation Manager,\r\nbelieved that blacks possessed an\r\ninsatiable sexual appetite and that,\r\nby offering them sexual favours, he\r\ncould increase their output. Located\r\non approximately 18,000 acres, the\r\nMSP is an agricultural enterprise\r\nwhich, up until this day, produces,\r\nconsumes and sells all of its mvn produce.\r\nPaving the way for the prison's\r\n2006's harvesting of4,141,381 pounds\r\nofvegetables or its marketing of5,159\r\nfeeder hogs fetching $583,604 on\r\n716,160 ofman hours worked, Parchman\r\nbuilt the prisoners \"red houses\"\r\nnext to the fields where they worked.\r\nHere, they canoodled with wives and\r\ngirlfriends. Prostitutes, it is said, were\r\nnot an uncommon sight either.\r\nIn 1972, following years of increased\r\nscrutiny, the \"red houses\" were ripped\r\ndown and replaced with modern facilities\r\n\ufffd accompanied by institutionalised\r\nprocesses limiting conjugal\r\nrights to married prisoners alone.\r\nMWENDEMWINZI\r\nToday, California, Connecticut, New\r\nMexico, New York and Washington\r\npermit such interactions. And MSP's\r\nimpact has stretched even further -\r\ninto Israel via Larissa Timbobler\r\nand Yigal Amir. Remember him? You\r\nshould. It was he that assassinated\r\nPrime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. Itwas\r\nalso he that, after a two-year petition,\r\nwon the right to consummate his\r\nmarriage only months before Rabin's\r\nfirst memorial. He, the court decided,\r\nwas entitled to basic rights including\r\nthe right to fatherhood. During their\r\nfirst such visit together, Larissa and\r\nYigal reportedly romped for a very\r\nspecial eight-and-a-halfhours.\r\nFrance and Canada welcome prisoners\r\ninto decorated home-like apartments\r\nfor such rendezvous and in\r\nRussia well-behaved prisoners get\r\ntwo annual visits lasting up to three\r\ndays each time. Is it not time perhaps\r\nthat Kenya, too, gave this some\r\nthought?\r\nWhile the country undoubtedly has\r\ncapacity issues to consider (there's\r\nnot enough space for prisoners\r\nleave alone private areas required\r\nfor conjugal visits), there are several\r\nreasons to think about it. If only for\r\ndovvn the road. Conjugal visitation\r\nprogrammes are believed to not only\r\ncurb prison-induced homosexuality\r\nwhich, propelled by control or sexual\r\nrelief issues, contributes to the escalation\r\nof HIV infection in prisons\r\nworldwide (more so where condoms\r\nare not distributed in prisons), but\r\nthey also inhibit recidlvism and the\r\nre-assimilation into society through\r\ntheir focus on family ties. Ties with\r\nfamily members and other intimate\r\ncircles are of significant importance\r\nto the inmate and their successful return\r\nto society.\r\nYet that is not to say that such rights\r\nshould not be earned. These are, after\r\nall, the same individuals who have no\r\nregard for the law or society and who\r\nhave killed, molested, robbed and\r\nmaimed us! Extending them these\r\ncourtesies should not only be conditional\r\nbut also structured such that in\r\nthe long run, they benefit the broader\r\nsociety..As is the case in the countries\r\nTies with members of\r\nfamily and other intimate\r\ncircles are ofsignificant\r\nimportance to inrnat~s\r\nand their successful\r\nreturn to society\r\nthat offer them, conjugal rights must\r\nbe tied to certain requirements ofthe\r\nprisoner. While these vary by prison\r\nand country, they geIJ,erally revolve\r\naround the length of thg\" prisoner's\r\nsentence, their behaviour (in some\r\ninstances there must be a record of\r\ngood behaviour for six months or\r\nmore) and the absence of sexually\r\ntransmitted diseases. When they are\r\naccorded (and this is always in a controlled\r\nsetting), it is not because they\r\nare viewed as a luxury but rather because\r\nthose extending them recognise\r\nthat prisoners, as people, constitute\r\npart of society and that they\r\nare, therefore, entitled to the basic,\r\nnatural rights that all humans enjoy.\r\nIt sounds simple enough, doesn't it?\r\nWell, it's not.\r\nOnce they open this, countries are\r\nbeing forced to contend with issues\r\nrather unexpected. For instance,\r\nshould such rights be restricted to\r\nspouses alone as is typically the case\r\nor should partners and girlfriends\r\nbe qualified as well? And, speaking\r\nof partners, what should happen in\r\nthe case of homosexuals? While this\r\nthought might be too radical for the\r\naverage Kenyan today, it is noteworthy\r\nthat in Brazil, male prisoners are\r\neligible for visits from both heterosexuals\r\nand, where applicable, homosexual\r\npartners. Why? Because\r\neven though an inmate has lost their\r\nright to freedom, their partner still\r\nhas their right to intimacy without\r\nresorting to divorce or adultery\r\nmwendemwinzi@yahoo.com"}
