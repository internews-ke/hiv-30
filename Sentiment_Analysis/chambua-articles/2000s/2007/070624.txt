John Njue,\r\nChairman, Kenya Episcopal Conference.\r\nThe preparation of the national Catholic\r\nAIDS policy 'This We Teach and Do' has\r\nbeen in many ways a journey of faith. This\r\nhas necessitated a deeper examination of\r\nthe nature of the challenge of HIVjAIDS in the face\r\nof over twenty years of the Church's experience in\r\nthe broad arena of service delivery, in Preventive\r\nand Curative measures and the complex problem\r\nof orphans & vulnerable children\r\nWhile the way forward has not always been\r\nclear, the Church has never hesitated to provide\r\nservice and leadership even in difficult areas\r\ndespite limited resources. We have provided care\r\nfor the sick, prevention programs particu larly for\r\nthe youth, mother to child prevention programs\r\nand assistance to OVCs.\r\nWhile doing all these we have, in reviewing\r\nour actions, our successes and our failures, felt\r\nthe need to work out clear guidelines and broad\r\nstrategies to provide a roadmap for our various\r\nparishes, diocesan institutions and national\r\nstructures upon which many Kenyans rely for\r\nvarious types of support and services,\r\nCatholic HIV and AIDS Policy in Kenya, is thus\r\nmeant to\r\nThe Most Rev.\r\nJohn Njue\r\n(1.)Give a collective sense of direction, overall\r\nguidance. justification and reflection on the\r\nChurch practice with regard to HIVjAIDS.\r\n(2.) Acknowledge what has been done so\r\nfar, encourage grassroots initiatives and give\r\nstructure for responses and programmes at all\r\nlevels.\r\n(3.) Serve as a point of reference, provide a\r\nframework and elaborate answers on difficult\r\nissues,\r\nThe Policy is thus both timely and needed and it\r\nwill be an appropriate conclusion to the end of the\r\nfirst ever National Catholic AIDS Conference.\r\nIt is my sincere hope that all the participants\r\nin the conference will examine the practicability\r\nof the Policy and share the acquired knowledge\r\nwith all agents of evangelization and partners who\r\nprovide us with assistance in many ways.\r\nThis policy will also be of particular use to\r\nthose who have to deal with challenging situations\r\neveryday, whether the challenge be moral, spiritual,\r\npsychological or material- for the faces of HIVj\r\nAIDS are many and everyone is called to action.\r\nAs the Policy so pointedly states 'We in all\r\nChurch efforts to prevent HIV from spreading, to\r\nheal illness and soothe suffering and to address\r\nthe painful consequences of the pandemic,\r\nthe duty of everyone involved - bishops, clergy,\r\nreligious, faithful - is to spread the Gospel and\r\nform consciences in the light of these values\".\r\nTherefore, we recommit ourselves to be faithful to\r\nJesus Christ in responding to the challenges posed\r\nby both sexuality and stigma.\r\nIn fidelity to the Gospel, our struggle against\r\nAIDS should never erode but always enhance the\r\ndignity and worth of each human person. And in\r\nresponse to the HIV pandemic, the Church carries\r\nout her mission at every level. We recognize and\r\nappreciate the impressive efforts made by many\r\nDioceses, Parishes, Congregations and the Faithful\r\nin responding generously, often under difficult\r\ncircumstances,\r\nWe join Pope John Paul II of venerable memory\r\nin recalling \"with admiration the many health~care\r\nworkers, chaplains and volunteers who, like Good\r\nSamaritans, assist persons with AIDS and care for\r\ntheir relatives.' In this regard, the service of the\r\nthousands of Catholic health~care institutions that\r\ngo to the help of people in Africa afflicted by every\r\nkind of illness, and especially by AIDS, malaria and\r\ntuberculosis, is invaluable,\"\r\nWe appreciate, thank and bless the clergy, the\r\nreiigious and the faithful involved in the ministry\r\nof the sick, in education and formation of youth, in\r\npastoral duties and home~based care, in projects\r\nlarge and small.\r\nWe appreciate the efforts being made in HIV\r\nand AIDS programmes by governmental and nongovernmental\r\ninstitutions when they encourage\r\nabstinence and fidelity as well as care for people\r\nliving with HIV and AIDS,\r\nWe honour the many families, widows, widowers\r\nand communities taking holistic care of their sick\r\nwith much love and sacrifice. We thank the families\r\nand institutions who care for orphans.\r\nWe applaUd the efforts made by Kenyan medical\r\npersonnel, both modern and trad'itional, in treating\r\nand caring for people living with HIV and AIDS; and\r\nby the counseliors who give hope to the infected.\r\nWe wholeheartedly support the involvement\r\nof conscientious parents, teachers, and religious\r\nleaders who take to heart the instruction\r\nand moral formation of children, youth and\r\ncommunities.\r\nIn conclusion and on behalf of the Kenya\r\nEpiscopal Conference, I wish to invite us ali to take\r\na deep look at the national Catholic AiDS policy for\r\ntherein is a portion for each one of us. It lays the\r\nfoundations for what we have been doing, what we\r\nare doing and what we shali continue doing.\r\nA life full of promise: Mombasa ave Project\r\n'J,\r\n--I\r\nand intelligent choices for themselves.\r\nIt was th'ls task force on cross cutt'lng issues\r\nwhich prepared the ground for the institution\r\nof Kenya Catholic HIVjAIDS Taskforce (KCHAT)\r\nas a technical advisory think tank for\r\nthe Kenya Episcopal Conference, which was\r\ncommissioned during the plenary assembly of\r\nthe Kenya Episcopal Conference in November\r\n2006. K-CHAT brought together several Catholic\r\nOrganizations who are major players or have a\r\nspecial interest in HIV/AIDS with the Secretary\r\nGeneral as Chairman. I w'lsh to thank all those in\r\nK-CHAT both organizations and individuals for a\r\njob well done.\r\nThe meeting of AMECEA (Association of\r\nMember Episcopal Conferences in Eastern Africa)\r\nin Kampala, Uganda in 2005 bringing together\r\nEpiscopal Conferences of Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya,\r\nTanzania, Uganda, Sudan, Malawi and Zambia,\r\nhad HIVJAIDS as the main agenda.\r\nThe AMECEA Bishops agreed that every\r\nConference rolls out the recommendations and\r\npicks up its priorities in the area of HIVjAIDS\r\nfor the next three years (till the next AMECEA\r\nmeeting in Zambia in 2008), Consequently, the\r\nKenya Episcopal Conference chose the following\r\npriority areas of development.\r\n(1.) Leadership Commitment by organizing\r\nworkshops for all Church leaders, clergy,\r\nReligious and Lay Leaders for training\r\ncapacity and awareness of HIVjAIDS. The\r\nKEC undertook to encourage more Lay\r\nparticipation in HIVjAID activities for\r\nprevention of infection, care for those\r\naffected, and training of more counselors.\r\n(2.) Advocacy enhancement by working out\r\nNational HIVjAIDS policy for the Catholic\r\nChurch and pushing for enhancement of laws\r\njlegal framework to protect hose infected and\r\naffected by the HIVjAIDS pandemic.\r\n(3.) Resource Mobilization by working out\r\ncommon partnerships at Local, National and\r\nInternational levels.\r\nKEC mandated the Kenya Catholic Secretariat\r\nto execute these priorities. Significant progress\r\nin the three areas of concern has been made;\r\nand with the assistance of K~CHAT, managed to\r\ncome up with the Kenya Catholic HIVjAIDS Policy\r\n'This We Teach and Do' which is n_ow ready for\r\nlaunching.\r\nOther achievements include the rolling out of\r\nprojects to provide Anti-Retroviral Therapy to\r\nover 30,000 persons and PMTCT programmes\r\nto over 100,000 expectant mothers. A lot\r\nstill remains to be done. This requires the\r\nCollaboration of all stakeholders and indeed we\r\nall are.\r\nAs we celebrate 20 years of intensive\r\ncommitment to stopping the spread of HIVjAIDS,\r\nwe wish to call upon all persons of good will to\r\nwork closely with the Catholic. Church to help roll\r\nout assistance in all areas to reach out to more\r\nneedy people.\r\nCross-cutting Issue\r\n1\r\nIn the year 2003 when the KEC - Catholic\r\nSecretariat undertook to prepare its strategic\r\nplan for the years 2004 - 2008, it was clearly\r\nseen that there was a necessity to manage\r\nthe HIVjAIDS Epidemic in a more cross cutting\r\nmanner as it impacted on the lives of people\r\nin a multiplicity of ways. Though primarily\r\na health issue, HIVjAIDS was noted to also\r\nimpact extensively on economic issues - such as\r\npoverty and productivity; on education, social\r\ndevelopment, lives of children, family and several\r\nother areas of life.\r\nA serious attempt to address this cross\r\ncutting aspect of the epidemic was made with a\r\ninter-commission task force being set up to look\r\ninto modalities of effecting this. This taskforce\r\nmade several recommendations including the\r\nneed to ensure that various aspects of HIVjAIDS\r\nwere captured in the various Commissions with\r\nthe KEC- Catholic Health Commission providing\r\ntechnical back up to the other Commissions.\r\nThe KEC~ Catholic]ustice & Peace Commission\r\nwas to pick up issues related to justice, access\r\nto drugs, as well as address the impact of issues\r\nlikely to fuel the spread of HIV such as wars,\r\ndisplacement of persons due to conflicts etc;\r\nthe Education Commission picked up training of\r\nyouth in school on abstinence, delay of the sexual\r\ndebut among school children, access of orphans\r\nto schooling: the Caritas Social development\r\nCommission started rolling out income\r\ngenerating activities for PLWAS especially\r\nwomen in order to address the increasing\r\npoverty arising from chronic illness and loss of\r\ncapacity to earn sufficient income to keep house\r\nholds running; the Social Communications\r\nCommission took up the challenge of continuing\r\nto create awareness among the people as well\r\nas educating and updating the public on new\r\ndevelopments and therapies; the Pastoral and\r\nLay Apostolate Commission continued its youth\r\nrelated programs either directly or through\r\nspecial projects such as Education for Life which\r\nempower young people to make life affirming'\r\nMessage from Very Rev. Fr. Vincent\r\nWambugu, Secretary General, Kenya\r\nEpiscopal Conference - Catholic Secretariat\r\neducation, passed well and through the project got a\r\nsponsor who pays her secondary education; she is in form\r\ntwo.\r\nHer younger sister is in primary school and is fully supported\r\nby the project while her elder sister has been linked to\r\nanother sponsor to help her through secondary education.\r\nThey all stay with their maternal auntie a village away from\r\ntheir own home. Priscilla and her sisters are bright children\r\nwho aspire to take up various professions on finishing\r\nschool and are grateful to the Archdiocese of Mombasa and\r\nChristain Relief Services for all the support they receive.\r\nVery Rev. Fr.\r\nVincent Wambugu\r\nRt. Rev. Philip\r\nSulumeti\r\nThe project has been able to consistently offer seryices to\r\nall the 20,000 OVC and 7,480 caregivers in Kilifi district, All\r\n7,480 households were offered counselling and guidance\r\nwhile the 12,200 OVC in primary school were supported\r\nwith school equipment, uniforms and levies for3,555\r\nchildren in Early Childhood Development Centres (ECD).\r\nUnder economic strengthening, a total of 385 ove were\r\nplaced in various village polytechnics for training in gainful\r\nskills through the vocational-training initiative. Other forms\r\nof support include medical services and food assistance to\r\nhouseholds in need.\r\nThree years down the line, Priscilla completed primary\r\nOur message to them is, \"the Church in Kenya has\r\nspoken, go and do whatever is necessary to bring\r\nabout hope and relief to your fellow Kenyans,\r\nIt is true that most if not all our 44 major hospitals\r\nspread allover Kenya offer subsidized or free\r\nAnti-retrovirals; it is true that close to 100 Health\r\nUnits including health centres offer services in\r\nthe prevention of mother to child transmission\r\nof HIV; it is true that many orphans find refuge in\r\nour children's homes and child survival programs;\r\nit is true that many youth are given life affirming\r\nabstinence messages from our programmes\r\nsuch us Education for Life and Abstinence and\r\nBehaviour-change for Youth (ABY). But all these are\r\nfar from enough,\r\nAs a Church, we need to learn better ways of\r\nrolling out programs even faster to all who need our\r\nassistance. We need to challenge ourselves to build\r\nour capacities to provide more excellent services.\r\nI We need to re-dedicate ourselves to provide\r\nI services with ever greater compassion. We have\r\ncome a long way but we need to go even further.\r\nThe needs of orphaned children get more acute\r\nevery day. Many persons who need ART have yet to\r\nbe reached, Many pregnant mothers are yet to be\r\navailed of the life saving service of PMTCT.\r\nThe conference provides us with an opportunity\r\nto stop a while, to share and celebrate our services,\r\nlearn new and better methods of service delivery\r\nand then - move on with greater confidence.\r\nAs is stated in the National Catholic AIDS policy,\r\n\"Thus the Church wants to reach out to PLWHA,\r\nwhether Catholic or not, in an integral. evangelical\r\nand holistic way. The first step is to appreciate their\r\nsituation and value the potential each one has.\r\nPLWHA need to be both challenged and helped to\r\nlive positively and to play their role in the Church's\r\nlife and ministry. Attending greatly to children and\r\nyouth who are our future and to families, we want\r\nto offer special attention and care to orphans and\r\nto child-headed households\".\r\nAllow me in conclusion to thank all the conveners\r\nwho have worked tirelessly to make this conference\r\na reality, those who assisted materially and\r\ntechnically', African Jesu'lt Network (AJAN), Catholic\r\nRelief Services (CRS), Trocaire, GTZ amongst\r\nothers.\r\nIt is with their partnership and collaboration\r\nthat we are able to make real our mission to\r\nrespond with love to those infected and affected by\r\nHIV&AIDS\r\nLet us learn to encourage\r\nI.\r\nFourteen year old Priscilla Maitha is benefiting from the\r\nOrphans and Vulnerable Children project implemented by\r\nth-e Archdiocese of Mombasa. The second born in a family\r\nof three girls, Priscilla lost both parents six years ago and\r\nwas left under the care of an uncle whose wife did not like\r\nPricilla and her two siblings.\r\nUnwanted by her relatives and with no home, Priscilla\r\nand her siblings went to Samba Catholic Church where with\r\nthe help of the parish management committee, they were\r\nassessed and recruited to the avc p'roject for support.\r\nA village community health worker volunteered to offer\r\nshelter to the children for a short period while the project\r\nintervened to get a willing relative who could offer shelter\r\nand care.\r\nMessage from Rt.
