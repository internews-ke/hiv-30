{"text": "DAILY NATION Monday June 4, 2007\r\n\r\nCONSTITUTION\r\n\r\nJudge disqualified from case\r\non HIV positive employee\r\n\r\nOn the question of a judge to disqualify himself\r\non grounds of bias, the issue to consider is not\r\nthe mind of the particular jUdge. Rather, it is\r\nthe ilnpression given to other people. Even if\r\nthe judge was as impartial as could possibly\r\nbe, if right-minded people would think the circumstances\r\nwere such\r\nhood of bias on his part, then the judge should\r\nnot:-rS Ltd,'Dr Primus Ochieng and MetropoH\"\r\nI1 Health ,\r\ntest on her and disclosing her status to Homepark andJnuch more.\r\nwithout her prior, informed consent. w~.kenyalillN,oxg\r\nShe also asked the court to declare that she outlook@nation.co.ke\r\nwas entitled to reinstatement as an employee of _~l:Imin@!tenyalaw.org\r\nHomepark and to compensation.\r\nSave for certain interlocutory matters that\r\narose, the hearing of the case was presided over\r\nby Justice J.B Ojwang. Jasmine was represented\r\nbyMr Otiende Amolo,\r\nPreviously, in 2001, the Attorney-General had\r\nappoiuted a National Thsk Force on HIV-Aids to\r\ngive opinion, fonnulate policies and guidelines\r\nand make recommendations on legal issues relatiug\r\nto HIV and Aids.\r\nThe Task Forces' work culminated in a report\r\ncontaining recommendations on legal and policy\r\nissues' on' HIV and Aids. The report led to the\r\npassing ofthe HIVaud Aids Prevention and Control\r\nAct, 2006, Act No 14, which had uot yet.been\r\nbrought into effect.\r\nAdvocate ArnoUo and a Ms Catherine Mumma,\r\none of the principal witnesses in the suit, had\r\nbeen joint secretaries to the Task Force. Also, Justice\r\nOjwang had been one of the consUltants for\r\nthe Task Force. He had repOltedly shared a forum\r\nof the 'l'JBk Force with both Mr Amollo and Ms\r\nMumma, where he had presented a paper on HIVAids.\r\nHe was said to have publicly supported the\r\ncause of the Task Force.\r\nBoth the report of the Thsk Force and the Act\r\ntouch on issues of Aids vis a vis the light to privacy\r\nand confidentiality, the workplace, human\r\nlights and use of language sensitive to HIV and\r\nAids issues.\r\n- 'l c the hearing of the case was pending\r\n\"\"wang, Homepark brought this\r\n\r\npetitionin-th@ COHstitHtioaaJ Court, Giting-s@{}tions\r\n70, 77(9) and (10), 84(1) ofthe Constitution,\r\nHomepark's advocate argued that considering\r\nthe similarity between the issues which Justice\r\nOjwang was required to decide in the case and the\r\nrecommendations of the Task Force, of which he\r\nhad been a consUltant, the judge may have a bias\r\nto certain positions or inclinations that the Task\r\nForce dealt with,\r\nHomeparkfelt that it would not get a fair hear~\r\ning. It feared\ufffd that because there was no law in\r\nforce governing HIVand Aids, the judge was likely\r\nto determine the case basedon his own perception\r\nofissues, since his mind mayalreadyhave the\r\npredisposition of a consultant ofthe Task Force.\r\nHomepark asked the Constitutional Court to\r\ndeclare that trial of the case by Justice Ojwang\r\namounted to an infringement of its lights. It also\r\nsought an order that the case should proceed before\r\na different judge of the High Court.\r\nHomepark said;that proceedings presided by\r\nJustice Ojwangwere unlikely to satisfy the test,of\r\nan independent and impartial court provided for\r\nin section 77 ofthe Constitution.\r\nThe petition was opposed on several grounds\r\nand on a preliminary objection. Among these\r\ngrounds were the arguments that Constitutional\r\nCourt judges had no jurisdiction to supervise\r\nanother jndge of the High Court and that\r\nHomepark, being a company rather than a nahlral\r\nperson, had wrongly invoked a procedure re-\r\nserved to individuals.\r\nIn their unanimous opinion delivered on May\r\n25,2007, Justices J,G Nyamu and R Wendoh first\r\ndisposed ofthe procedural issues. Regardingtheir\r\njurisdiction to hear the petition, they observed\r\nthat the special judsdictiou vested in the High\r\nCourt under section 84ofthe Constitution waS an\r\noriginal'bneto protect fundamental rights.Itwas,\r\ntherefore; a special jurisdiction which is binding\r\non all organs of the government.\r\nOn the standing of Homepark to file the petition,\r\nthe judges noted that the definition of a\r\n\"person\" under section 123 of the Constitution\r\nincluded incorporated. and un\".incorporated.associations.\r\nSuch entities inay articulate their fundamen~\r\nrights in Court, proVided the contravention\r\nforwhich they have filed the proceedings is\r\ninreljl,tiqn t() them.\r\n. .' While a company woUld not be able to iuvok~\r\nthe right to liberty, because the light cannot: be\r\neffectively and naturally attached to a c:orporate\r\nbody, it can assert its right to afairhearing before\r\nanindep~ndenttribunal: '-'\" '.':\r\nTherefore, Homeparkwas,nottc{be prevented\r\nfrom seeking the remedies iteIairn,ed merely' oil\r\naccount of it being a corporate body.\", :':\r\nThe judges then summaiised thelit41~stestt9\r\nbe applied on the main question ofthe:,sllitability\r\nof Justice Ojwang to preside over thecase: ili\r\nconsideling whether there was a real likelihood\r\nofbias, the comt does not look at the mind of the\r\npalticular judge.\r\nIt does not look to see'ifthere was a reallikelihood\r\nthat the judge would favour one side at the\r\nexpense of the other~TPecourt looks at the impression\r\nwhich would be given to other people.\r\nEven if the judge was as impartial as could be,\r\nif right-minded people would think that the circumstances\r\nwere such that there was a reallikea\r\nlihood of bias, then the jndge should not preside\r\nover the case.\r\nThe judges found out that the issues which\r\nwere before Justice Ojwang were substantially\r\nthe matters reflected or contained in the report\r\nof the Task Force and the HIV Aids Prevention\r\nand Control Act. The judge's role as a consultant\r\nand the alleged public expression of opinion, as\r\nwell as the sharing of a platfonn byoue ofthe advocates\r\nand the plincipal witness for the plaintiff,\r\ndid in fact, whether tightly or wrongly, identify\r\nhim with the Task Force's repolt.\r\nThis made him unfit to continue with the hearing.\r\nWhere there isreasonable or apparent appre~\r\nhension of danger ofbias, a COUlt would not satisfy\r\nthe requirements of independence and impar~\r\ntiality under section 77(9) of the Constitution,\r\nAccordingly, Justices Nyamu and Wendoh\r\ngranted the declarations and orders sought by\r\nHomepark and ordered that the case file before\r\nJnstice Qjwang shouldbe transmitted to the Chief\r\nJustice for reallocation to another judge.\r\n\r\nReported by Michael Murungi"}
