"Narc has strengthened control
of HlV/Aids and we believe that
these funds will help many prograrrunes

decreased from 85,000 to 60,000
in the past one year, Dr Erasmus
Morah, UNAids country co-ordina·
tor, said prevention should still be
emphasised.
"Most patients now have access
to treatment and Kenya needs
to increase its talk about the disease,"
said Morall.
Of the 2.4 million children orphaned
yearly, .50 per cent are
through Aids.

not only the youth, to 'abstain from
any behaviour that puts us at risk
to HIV infection."

on the gains and safeguard against
complacency.

has maintained its tough stance
on condoms even as the Anglicans
partly allowed their use.

Bishup Alfred Rotich, said the
Church would lalIDch an, anti-condom
campaign.

ment that use of condoms would
encourage promiscuity, especially
among the youth.
"Abstinence is what we are advocating-
for among the youth. Sex
is meant for those who have been
joined in matrimony," he said.
EveiLdiscordant couples, he said,
should avoid sex.

its scope in public education

their situation.
