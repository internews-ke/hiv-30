{"text": "SATURDAY NATION June 9, 2007\r\n\r\nKenyans bury their heads in the sand\r\nDespite law against\r\nabortion and outrage\r\nby religious leaders\r\nand moralists, lots\r\nofwomen continue\r\nto risk their lives\r\nto end unwanted\r\npregnancies, writes\r\n\r\nBY MILDRED NGESA\r\n\r\nEvery day, Wardill of Kenyatta National\r\nHospital receives between\r\nsix and eight cases of botched\r\nabortions.\r\nIn a month, the ward deals with an\r\naverage of 250 cases of failed abortions\r\ninvolving women who are rushed to the\r\nhospital after attempts to end pregnancies\r\nbackfire.\r\nThe national statistics are more startling.\r\nAbout 316,560 abortions occur in the\r\ncountry annually. Out of these, an esti~\r\nmated 20,893 women are hospitalised\r\nwith abortion-related complications.\r\nDespite general outrage over the practice,\r\nthousands of women in the country\r\nstill risk their lives to end unplanned or\r\nunwanted pregnancies.\r\nAccording to a recent report by Ipas,\r\nan international reproductive health organisation\r\nworking in conjunction with\r\nthe Ministry of Health, Kenya Medical\r\nAssociation and Fida-Kenya, abortion is\r\nincreasingly becoming a major challenge\r\nto the provision of reproductive health\r\nservices.\r\nReligious leaders\r\nAlthough religions leaders and moralists\r\nhave condemned the act, it continues with\r\nhnpunity.\r\n\"It is a problem that cannot be wished\r\naway. No matterhow much public outcry\r\nthere is against abortion, the fact is that\r\nmanywomen continue procuring it in the\r\nbackstreets andwe areleftto clean-up the\r\nmess of quacks which most of the time\r\nmaybe too late;' says ProfJoseph Karanja,\r\nan obstetrician gynaecologistandlecturer\r\nat the University ofNalrobi.\r\nProf Karanja asks Kenyans to stop burying\r\ntheir heads in the sand and squarely\r\nface the preval!iug \"abortion crisis~\r\n''We should deal with the issue of abortion\r\nthe same way we are dealing with\r\nHIV/Aids.\r\nNecessarymechanisms\r\n''In the beginningAids was highly stigmatised.\r\nBut now people are talking about\r\nit opeuly and the necessary mechanisms\r\nhave been put in place.\r\n''We have seen a change.Whythen can't\r\nwe rise above the stigma on abortion in\r\nthe same way?\" asked the lecturer.\r\n'~ortion affects all in society includeng\r\nthe rich, poor, educated, youug, old\r\nand even the clergy. We should have a\r\nsober approach on this issue:'\r\nRecentlY, Health assistant minister\r\nEnoch Kibunguchy, himself a gynaecologist,\r\ndeclared having safely procured abortions\r\nand called for sanity in the abortion\r\ndebate.\r\n\"I told a forum of gynaecologists in\r\nNyeri recently that as a doctor, I have\r\nperformed abortions and so have manyof\r\nthe doctors in attendance. I said 'may the\r\nfirst innocent doctor who has not done it\r\ncastthe first stone' and they concurredbecanse\r\nthey understandhow desperate the\r\nsituation is. It is time that we looked at\r\nabortion soberly;' sald Dr Kibungnchy.\r\nThe high cost of contraceptives and\r\npoor access fuelled by religious leaders'\r\ncondemnation of their use, has left many\r\nsexually-active women in a dilemma on\r\nhowto deal with unwanted pregnancies.\r\nMore children\r\nContrary to popular beliefthat it is mainly\r\nyouug school-going girls who procure\r\nabortion, statistics reveal that older\r\nwomen - including mamed ones - often\r\nfind themselves with unplanned pregnancies\r\nand engage in the practice.\r\nThey include those whose husbands\r\nno longer need more children and older\r\nwomen presumably past child-bearing\r\nage who could \"embarrass\" their families\r\nwith a pregnancies.\r\nMothers in rural areas who cannot access\r\nor afford contraception find themselves\r\nin the Same dilemma.\r\nIn Kenya, abortion is legally restricted\r\nto cases where a woman's life is considered\r\nto be in danger due to pregnancy.\r\nThe law criminalises anybody who\r\nprocures an abortion in unsafe circumstances.\r\nHowever, under the Health ministry,\r\nthe law allows post-abortion care services\r\nfor women who have developed complications\r\nwhile trying to tenninate a pregnancy.\r\nStudies conducted in various district\r\nhospitals in the country reveal increasing\r\ndesperation amongwomenwho often use\r\ncrude tools to procure abortions.\r\nSome cases result in the removal of\r\nuteruses, blockage of fallopian tubes or\r\nsevere haemorrhage, and death.\r\n''When awomanis desperate to procure\r\nan abortion, she will not care about the\r\nqualifications of the personwho offers to\r\nperlorm it or even consider the fact that\r\nshe might lose her life in the process.\r\n''That is how desperate women are in\r\nthis situation;' says Dr Solomon Orero, a\r\ngynaecologist based in Southern Sudan.\r\nAccording to a 2006 survey on unsafe\r\nabortions bythe Population Reference Bureau,\r\nan estimated 46 million abortions\r\nare performed yearly worldwide\r\nOfthese, 19 million are procured in unsafe\r\nconditions by people who lack the\r\nnecessary skills.\r\nDevelopingworld\r\nThe report also states that 529,000 girls\r\nand women die from pregnancy-related\r\ncomplications each year, almost all of\r\nthem in the developing world.\r\nAbout 68,000 ofthese deaths are due to\r\nunsafe abortions.\r\nBut even more critical is the need for\r\naccessibility and aVailability of reproductive\r\nhealth services such as contraceptives\r\nto prevent unplanned pregnancies.\r\nThe Health ministry has also not come\r\nup a comprehensive reproductive health\r\nbudget.\r\n\"The reproductive health budget has\r\nbeen decimally low. More efforts need to\r\nbe put in this area if we are to save our\r\nwomen;' said Dr Kibunguchy.\r\nThe Global Gag Rule by the US on organisations\r\nthat fund reproductive health\r\nprojects has worsened the situation.
