{"text": "DAlLY NATION Friday July 6, 2007\r\n\r\nFemale condom use defended\r\n\r\nDevice is not easily\r\naccessed and women\r\ndo not know how to\r\nuse it, meeting told\r\n\r\nBy CAROLINE WAFULA\r\n\r\nDelegates at an international meeting\r\nhave dismissed claims that\r\nwomen do not like the female\r\ncondom.\r\nCriticism of the condom tended to be\r\nbased on the fact that few women in African\r\ncountries had access to it and not\r\nmany had been educated on its use, said\r\nthe delegates at the World Young Women\r\nChristianAssociation (YWCA) meeting in\r\nNairobi.\r\nThe executive director ofthe Joint Uuited\r\nNations Progranune on HIV and Aids\r\n(UNAids), Dr Peter Piot, called on donors\r\nand governments to increase investment\r\nin female-initiated methods of HN and\r\nAids prevention, citing the female condom\r\nand microbicides as some of those\r\nthat needed priority. The female condom\r\nmust be fully funded and research on microbicides\r\nboosted, Dr Piot said at the official\r\nopening of the YWCA International\r\nWomen's Summityesterday.\r\n\"We need to do better in terms of action\r\nthat is relevant for women;' he said.\r\nStatistics indicate that only one female\r\ncondom was available for every 100\r\nwomen ofreproductive age inAfrica, Asia\r\nand Latin America last year.\r\nReproductive health experts said research\r\nshowed that women would demand the condom as an HNprevention\r\nproduct if they had access to it and were\r\nshown howto use it.\r\nWomen raised concern on whether\ufffd it\r\nwas safe to use the female condom\ufffdmore\r\nthan once, due to its high cost.\r\nIt also emerged that the devicemayonly\r\nbe accessed bythe high and middle class,\r\nmostly in urban areas, shutting out those\r\nin rural areas and slums. '\r\nOrganisations such as the World Health\r\nOrganisation (WHO), the Uuited Nations\r\nPopulation Fund (UNFPA), Population\r\nServices International and Family Health\r\nInternational work closely with governments\r\nto provide the female condom in\r\nvarious countries at a reduced cost.\r\nLoose mora.ls\r\nUNAids senior women and Aids advocacy\r\nofficer PaulineMuchina said a positive\r\nimage of the female condom was key to\r\npromoting its acceptability.\r\n''Many women still don't know about\r\nthe condom because there has not been\r\nenough awareness on it,\" she said.\r\nThe issue of stigma also arose, with\r\nwomen saying they feared buying or carrying\r\ncondoms. Many shy away from asking\r\nfor it for fear of being branded prostitutes\r\nor of loose morals, according to observations\r\nraised by delegates.\r\nReducing costs\r\nWomen who took part in the discussions\r\nat Kenyatta International Conference\r\nCentre (DCC) said increased financial\r\ninvestment in female condoms by donors\r\nand governments would greatly bring\r\ndown the cost to affordable levels.\r\nAn official of the Female Health Company\r\nin London, which manufactures the\r\ncondom, said the firm expected to ship 25\r\nmillion condoms to various countries this\r\nyear, up from 20 million last year.\r\nMr Robbie Nelson said the number of\r\nfemale condoms the company manufactured\r\nyearly had risen by between 20 and\r\n40 per cent in the past four years.\r\nHe said the number was small, compared\r\nto six billion male condoms distributed\r\nevery year."}
