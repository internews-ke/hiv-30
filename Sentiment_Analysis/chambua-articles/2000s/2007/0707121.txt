{"text": "DAILY NATION Tuesday June 12, 2007\r\n\r\ndeclaration ofAids\r\nas a national disaster\r\nmarked a turning\r\npoint in war against\r\nthe disease in Kenya. The\r\nconntry had at last woken up\r\nto the impact of the scourge.\r\nHowever, more still needs\r\nto be done to help orphans\r\nand their gtlatdians overcome\r\npoverty.\r\nThe disease remains one\r\nof the biggest catastrophes to\r\nhavehithnmankind in the last\r\nthree decades.\r\nSub-Saharan Africa has been\r\nhardest hit with over 600 Aids\r\npatients said to be dying daily.\r\nMany countries in the region\r\nhave a prevalence rate of between\r\n10 and 12 per cent, and\r\nthe pinch of the impact of the\r\ndisease is felt in all the sectors\r\nofthe countries' economies.\r\nIiI these countries, the pandemichas\r\nimpactedheavilyon\r\norphans and their guardians.\r\nWith infection rates going np\r\nand more people succumbing\r\nto the disease, the number of\r\nAids orphans has been on the\r\nrise.\r\n'The sad reality is that the\r\nmajority ofthose who die from\r\nthe disease are young and energetic\r\nworkers who are also\r\nthe breadwinners ofthe families.\r\nAndwhen theydie, thejob\r\nofproviding for the families is\r\nleft to children, some in their\r\nteenage years.\r\n'The disease has also impact-\r\ned negatively on orphans and\r\nguardians as regards access\r\nto education and basic needs\r\nsuch as food, clothing and\r\nshelter. It has' also subjected\r\nthem to stigma and exposed\r\nthem to the vicions cycle of\r\npovelt)'.\r\nAccess to education will remain a mirage to most ofthese\r\nchildren. Even though the\r\ncountry aspires to have educationfor\r\nall by20l5, for orphans\r\nand vulnerable children this\r\nmight be a pipe dream.\r\nSince most are left nnder the\r\ncare ofold andpoor goardians\r\nstruggling to make ends meet,\r\nproviding basic needs like\r\nschool unifonn and food is a\r\ndifficult task\r\nMoreover, stigma has re-\r\n- mained a constant companion\r\nto orphans. Most-have to\r\nseek refuge in childten's home\r\nwhile the lucky few who get\r\nguardians may face other life\r\nchallenges. For some, engaging\r\nin menHU workfor upkeep\r\nis a illilly routine\r\nSuch children end up being\r\nexploited economically, physically,\r\nmorally and sometimes\r\nspiritually. Although there is\r\nlegislation covering them for\r\nexample the Children's Act,\r\nsuch laws are being flouted\r\nwith impunity."}
