{"text": "DAILY NATION Thursday June 14, 2007\r\n\r\nKenya in new blood transfusion procedure\r\n\r\nDogged by blood shortages\r\nsince the advent of HIV and\r\nHepatitis B, Kenya plans a\r\nnovel way to reduce wastage,\r\nwrites ISAIAH ESIPISU\r\n\r\nenya will soon move from transfusing\r\nwhole blood to transferring only the\r\nspecific component required by a pa:\r\nient, for example an anaemic person\r\nwill only get red blood cells while a cancer case\r\nwill be given plasma alone.\r\nIn a project that plans to cut blood wastage,\r\nit will also introduce smaller packs for children\r\nbecause at the moment the product is stored in\r\nuniform containers despite children requiring\r\nless blood - the remainder is usually thrown\r\naway. The Blood Safety Project will enhance the\r\ncountry's capacity to derive the various blood\r\ncomponents from the whole blood and store\r\nthem as separate products. The National Blood\r\nTransfusion Centre, says its director Dr Jack Nyamongo,\r\nhas the capacity to separate these blood\r\nproducts but the Project is working on further\r\nenhancing this capability to make blood products\r\nmore readily available.\r\nThe Blood Safety (MOTTAINAI) Project is\r\nan initiative of the, Ministry of Health through\r\nthe National Blood Transfusion Service in collaboration\r\nwith the Japan International Cooperation\r\nAgency. Mottainai is a Japanese word that\r\nembraces the spirit of not wasting resources. It\r\nwas introduced internationally by Nobel Laureate\r\nProfWangari Maathai. The three~year project\r\nwas incepted last year. It covers the National\r\nBlood Transfusion Service in Nairobi, the Regional\r\nBlood Transfusion Centre in Nakuru and three\r\nmodel hospitals: Nakuru Provincial General Hospital;\r\nKoibatek District Hospital and Naivasha\r\nDistrict Hospital.\r\nAccording to Mr Nick Tanui, the regional\r\ntechnical director and acting centre director of\r\nthe Nakuru Regional Blood Transfusion Centre,\r\nsome of the major problems facing hospital blood\r\nbanks when it comes to blood handling are lack of\r\nbasic infrastructure like refrigeration, Irregular\r\nelectricity supply, inadequate laboratory equipment\r\nand lack of proper logistics and inventory\r\nmanagement. To ease infrastructure problems,\r\nJICA, through this project will provide various\r\nequipment.\r\nTraining and sensitization on proper logistics\r\nand inventory management of blood is another\r\nkey component of the project. Ms Miyuki Tamura,\r\nthe project coordinator, emphasizes proper\r\nrecord keeping and inventory management as key\r\nin curbing blood wastage and also in ensuring\r\navailabiliry of safe blood.\r\nFor instance, applying the concept of First to\r\nExpire, First Out CFEFO) Ca distribution management\r\nsystem whereby blood with the earliest\r\nexpiration date is distributed first and blood with\r\nlater expiry dates are only distributed after the\r\nearlier-dated supplies have been issued) reduces\r\nthe amount of blood wasted due to expiry. The\r\nproject also seeks to improve management of the\r\nblood cold chain from the point of donation to the\r\npoint of transfusion.\r\nTo avoid wastage of blood in paediatric\r\ntransfusion cases, the project plans to introduce\r\nthe preparation of smaller packs for children\r\nalbeit on pilot basis. The necessary equipment\r\nfor preparation of these packs will be installed\r\nand training on preparation of the packs will be\r\ncarried out.\r\nThrough the Blood Safety Project four staff\r\nfrom the National and Nakuru Regional Blood\r\nTransfusion Centre have been trained in Japan\r\nProject to introduce smaller\r\npacks for children to reduce\r\nwastage ofblood products\r\non blood safety. More training will be conducted\r\nin the course of the project implementation. It\r\nis expected that the knowledge and skills gained\r\nwill be transferred to all those involved in the\r\nblood transfusion chain.\r\nThe average adult has about five liters of blood\r\nliving inside of their body, coursing through their\r\nvessels, delivering essential elements, and removing\r\nharmful wastes. Without blood, the human\r\nbody would stop working.\r\nBlood is the fluid of life, transporting oxygen\r\nfrom the lungs to body tissue and carbon dioxide\r\nfrom body tissue to the lungs. Blood is the fluid\r\nof growth, transporting nourishment from digestion\r\nand hormones from glands throughout the\r\nbody. Blood is the fluid of health, transporting\r\ndisease fighting substances to the tissue and\r\nwaste to the kidneys.\r\nBecause it contains living cells, blood is alive.\r\nRed blood cells and white blood cells are responsible\r\nfor nourishing and cleansing the body. Since\r\nthe cells are alive, they too need nourishment.\r\nVitamins and .Minerais keep the blood healthy.\r\nThe blood cells have a definite life cycle, just as\r\naU living organisms do.\r\nApproximately 55 per cent of blood is plasma,\r\na straw-colored clear liquid. The liquid plasma\r\ncarries the solid cells and the platelets which help\r\nblood clot. Without blood platelets, you would\r\nbleed to death.\r\nWhenthe human body loses a little bit ofblood\r\nthrough a minor wound, the platelets cause the\r\nblood to clot so that the bleeding stops. Because\r\nnew blood is always being made inside of your\r\nbones, the body can replace the lost blood. When\r\nthe human body loses a lot ofblood through a major\r\nwound, that blood has to be replaced through\r\na blood transfusion from other people.\r\nBut everybody's blood is not the same. There\r\nare four different blood types. Plus, the blood\r\nhas Rh factors which make it even more unique.\r\nBlood received through a transfusion must match\r\nyour own. Patients who are scheduled to have\r\nmajor surgery make autologous blood donations\r\nCdonations of their own blood) so that they have\r\na perfect match.\r\nInteresting blood cells and some of the special\r\nproteins blood contains can be replaced or sup~\r\nplemented by giving a person blood from someone\r\nelse. This process is called a transfusion. In\r\naddition to receiving whole blood transfusions,\r\npeople can also receive transfusions of a particular\r\ncomponent of blood that they need. For\r\nexample, someone can receive only platelets, red\r\nblood cells, or a clotting factor. When people donate\r\nblood, the whole blood can be separated into\r\nits different parts"}
