democracy says study
A sharp rise
"OUf findings have shown
there has been a sharp rise in
the number of elected leaders
that have died prematurely of
illJje~sp Kondwani Chirambo,
head of the governance and
AID$ programme at IDASA,
said at"a'recent conference in
Cape Thwn. "If yon compare
the trends before the onset
of the pandemic and after, we
do see that patterns of death
mimic the mortality pattern
of the general population;'
he said
Mr Chirambo's research
casts a new light on southern
Africa's HIV/Aids problem as
South Africa prepares for its
biannual AIDS conference
in Durban, which begins on
Thesday.
While the epidemic's toll in
human lives and medical expense
is well documented, the
study showed that HIV/Aids is
also responsible for political
power shifts and extra strain
on treasuries that have to organise
by-elections, IDASA
said.
