Despite the increasing availability ofAnti-retro viral
drugs (ARVs) in sub Saharan Africa, the continent's
traditional healers and their plant medicines are
playing an important role in the treatment of
some of the most dreadful HN and Aids-related
opportunistic infections and other ailments, writes

writes, Research conducted by The Uganda

In Uganda, there is atleast one traditional
healer for nearly 290 people compared to
oneWestern-trained medical practitioner
for every10,000 people in the urban areas
and 50,000 people in the rural areas.
lfaditional healers remain popular
because they are also accessible,
affordable, adaptable ,and culturally
familiar and thus acceptable, They are
also respected in the wider community
Africa's traditional healers can be most
instrumental inHNand Aids prevention,
For starters, these specialists treat most of
the cases ofSTDs and experts believe that
STDs are major co-factors in the spread

Africa is far behind China
and India where alternative medicine is
an integrated part of modern medicine
practised in hospitals. In fact, Chinese
traditional medicine accounts for about
40 per cent of all health care delivery,
In sub-Saharan Africa at least 80 per
cent of the people rely on traditional
healers. Their popularity is a result
of their availability, For example, in
Mozambique there is one physician for
every 50,000 people compared to one
traditional healer for every 200, Zambia,
with an estimated 20 to 25 per cent of
the population being HN-positive, has
only 900 Western educated doctors 600
of whom are foreign. However, she has
40,000 registered traditional healers for
population of 20 million.
AIDS Commission and the Joint Clinical
Research Centre \n Kampala has found
traditional medicine to be "better snited
to the treatment of some Aids symptoms
such as herpes-zoster (HZ), chronic
diarrhoea, shingles, and weight loss':
Uganda's Traditional and Modern
Health Practitioners Together against
AIDS (THETA) conducted controlled
clinical trials on a Ugandan herbal
treatment for herpes~zoster. Comparing
subjects on herbal treatment with
controls using acyclovir, the conventional
treatment for herpes zoster, both groups
were found to experience similar rates of
resolution ofHZ attacks, The traditional
medicine group had less super-infection
and showed less keloid formation than
did subjects on acyclovir. HZ pain
resolved significantly faster in the herbal
group,
Progress on using herbal medicines to
treat Aids is even beingmadein economic
basket-case Zimbabwe. For example, a
study conducted by the Blair Research
Institute Clinic in Harare evaluated
the impact traditional medicine in
HN-infected people and assessed their
quality oflife with respect to HNdisease
progression.
There were 105 HN-infected subjects
in the study, at various stages of HN
infection, of whom 79 per cent were on
traditional herbal medicine and 21 per
cent were on conventional medical care

Using the World Health Organisation's
