Anti-Aids campaigns ignore Sudan's poor

Agnes Buya, 66, lies in the infectious
diseases ward ofJuba Teaching Hospital
in soutbem Sudan. Painfully
tbin she has been suffering from TB
for the past year. "I came to the hospital
a few days ago; the family who
were caring for me couldn't look
after me any more," she said. '~
soon as I got here the doctor tested
me for HNand found me positive."
Worldwide, an estimated 2.8 million
people over the age of 50 are living
with HN, but this group is largely ig·
nared by infoITIlation and awareness
campaigns. Most people remain sexually
active well past their 50s, usually
with their long-term panners.
