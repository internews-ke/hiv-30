{"text": "DAILY NATION Thursday May 31, 2007\r\n\r\nMINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS\r\nKENYA PRISONS SERVICE HIV AND AIDS POLICY LAUNCH\r\nNAIVASHA MAXIMUM GK SECURITY PRISON\r\n\r\nMessage from the Vice President and\r\nMinister for Home Affairs\r\n\r\nThe launch of the Kenya Prisons Service\r\nHIV/AIDS policy is in the line with the\r\n, Government's policy sessional paper No.\r\n4 of 1997 which defined the institutional\r\nframework and intensified intervention measures\r\nfor the prevention, management, control and mitigation\r\nof the impact of HIV/AIDS.\r\nWhen HIV/AIDS was declared a National Disaster\r\nin November 1999, the Government developed the\r\nNational HJV/AIDS Strategic pIau 2000-2005 and\r\n2005/06-2009/2010 with an aim of reducing the\r\nspread of the pandemic. HIV/AIDS has impacted\r\nnegatively on society in many ways, for example, it\r\ndepletes and weakens the labour force, reduces productivity\r\nand household income, increases health\r\ncosts and other costs of living. This subsequently\r\nposes a challenge on National Development.\r\nUnder TOWA (Total War Against Aids) project, the\r\nGovernment and development partners have continued\r\nto put in place policies and infrastructure to\r\nhelp implement programmes at all levels and have\r\nissued guidelines for conducting activities in all\r\nHIV/AIDS related areas. It is on this basis that I en-\r\ncourage more development partners to come to our\r\naid in the area of ARVs (Antiretrovirals) provision\r\nto those who qualify for the same. Statistics show\r\nthat out of 350,000 people that are in need of ARVs,\r\nonly 135,000 are on the same. I take this opportune\r\ntime to thank Kijabe Aids Relief Consortium\r\nfor their initiative of starting an ARV programme at\r\nGK Prison Naivasha.\r\nThe Government through the Governance, Justice,\r\nLaw and Order Sector (GJLOS) reform programme\r\nand NACC (National Aids Control Council), established\r\n2005-2009 medium term strategy (MTS) to\r\nmainstream four cross cutting issues namely, Gender,\r\nChildren, HIV/AIDS and Environment.\r\nI am glad that Prisons Department in its efforts to\r\ncurb the spread of HIV/AIDS has come up with a\r\npolicy to cater for its large clientele. This 1am convinced\r\n\\Vill cater for issues affecting prisoners, staff,\r\ntheir families and host communities where prisons\r\nare situated throughout the country. In addition, the\r\ndepartment with the help of development partners\r\nsuch as Centres for Disease Control and Prevention,\r\nAMREF Kenya, Constella Futures and UNODC have\r\ncarried out a number of activities that facilitated\r\nthe training of VCT Counselors, Behaviour Change\r\nCommunication, Educators, Health Care Providers\r\nin HIV/TB/STI management, PMTCT (Prevention of\r\nMother to Child Transmission) besides establishing\r\nVCT Centres and conducting mobile VCT outreaches\r\nhence increasing access to VCT uptake.\r\nMay I now take this opportunity to thank all development\r\npartners present for their immense contribution\r\ntowards the HIV/AIDS Programme in Prisons\r\nDepartment and by extension to the Ministry\r\nof Home Affairs. In spite of the challenges that the\r\nDepartment is struggling with, you found opportunity\r\nand commitment to implement the programme\r\nwith prisons. 1 also challenge more organizations\r\nand development partners to partner with prisons\r\nDepartment not only in HIV/AIDS but also in other\r\nspheres ofinfluence.\r\n\r\nTHE MESSAGE FROM THE PERMANENT SECRETARY\r\nThe Kenya Government\r\nthrough Sessional Paper\r\nNo. 4 of 1997, defined\r\nthe institutional framework\r\nand intensified intervention\r\nmeasures for the prevention, man~\r\nagement, control and mitigation of\r\nthe impact of HIV and Aids. HIV\r\nand Aids was declared a national\r\ndisaster on 25th November 1999.\r\nIt has mostly affected people between\r\n15 and 49 years who form\r\nthe bulk of the workers. The Ministry\r\nof Home Affairs has not been\r\nspared either.\r\nConsequently, the Kenya Government\r\nNational Aids Control Council\r\ndeveloped the National HIV and\r\nAids Strategic Plan 2005-2010 with\r\nthe aim of reducing the spread of\r\nHN, improving the quality of life\r\nof those infected and affected, mitigating\r\nthe socio-economic impact\r\nof HIV and Aids and effectively\r\nmanaging and co-ordinating HIV\r\nand Aids programme activities.\r\nTo effectively fight HIV and Aids,\r\nintervention activities have been\r\ndeveloped for mainstreaming in\r\nthe core functions of government\r\ninstitutions. In response to the\r\ngovernment efforts to mitigate the\r\nimpact of HIV and Aids, the Directorate\r\nof Personnel Management\r\ndeveloped a public sector workplace\r\npolicy on HIV and Aids to facilitate\r\nthe implementation of the\r\nNational Strategic Plan. It provides\r\na framework to guide the government\r\nsectors and departments in\r\nformulating sector specific workplace\r\npolicies.\r\nIt is on this basis that Kenya Prisons\r\nService, a department of the\r\nMinistry of Home Affairs, has\r\nveloped this HIV and Aids policy.\r\nThe policy contributes towards the\r\nnational goals as set in the Kenya\r\nNational HJV and Aids Strategic\r\nPlan 2005-2010. Specifically, the\r\npolicy addresses HIV and Aids issues\r\naffecting prisoners, prison\r\nstaff, their families and the surrounding\r\ncommunities. It outlines\r\ntheir rights, responsibilities, and\r\nexpected behaviour as concerns\r\nHIV and Aids. It covers key principles\r\nsuch as the recognition of\r\nHIV and Aids as a workplace issue,\r\nnon-discrimination, screening and\r\nconfidentiality, gender responsiveness,\r\nsocial dialogue, prevention,\r\ncare and support as the basis of\r\naddressing HIV and Aids in the\r\nDepartment.\r\nThe implementation of this policy\r\nwill scale up the prevention,\r\ncare and support and mitigation of\r\nthe impact among the target group\r\nand therefore contribute towards\r\nthe national efforts to fight HIV\r\nand Aids.\r\n\r\nWORD FROM THE COMMISSIONER OF PRISONS\r\nhe development of this\r\npolicy has been neces.\r\nsitated by the challenges\r\nposed by HIV and\r\nAids in Kenya Prisons Service.\r\nHIV and Aids disproportionately\r\naffect people aged between 15 and\r\n49 years, a group which forms\r\nthe majority of prison staff. The\r\nillness and subsequent deaths of\r\nprison staff is making it difficult\r\nfor the Department to achieve its\r\ncore functions. Equally affected\r\nare the achievement of our vision\r\nand mission of being a correctional\r\nservice of excellence in\r\nAfrica and beyond and containing\r\noffenders in humane and safe\r\nconditions in order to facilitate\r\nresponsive administration of justice,\r\nrehabilitation, social re-integration,\r\nand community protection\r\nrespectively_\r\nThe impact on the prisoners is\r\nworse given their vulnerability\r\nsince they live within limited\r\nfreedoms. Further, of concern are\r\ncommunities surrounding prison\r\ninstitutions that interact with the\r\nprison community through interdependence.\r\nThe policy aims at mitigating\r\nTHE impact of HIV and Aids on\r\nthe aforementioned groups with\r\nthe ultimate purpose of contributing\r\ntowards the national efforts in\r\nthe fight to reduce the prevalence.\r\nIt will be a handy reference to\r\ntackle the challenges brought into\r\nthe Department by the effects of\r\nHIV and Aids, guiding each institution\r\nin developing programmes\r\nto facilitate effective and planned\r\nresponse to the management and\r\nprevetion of HIV and Aids in prisons.\r\nThe policy is a re-affirmation of\r\nthe Department's commitment\r\nto intensify its campaign against\r\nthe spread of HIV and ensure a\r\nharmonized response in the serv~\r\nice. Finally, I wish to appreciate\r\nthe important role played by all\r\nstakeholders involved in the policy\r\ndevelopment process."}
