{"text": "NATION WEDNESDAY JUNE 6, 2007\r\n\r\nLIVING POSITIVELY\r\nTHE VERY REAL FEAR OF DEATH\r\n\r\nWhy it is important to make use of the\r\ntime we have with our loved ones instead\r\nof waiting for signs of trouble to start\r\nmaking frenzied telephone calls\r\n\r\nYOU would be forgiven for thinking\r\nthat death doesn't scare me one bit,\r\nhaving lived with HIV for almost 20\r\n- years now.

But, just like that per\r\n;SOfl said after 9/11, by doing that I would\r\n.:h\ufffdve been ac ard refusing to go on\r\n. with life bec\ufffduse of irrational fears.\r\nI\ufffdm not saying we should tun blindly\r\ninto d\ufffdiige\ufffdb\ufffdt theV\ufffd is a Uilterence\r\nbetwe\ufffdn somethiiig that\ufffds real and some\r\nthing that\ufffds perceived, especially if the\r\nlatter is borA ou tot phobia. ..\r\nIn th\ufffd s\ufffdma w\ufffdy, sorneof us refuse to\r\nget on with Cur lives because a terrorist\r\ncalled +11V has stolen our immunity and"}
