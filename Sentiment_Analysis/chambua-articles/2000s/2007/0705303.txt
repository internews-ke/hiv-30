{"text": "NATION MAY 30, 2007\r\n\r\n\r\nTrusting the process\r\nA positive result may seem like the end of\r\nthe world but if you take it one step at a\r\ntime, you'll soon realise that it isn't\r\n\r\nIf there's one thing I remember-clearly\r\nabout the day I tested HIV-positive\r\nalmost 20 years ago, it is the darkness\r\nthat engulfed my life, And for the endless\r\ndays that followed, the doom and\r\ngloom mentality controlled my powers of\r\nspeech and perception.\r\nEven now. this seems to be a sort of\r\nnatural progression that everyone who\r\ntests HIV-positive must wade through,\r\nI'm yet to meet someone who came out\r\nof a voluntary counselling and testing\r\n(VCT) centre with a positiveKesult in one\r\nhand and an \"I have a firm grip on this\"\r\nattitude in the other. I don't know for\r\nsure, but I guess even VCT personnel are\r\nat their wits' end when confronted with\r\ntheir own positive status.\r\nSad and shocking\r\nBut I have realised that even with something\r\nas sad and shocking as a positive\r\nresult, there is a gradual and systematic\r\nprocess. It reminds me of the story of\r\ncreation in which God gradually separated\r\ndarkness from light and moved on\r\nthrough the days until the earth had form\r\nand life,\r\nWhen we first step out of a VeT room,\r\nour world is usually dark, And this dark\r\ndisposjtion usually tovers everything\r\nwe've ever dreamed of. At that moment,\r\n,qllr <w~enc,!~asn~llItM>rform htir.Jife,\r\nWe wobble around like zombies. This\r\ndarkness can represent our ignorance,\r\nfear, denial and anger at our present situation.\r\nAnd that's all the more reason why\r\nwe should strive to shift it.\r\nBlinding experience\r\nThe act of seeing the light can be a. blinding\r\nexperience, but if our lives have to\r\ntake on a particular form after a positive'result,\r\nthen we 'must have that courage\r\nthat comes from God to speak the powerful\r\nwords: \"let there be light\", \"let there\r\nbe hope\", \"let there be no fear\", \"Iet;there\r\nbe life\"...\r\nI always tell people that positive living\r\nis not\ufffdautomatic. I didn't wake up one fine\r\nmorning and realise that I was thinking\r\npositively. No. You have to get with the\r\nprogramme, which involves keeping on\r\nwalking and talking (sometimes with cold\r\nfeet or high hopes) and even crawling\r\nafter we've fallen flat on ourfaces.\r\nLike marriage\r\nJust like marriage, being HIV-positive is a\r\nrelationship, albeit a parasitic one. And although\r\nwe hold the short end of the stick\r\nin this particular relationship, it's incumbent\r\non us to graduate from day one all\r\nthrough to day seven if we want to enjoy\r\nsome semblance of rest. One thing is for\r\nsure; this virus will never give anyone rest\r\non a silver platter. It must be earned.\r\nI admit one thing: most people who\r\nstep out of a veT centre with a positive\r\ntest result lack a helping hand to guide\r\nthem across the chasm that suddenly\r\nopens up ahead of them.\r\n\"I walked aimlessly through the streets\r\nof Nairobi till dusk and later walked all\r\nthe way home,\" a friend once told me.\r\nShe was in such a state of shock over her\r\nHIV-positive result that she forgot she\r\nhad parked her car right outside the VCT\r\ncentre!\r\nThree core steps\r\nWhen asked about the three co're steps\r\none could ,~aketo make life. petter, mo\ufffd.\r\nJtivational speaker, lyan)a Vanzant, an-.\ufffd\r\nswered that the third step was to \"trust\r\nthe process of your life as it unfolds\r\nmoment to mom,ent, day to day, week to\r\nweek\".\r\nAs you step trembling out of that VCT,\r\ntrust the process even though at that\r\nparticular moment, you don't understand\r\na thing, After all, this is only the first day,\r\nAs more time goes by, there will be light\r\n'and insight.\r\nasuntawagura@hotmail.com\r\nThis is the diary of Asunta Wagura, a\r\nmother oftwo who tested positive 19\r\nyears ago.
