BEST WEAPON IN FIGHTING HIV AND AIDS 

I agree with the sentiments of
the ModernWoman article in
Lifestyle magazine last Sunday
that we should empower
the youth with information to
enablethem handle the HlY/
Aids crisis. KnoWledge is by
far the best weapon for young
people to tackle sexually
transmitted diseases, teenage
pregnancies and rising abortion.
Whatgood is there in
givingyo econdoms
when theyh derstand
sexuality and sex.
