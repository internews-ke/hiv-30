She is teaching them\r\nbasic Aids awareness and prevention.\r\nMany of the healers once believedHN\r\nwas a curse from the spirit world and patients\r\nhad been bewitched. Some claimed\r\nthey could cure Aids - and manywhohave\r\nnot been trained continue to claim this.\r\nBut while they still prescribe roots and\r\nherbs for ailments and mutter incanta-'\r\ntions to dispel evil spirits, these sangomas\r\nnow also issue condoms, refer patients to\r\nclinics forHNtests and urge them to take\r\nlife-prolonging anti-retroviral drugs.\r\n\"Before, I didn't even know what this\r\nHIV animal was, but the training has\r\nbrought sophistication to my work,\" said\r\nMiriam Tembe, who has been consulting\r\nthe spirits fOI'tips on treating patients for\r\n25 years.\r\nThe training helped her with the practice\r\nof scarring a patient then rubbing\r\nherbs or powder into the wound: \"I used\r\nto use one razor for five people - I used to\r\nkill people;' she added. ''Now I teach them\r\nhow to protect themselves:'\r\nThe project linking traditional practioners\r\nwith modern health systems is\r\nbeing run by African Medical and Research\r\nFoundation (AMREF), which says\r\nmore than two-thirds of people in rural\r\nAfrica consult sangomas before attend~\r\ning a clinic.\r\nSangomas are revered and trusted in\r\nrural communities and play multiple\r\nroles as spiritual guide, healer and counsellor.\r\nMostlybut not always woman, they\r\nmight offer tips to a young couple on their\r\nsex life, advise on proper burial rites, or\r\nconcoct a treatment for toothache - all\r\nin a day.\r\nAMREF wants sangomas to keep providing\r\nspiritual succour and basic healthcare,\r\nand also to use their influence and\r\nauthority to promote HIV-testing and\r\nmodern medicine in areas where many\r\npeople are distrustful of hospitals, clinics\r\nand ARV drugs.\r\n\"Traditional healers are so important\r\nin these communities. People trust them\r\nmore than they trust us nurses;' said Ivy\r\nMdletshe, a nurse whoworks in AMREF's\r\nHN testing centre. Zandile Bnkhosini\r\nhas benefited from the system. When her\r\nfeet swelled up and she developed a hacking\r\ncough she assumed she had been bewitched\r\nand went straight to see Tembe\r\n- her local sangoma. Fortunately, Tembe\r\nknewhowto spot the symptoms oftuberculosis,\r\nwhich often accompanies HIVinfection.\r\nShe consulted the spirit world as\r\nusual, then sent Bnkhosini for anHNtest.\r\nThe results were positive.\r\n\"When Miriam sent me for a test I was\r\nsceptical, but her medicine hadhelped me\r\nbefore so I decided to trust her;' said the\r\n25-year-old., hunched inside a mud and\r\nstraw hut, the bitter aroma ofburning incense\r\nwafting from the corner.\r\nNoW; With Tembe's support, Bukhosini\r\nis taking anti-retroviral drugs and looks\r\nhappy and healthy.\r\n\"Miriam encouraged me to take the\r\nmedicine the doctors gave me;' she said.\r\n\"But she also gives me her own treatment\r\nand tells me if I need to slaughter a chicken\r\nto appease the ancestors:'\r\nThe AMREF project has particular\r\nresonance in South Africa, where Health\r\nMinister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang has\r\nangered Aids activists by appearing to\r\nquestion accepted science and emphasising\r\ntreatments such as lemon, garlic and\r\nthe African potato.\r\nMs Ngwenya insists the two approaches\r\nare not mutually exclusive, and argues\r\nsangomas can help treat some of the side\r\neffects ofHN- such as skin problems or\r\ncoughs and colds c aud break down the\r\nstigma attached to it.\r\n\"Obviously there is not a traditional\r\nhealer who can cure Aids but they can\r\nhelp treat the symptoms and help support\r\npatients by giving them what they\r\nwant to believe;' she said.\r\nBut she also says much more must be\r\ndone. An esthnated 200,000 traditional\r\nhealers are practising in South Mrica\r\n- there are almost 900 in this small district\r\nof some 200,000 people - and organisations\r\nlikeAMREFhave trained just\r\na handful.\r\nManyhealers still tell patients anti-retroviral\r\ndrugs are toxic, condoms are infested\r\nwith disease-carrying worms and\r\nkilling a goat will appease ancestral\r\nspirits and cure the sick And while\r\na few weeks of basic training can\r\nhalt dangerous practices like razorsharing,\r\nhealers may continue to\r\npromote traditional methods over\r\nmodern medicine.\r\nBut most sangomas see little conflict\r\nbetween the two approaches,\r\nand say learning about orthodox\r\nhealthcare has helped improve their\r\ntraditional practice. \"How can the\r\nancestors be angry with me?\" said\r\nsangoma Phillle Gumbi when asked\r\nwhat the spirits thought when she\r\nencouraged patients to turn to modern\r\nmedicine: \"Both me and the hospitals\r\nare doing the same thing - we\r\nare saving lives:' (Reuters)"}
