{"text": "DAILY NATION Monday May 28, 2007\r\nVIOLENCE ON CHILDREN\r\n\r\nUN study indicts fathers over incest\r\n\r\nBy LUCAS BARASA\r\nSeventy five per cent of incest in\r\nKenya's urban areas are by the\r\nfather, a UN study on violence\r\nagainst children says.\r\nUncles and other relatives, the report to\r\nbe launched today atthe UNheadquarters\r\nin Gigiri says, account for 23 per cent of\r\nthe cases. It said 83 per cent of abuse oc\"\r\ncurred in the child's home.\r\nIn an interview in Nairobi, Prof Paulo\r\nSergio Pinheiro, who is the UN secretary\r\ngeneral's independent expert for the\r\nstudy, said violence against children had\r\nbeen increasing at an alarming rate.\r\nThe violence, he said, is aggravated by\r\nsilence, poverty, HN and Aids, bad distribution\r\nof resources and non-access to\r\nschools.\r\nHazardous work\r\nWorldwide, the report said 150 million\r\ngirls and 73 million boys experienced\r\nforced sexual intercourse or other forms\r\nof sexual violence in 2002.\r\nIn 2004, 126 million children were involved\r\nin hazardous work.\r\n\"Children' continue to fear and experience\r\nviolence in every country of the\r\nworld. Violence cuts across all social,\r\nreligious and ethnic lines,\" he said.\r\nDespite banning of corporal punishment\r\nin Kenyan schools in 2001, the\r\nstudy shows that children were still suffering\r\nfrom bruises, swellings, cuts, broken\r\nbones, hearing loss, knocked out teeth,\r\nand even death. The report said that eight\r\nper cent ofall sexual abuse cases were perpetrated\r\nby teachers. It added that Kenya\r\nhad between 10 to 30,000 child sex workers,\r\nmainly in tourist areas.\r\n'0\\ study of the extent and effect of sex\r\ntourism involving children on the Kenyan\r\nCoast reveals 75 per cent of key informants\r\n(underage girls involved in prostitution)\r\nfound the practice acceptable or\r\nactively approved of it. More than 45 per\r\ncent of those interviewed began transactional\r\nsex for cash, goods or favours between\r\nthe ages of 12 and 13 years;' the\r\nreport said.\r\nAccess to lawyers\r\nEighty five per cent of children in Kenya's\r\npolice custody or correctional care, it\r\nadded, had committedno offence while in\r\nUganda 70 per cent of children in conflict\r\nwith the law said their main reason for\r\nstealing was to meet basic needs.\r\nProf Pinheiro said children in custody\r\nshould be allowed access to lawyers and\r\nthose found engaging in prostitution han\"\r\ndled as victims instead of offenders.\r\nHe said the study was the first of its\r\nkind by the UN and that the numbers in\r\nit, which he said were just a tip oficeberg,\r\nare incredible. The expert said it was sad\r\nthat violence against children was perpetrated\r\nby those supposed to protect them\r\nincluding parents, relatives, neighbours,\r\nfriends and teachers.\r\nCalling for more awareness ofthe problem\r\nto fight it, Prof Pinheiro called on the\r\nmedia to deal with the problem in a \"serious\r\nand responsible manner.\"\r\n\"We must change acceptability of violence,\"\r\nhe said, adding that society should\r\nalso learn to listen to children's voices.\r\nThe official said governments should\r\nalso form independent bodies where\r\npeople could \"safely\" give information\r\non violence. Parliament and the Judiciary\r\nwere further asked to protect the rights\r\nof children.\r\nDifficulties in evaluating violence in\r\nfamilies, absence of research in some\r\ncountries and solving of problems before\r\nreaching the Judiciary, were some of the\r\nchallenges facing the fight against children\r\nviolence.\r\nUnited Nations Children Fund commu,\r\nnication officer Victor Chinyama said 12\r\nmillion children in eastern and southern\r\nAfri~ahad lost one or both parents due to\r\nHN and Aids. \"They have been taken in\r\nby extended families where they endure\r\nstigma and discrimination,\" Mr Chinyamasaid.\r\nHe called for stiffer penalties on those\r\ninvolved in violence against children and\r\ncommended a recent Zambiacourt ruling\r\nto sentence two people to 34 years in jail\r\nfor rape.\r\nProf Pinheiro and Mr Chinyama were\r\npleased that many cOWltries were making\r\npositive moves to curb children violence.\r\nIn Kenya, a recent initiative under the\r\nGovernance, Law and. Order Sector Reform\r\nis the construction ofholding facilities\r\nin selected police stations to ensure\r\nchildren are held separately from adults."}
