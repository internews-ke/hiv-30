It will work with\r\nvarious stakeholders including Ministry\r\nof Health, Ministry of Home\r\nAffairs, National AlDS Control Council,\r\nNational Agency for Campaign\r\nAgainst Drug Abuse and development\r\npartners.\r\nThe Department also intends to\r\nwork with development partners and\r\nstakeholders to establish Comprehensive\r\nCare Centres equipped with medical\r\nsu.pplies, appropriate equipment\r\nand trained personnel. In consultation\r\nwith the Medical Officer, efforts\r\nwill be made to provide nutritional\r\nsupplements, drugs for management\r\nof opportunistic infections and ARVs\r\nto prisoners and staff using National\r\nClinical Manual for ARV providers.\r\n\r\nPartnering to tame HIVIAIDS\r\nBy Evans Ongwae\r\n\r\nEven before developing its\r\nHIV and Aids policy, the\r\nthe Kenya Prisons Service has\r\npreviously grappled with the\r\ndisease.in various ways. Through a\r\nunique partnership with the AlC Kijabe\r\nHospital, the Department is providing\r\ncare to prisoners living with\r\nHN and Aids at the Naivasha Prison.\r\nIn this prison, HN patients account\r\nfor about 2.3 per cent of a population\r\nof more than 3,000 inmates.\r\nNegotiations between the two institutions\r\ncommenced in October last\r\nyear. An agreement based on government\r\npolicy and the Prisons Service's\r\npolicy was reached to provide comprehensive\r\ncare and ant-retroviral drugs\r\n(ARVs) within prison institutions, to\r\nlessen the security burden.\r\nIn the next two months AlC Kijabe\r\npersonnel started educating prison\r\nstaff on what HN care entails. This\r\nwas after identifying people who were\r\ninterested in providing HIV care.\r\nIn January this year the first 20 patients\r\nenrolled and thereafter more\r\ntook up ARV treatment. A seminar\r\nto prepare the patients for treatment\r\nwas held at the end of January and\r\nby February eight patients had been\r\nstarted on ARVs.\r\nA total of 70 patients have been enrolled\r\nin this programme with 36 of\r\nthem on ARVs and the rest on general\r\ncare.\r\nThere have been good developments\r\nwith 98 per cent of patients enrolled\r\nin care showing improvement in the\r\nform of increased weight gain or being\r\nless prone to attacks by opportunistic\r\ninfections.\r\nTreatment of opportuulstic infections\r\nand other diseases is done by the\r\nhospital medical staff in collaboration\r\nwith the prison personnel using antibiotics.\r\nLaboratory services are also offered\r\nto the patients. Hospital staff draw\r\nblood samples and take them to Kijabe\r\nfor CD4 cmIDt, liver function test,\r\nkidney function test and others.\r\nWorking hand in hand, the prison\r\nand the hospital staff have renovated\r\nthe pharmacy. at the Naivasha Prison\r\nto create one consultation and postpharmacy\r\nroom to facilitate dispensing\r\nofARVs.\r\nAlC Kijabe Hospital has also trained\r\nnine officers who help patients to adhere\r\nto ARV treatment.\r\nThe partnership between the Kenya\r\nPrison Service and the AlC Kijabe\r\nHospital has demonstrated that provision\r\nof health care to inmates is possible.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANCE OF THE POLICY\r\nThe Kenya Prisons Service Policy on\r\nHN and Aids provides the guiding\r\nprinciples and framework for scaling\r\nup responses in the Department. It\r\nforms the basis for the implementation of inter~\r\nventions relevant to the prisons community. The\r\npolicy addresses HN and Aids issues affecting\r\nprisoners, prison staff, their families and communities\r\nsurrounding prison institutions.\r\nThe Department like other sectors has borne\r\nthe brunt ofHNand Aids since the most affected\r\ngroup faUs vv1thin the economically productive,\r\nmobile and sexually active ages of 15~49 years.\r\nThe services have suffered due to the impact of\r\nHN and Aids which is manifested in reduced\r\nworkforce due to deaths, prolonged illness, absenteeism\r\nand low morale of affected workers\r\nand interruptions in their work schedules due to\r\nsocial commitments such as seeking medication.\r\nThe loss of human resource due to deaths leads\r\nto the government incurring increasing costs in\r\nrecruiting and training more officers to replace\r\nthose who die. The economic burden is even\r\nworsened by the increased expenses in care and\r\nsupport for infected prisoners.\r\nThe policy aims to address the impact caused\r\nby HN and Aids within prison institutions. It\r\nprovides guidance for those who deal with the\r\nday-to-dayHN and Aids related issues and problems\r\nthat arise within the prison setting and\r\noutlines the rights of prisoners and prison staff,\r\ntheir responsibilities and expected behaviour in\r\nthe prisons. It covers key areas such as legal and\r\nregulatory framework, gniding principles, human\r\nresources management of both HN infected and\r\naffected prisons staff and prisoners and HN and\r\nAids programmes in the prisons.\r\n\r\nRationale\r\nhiv and Aids present a great challenge\r\nto the Kenya Prisons Service\r\nwhich is losing manpower due to AlDS\r\nrelated deaths. The security of prisons\r\nis equally compromised due to absenteeism\r\nand physical weakness of officers\r\nsuffering from opportunistic infections.\r\nThere is also reduced performance due\r\nto ;stress and stigma associated vvith an\r\nHN positive status. The Department's\r\neconomic burden is increased by the\r\ncosts incurred in treating and caring\r\nfor infected and affected prisoners.\r\nKenya Prisons Service, pursuant to the\r\nPublic Sector Workplace Policy on HIV.\r\nand Aids, 2005 has developed a sector specific\r\npolicy which addresses the unique environment\r\nwhich curtailed liberties under which prisoners\r\nlive and the poor working conditions under which\r\nprisons staff work. The policy demonstrates the\r\nDepartment's commitment in taking fonvard\r\nsteps in the management of HN and Aids and\r\nforms a framework for an effective response.\r\nObjectives\r\nTIle main objective of this policy is to provide\r\na framework to effectively address EN and Aids\r\nwithin the Kenya Prisons Service.\r\nSpecifically, the Policy aims to:\r\nSet minimum internal requirements (MIR)\r\nfor managing HIV and Aids in the Prisons\r\nDepartment;\r\nEstablish structures and promote programmes\r\nto ensure non-discrimination and\r\nnon-stigmatisation of the infected and the affected;\r\nPrevent new infections among prisoners,\r\nprison staff and members of the surrounding\r\ncommunities;\r\nImprove the quality qf life of prisoners, prison\r\nstaff and members of the surrounding\r\ncommunities infected and affected by HN\r\nand Aids.\r\nMitigate the social and economic impact of\r\nHNandAids;\r\nEnsure expanded resource mobilization efforts\r\nto supplement government allocation to\r\nHN and Aids interventions;\r\nGuide prison staff and prisoners on their\r\nrights and obligations regarding HN and\r\n. Aids; and\r\nCreate and environment conducive to research,\r\ncapacity building, monitoring and\r\nevaluation."}
