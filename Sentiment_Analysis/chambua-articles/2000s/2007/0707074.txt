The leaders urged governments to
investigate why women and girls were
increasingly bearing the brunt of Aids
and address the root causes.
Dr Migiro, however, said challenges
facing women could not be addressed
in isolation.
Cultural stereotypes
"The change that we need will transform
relations between women and
men at all levels of society and free boys
and men from cultural stereotypes and
expectations, because they are part of
the solution" she stated.
Concern was also raised over the slow
response to anti~Aids campaigns.
Dr Chan and Dr Piot said aithough
there was considerable progress in universal
access to prevention, treatment,
care and support for all who needed
Anti-retroviral drugs, many countries
lagged behind.
Ms Chan called for increased focus
on prevention programmes, emphasising
on the need to strengthen the <;apacity
of overall health_systems, especially
the capacity of sexual and reproductive
health services to reach those in need.
She said poor health services were
to blame for transmission of HIV
from mothers to their babies. Married
women were also encouraged to go for
routine testing because ''being married
is not a safe haven," according to the
WHO official.
Universal access
Dr Piot said Aids was becoming a gender
issue and advised change of response
strategies. "What entered history
25 years ago as a disease of white
gay men is now increasingly affecting
women all over the world;' he said.
He called on all UN member states
to make universal access to ARV treat~
ment a reality.
He also called on governments to
speed up access to HIV treatment,
warning that countries may not be able
to meet the universal access target on
schedule.
"We need to do much better on both
HN treatment and prevention. If we

virus every day
----
continue at the current pace, there will
be fewer than five million people on
treatment by 2010, just over half of the
people who will need it;' he stated.
Dr Piot, who is also an under-secre~
tary general of the United Nations, said
while news that HIV infection levels
were declining across the regions was
encouraging, HIV cases remained unacceptably
high in many populations,
with 12,000 people infected every day,
a half of them women. He added that
for every person who started on ARV
therapy, another six become infected
with HIV.
Said Mr Piot: "This is not acceptable
and sustainable. This also means that
queues far access taMVtreatment will
just get longer and longer, pointing an
urgent need ta reassess and revitalise
HIV prevention." See als~ Page 11.
