{"text": "DAILY NATION Thursday July 19, 2007\r\nRESEARCH\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNew microbicides hold big promise\r\n\r\nAs the world waits for a HIV\r\nvaccine, research efforts\r\npromise a microbicide much\r\nearlier, writes ARTHUR\r\nOKWEMBA\r\n\r\nNew generations of microbicides that are\r\n. formulat.ed using antiretroviral drugs have\r\nrenewed hopes of getting a tool that would\r\nprevent HIV infectiQn before 2015. Since\r\nARVs have been shown to prolong the lives of people\r\ninfected 'With HIV; scientists\ufffd are positive that these\r\ncould be turned into effective microbicides.\r\n\"We are very optimistic about the second generation\r\nof microbicides because unlike the first genera.:.\r\ntion, we know of the biological responses between the\r\nvirus and the drugs,\" says Dr Zeda Rosenberg, the\r\nchief executive officer of the International Partner~\r\nship for Microbicides (IPM). Dr Rosenberg describes\r\nthe anti~HIVmicrobicide formulations based on ARVs\r\nas highly potent and HIV speciftc. They also come in\r\nsmall molecules, which help scientists develop different\r\ncombinations.\r\n\"Microbicides specifically designed to be active.\r\nagainst HIV as well as combination therapies hold the\r\npromise of even greater protection against HIV transmission\r\nthan earlier formulations,\" says IPM.\r\nPharmaceutical industries have given IPM free\r\nlicenses to develop, manufacture and distribute\r\nantiretroviral components as microbicides. They\r\ninclude GlaxoSmithKline, Gilead Sciences, Inc., and\r\nJohnson and Johnson pharmaceutical companies.\r\nARVs under utilization include a wide range of formulations\r\ncurrently being taken by people living\r\nwith HIVjAids. Microbicides are self-administered\r\ntopical substances that can blocktransmission of HIV\r\nor other sexually transmitted infections. They can\r\nbe produced in various forms. such as gels, creams,\r\nsponges, lubricants, and intravaginal rings that are\r\napplied inside the vagina or rectum.\r\nThose formulated using ARVs target HIV or the\r\ncells it infects. Some of these drugs stop HlV from\r\nbinding on a persons CD4 receptor of target ceil, a\r\ncritical processes that enables. the virus to replicate.\r\nCurrently, a microbicide gel formulated using tenofo~\r\nvir - one of the keyARVs used in HIV/Aids treatment\r\n- is in stage 2b of the trials in South Africa. This trial\r\nis being done on small number of volunteers to test\r\nits efficacy, before a bigger trial is done in the next\r\ncouple of months.\r\nWomen participating in this study are applying\r\nthe microbicide t'Wice: 12 hours before sex and 12\r\nhours after sex. In Africa, studies on ARV formp.lated\r\nmicrobicides are also taking place in Rwanda and\r\nTanzania.\r\nThe focus now is also on the dosages and the form\r\nin which these microbicides will be\ufffd delivered. Will it\r\nbe once or t'Wice a day, or come in the form of gels,\r\nintra~vaginal rings, or vaginal tablets. And can any\r\nof these forms be applied by a woman during or after\r\nsexual intercourse.\r\nIn fact, a lot of product acceptability studies are\r\ngoing across sub-Saharan African countries, where\r\nover 75 per cent of microbicide studies are being\r\nconducted. Efforts to ensure the tools are acceptable\r\nto women, and do not irritate or offend their male\r\npartners are underway.\r\nMicrobicides is one in the cocktail of tools including\r\nfemale condoms which are seen as the best way\r\nof empowering women to protect themselves against\r\nHIV. \"Women lack specific methods to protect themselves\r\nfrom HIV infection, especially when engaging\r\nin unprotected sex,\" says Dr Florence Mirembe of\r\nMakerere University, Uganda.\r\n\"There is\ufffd need to come up with a protection gear\r\nthat empowers them, since utilization of the female\r\ncondom remains low.\"\r\nThe challenge facing most microbicides developers\r\nis how to make those that will turn out to be effective\r\naccessible and affordable to the women who need\r\nthem most.\r\n\"Community members provide valuable insight\r\ninto the cultural contexts where the trials are going\r\nto take place, and need to be consulted prior to commencing\r\nthe research,\" says Pauline Irungu of Global\r\nCampaign for Mlcrobicides.\r\n- An Awe Feature~\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOD NOW A PRESCRIPTION IN HIV AIDS\r\nFood now a prescription in\r\nAids treatment programme\r\n\r\nevidence-based study on\r\nHIV/Aids treatment has demonstrated\r\nthat nutrition is an\r\n.mportant part of the medical\r\npackage, and that it must be included in\r\nmanaging the disease. As a result, two\r\ngovernment institutions in Eldoret are\r\nnow prescribing antiretroviral drugs\r\nalongside food as the full medical dose.\r\nThe institutions donate the food to the\r\nindex patient and family members for\r\nthe first six months, before engaging\r\nthem in money generating activities for\r\nself-support.\r\nThe initiative that began as an observation\r\nwith one patient in 2001 has\r\nover 50,000 HIV infected people and\r\ntheir dependants in western and North\r\nRift parts of the country.\r\nThe Moi University School of Medicine,\r\nMoi Teaching and Referral Hospital\r\nand the Indiana University of the\r\nUS have partnered in a program called\r\nAcademic Model for the Prevention and\r\nTreatment of HlV/Aids (AMPATH),\r\nwhich grows half of the required foodstuff\r\nwhile the rest is supplemented\r\nby donors including the World Food\r\n. Program (WFP).\r\nThe antiretrovirals are provided\r\nthrough the US President's Emergency\r\nPlan for Aids Relief. \"We harvest over\r\nsix metric tons of high valuehorticultural\r\nproducts weekly, which is half\r\nof the total food needed for the same\r\nperiod, and distribute them to some\r\nof our food insecure patients and their\r\nfamilies all over our area\ufffd of jurisdiction,\"\r\nsays Hanna Tadayo of AMPATH,\r\nWFP donates the remaining 50 per\r\ncent of the total food needed for about,\r\n30,000 patients and their families. This\r\ncomes in form of maize, legumes, corn\r\nsoy blend, and cooking fat to supplement\r\nAMPATH's green vegetables and\r\nfresh fruits. 'IWe realised that it was not\r\npracticable to feed the index patients\r\nwhile the rest of the family members\r\nstarved,\" says Dr Silvester Kimaiyo\r\nthe programme manager. This has\r\nforced the programme to include all\r\nthe dependants in its budget, where the\r\nratio is approximately one patient to six\r\ndependants.\r\nFrom the very first patient, the study\r\nhas demonstrated that with proper nutrition,\r\nHIV patients suffering from\r\nmalnutrition have been able to double\r\ntheir weight and improve their CD4\r\ncells count rapidly.\r\nSo far, the programme has one of\r\nits founding physicians nominated for\r\nthe prestigious Nobel Prize. Among the\r\ncrops grown through the project, are\r\nfruits and a wide range of vegetables.\r\n''We grow both traditional and exotie\r\ncrops which are locally acceptable and\r\navailable,\" says Steve Lewis, the project\r\ndirector.\r\nThe fruits grown on various or~\r\nchards include guavas, which grow\r\nwildly in the region, oranges, avocados,\r\nand tomatoes among others, while\r\nvegetables including kales, cabbages,\r\ncowpeas, amaranth, and all sorts of\r\ntraditional vegetable species.\r\n\"Some fruits like guavas are not\r\ngiven serious considerations yet they\r\nare very important in nutrition and are\r\nhigh in vitamin C,\" says Faniee Komen\r\na nutritionist with the project.\r\nDuring the six months of treatment\r\nand food program, the patients are\r\nenrolled in a programme which enables\r\nthem to achieve self~sufficiencythrough\r\nskills training and micro financing of\r\nprivate micro~enterprise.\r\n<IThrough this, HIV~positive clients\r\nare able to provide and care for their\r\nfamilies and children as well as develop\r\na new -sense of selt\" esteem,\" says\r\nBenjamin Andama, the FPI program\r\nmanager.\r\nThis has seen qver 3000 patients\r\ngraduate to a self-dependency level\r\nsince 2002. \"Those who opted for\r\npoultry projects are currently supply-\r\ning AMPATH with over 2000 eggs per\r\nweek, thus earning their daily bread\r\nfrom it,\" says Andama.\r\nOthers have ventured into passion\r\nfruit farming, tailoring, informal crea~\r\ntivity and clay work. AMPATH cares for\r\n.more than 50,000 HIV infected adults\r\nand children, with nearly one-half of\r\nall patients on anti\ufffdretroviral drugs,\r\nand enrollment into the program rising\r\nby 2,000 patients per month.\r\nA robust program to prevent mother\r\nto child transmission of HIV has been\r\ninitiated. Ail the AMPATH facilities\r\nare operated by the Kenya Ministry\r\nof Health in. Western Kenya and are\r\nlocated in 18 government clinics.\r\n- ISAIAH ESIPISU"}
