{"text": "Daily NATION 30 June, 2007\r\n\r\nWOMENS HEALTH\r\nHandling sexual debut among the youth\r\nBy SARAH ONYANGO\r\n\r\nWhat would you tell your 16-year-old\r\ndaughter going on a week-loug school\r\ntrip if she got herself a double sleepingbag?\r\nThis is the dilemma a mother of a teenage girl\r\nrecently found herself in. Although she did not\r\nwant to expect or suspeCt the worst, her mind\r\nwas running fast. Sometbiugwas not right here,\r\nespecially since this trip included boys too.\r\nShe asked: \"Why have you bought yourself\r\na double sleeping bag? Everyone will probably\r\nbriug their own bags?\" .\r\n\"Just in case one of myfriends does~t, then\r\nthey can share mine;' she replied.\r\n\"Which of your friends would not.' have\r\naneT .'\r\n\"Mum~ .. just in case. You neverlmowwho\"\r\nmight forget'~\r\nThe mother was not convinced, and she' was\r\nworried. Thinking that she must act to sort out\r\nthe situation, she sat her daughter down and\r\nquickly took her through key issues around\r\nsex and sexuality; about being safe, about abstinence\r\nand about unwanted pregnancies and\r\nHIV/Aids, about self-esteem and self respect.\r\nNot sure that this was enQugh to address the\r\nproblem, she got her daughtersome condoms\r\nand pills. Just in case.\r\nBut when should we be talking to our children\r\nabout sexand sexuality; about their bodies,\r\nand about wnat to expect as they grow older?\r\nWhen should we be teaching them skills that\r\nwill ensure that they have all the confidence in\r\nthemselves; confidence enough to be able to say\r\nno - until the right time.\r\nReproductive life\r\nSexual debut, or age at first sex, is an important\r\npoint in the sexual and reproductive life ofindi~\r\nviduals. Earlysexual debut means increased risk\r\nof exposure to sexually transmitted infections,\r\nincluding HIV/Aids, increased risks ofunwanted\r\npregnancies and unsafe abortions. Studies\r\nshow that as the age at marriage increases, the\r\nage of sexual debut remains the same.\r\nThis means that there is a longer 'Window\r\nwhere young people are not in a stable relationship\r\nor marriage, increasing the possible\r\nexposure to sexual risks. Studies also showthat\r\nearly sexual debut increases sexual risk behaviours\r\nthroughout life, including the risk ofhaving\r\nunprotected sex and having multiple and\r\ncasual sexual partners.\r\nThese risks once established areverydifficult\r\nto reverse. Once sexually active, young people\r\nhave been. found to be less concerned about\r\nsafer sex and frequently have unprotected sex.\r\nThey prefer to use emergency contraception,\r\nrather than a regular contraceptive, for many\r\nreasons, including the many myths that exist\r\nabout contraception. They are also likely to\r\nhave abortions if they find themselves with an\r\nunwanted pregnancy sometimes in the hands\r\nof unskilled providers. Kenyan girls are having\r\ntheir sexual debut at a very early age, according\r\nto a study conductedbyInfotrack Research\r\nand Consultant Company and disseminated\r\nearlythis year. Over 70 per cent ofWomen aged\r\nbetween 18 and 25 are no longer virgins and\r\ngirls are haviug their sexual debut as young as\r\n12years of age - 9 per cent ofthose interviewed\r\nin Nairobi.\r\nThere is need for concerted efforts to ensure\r\nthat childrep. and youth have access to quality\r\nsexuality education programmes. Through\r\ncomprehensive education, notwithstanding\r\nother social and economic factors, this will not\r\nonly increase knowledge about sex and sexuality;\r\nbut also empower the young people to be\r\n~ble to make conscious decis~ons.\r\nSexuality education\r\nBeing well informed would discourage the\r\nyouug people from \"discoveriug\" for themselves\r\nthe risks of early sexual debut. Anysexuality education\r\nprogramme must recognise. cultures,\r\nmorals and traditional values of communities\r\ninvolved, While teaching youug people about\r\ntheir bodies, about sexuality, building their\r\nskills and self-confidence and dispelling myths\r\nand misconceptions.\r\nSexuality education is the keyto delaying sexual\r\ndebut, and reducing the associated risks. It\r\nmust target both boys and girls.\r\nThere is also the need to promote youthfriendly\r\n.sexual and reproductive health services,\r\nwhere young people can receive couriselling\r\non sexuality, pregnancy, contraception and\r\nother services in a non-judgmental environment.\r\nDealing with sex and sexuality issues of\r\nyoung people should be the concerted efforts of\r\nparents, teachers, religious leaders and community\r\nmembers. The most importantthiug is that\r\nthere should be an adult who can have regular\r\ndialogue on these issues with theyoung person\r\nand earn their confidence.\r\nsarah.onyango@ppfa.or.ke"}
