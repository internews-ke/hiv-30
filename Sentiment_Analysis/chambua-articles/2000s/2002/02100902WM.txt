{"text": "\ufeff9th October 2002\r\n\r\nJailed for two years over an\r\nuntruthful Aids accusation\r\n\r\nCONTINUED    FROM PAGE 1\r\ncould not be attended to. Instead, we were referred\r\nto the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital.\r\nIt was there that the man's eight-year-old san\r\nwas tested for the human immunodeficiency virus\r\n(HIV) and found to be positive.\r\nI was put in a vehicle and driven to the Eldaret\r\nPolice Station, then booked into a cell. All this\r\ntime, I thought it was a bad dream and that I would\r\nwake up in the safety and familiar surroundings of\r\nhome. Being booked in the cell had a sobering\r\neffect on me. I realised that something was terribly\r\nwrong. That was when I started crying. My mind\r\nran wild as I imagined what I would be subjected\r\nto. I had heard abaut the cruelty that the police\r\nmete out to peaple held in cells. One could even be\r\njailed for a crime one had not committed.\r\nI stayed in the cells overnight. The following\r\nday, some police officers started questioning me. I\r\ntried to. answer their questions as fully as possible.\r\nEach day, hawever, far the follawing two weeks,\r\nthey kept grilling me even as I pleaded my inno-\r\ncence on all their accusations. Some seemed to\r\nbelieve me but after some time, they must have\r\ndecided that I should be taken to court.\r\n\"Phyllis Khavenza. You are charged that on\r\nSeptember 20, 20()O, at Shauri Yako Estate of\r\nEldoret in Uasin Gishu District, you indecently\r\nassaulted an under-age boy, causing him actual\r\nbodily harm, contrary to Section 164 of the Penal\r\nCode, and infected him with HIV/Aids.\"\r\n\r\nIce needles\r\nI felt my blood turn into      a million needles of ice.\r\nStill, I found vaice to deny    what the prasecutar was\r\nsaying. When I was asked        if the charge was true, I\r\nflatly denied it.\r\nI felt confused and was    ashamed   to look peaple\r\nin the eye. The courtraom was jammed. I felt very\r\nbitter. I was informed that I could be given a\r\nSh50,OOO bond but I could not raise such an\r\namount of maney. Neither could my newly-\r\nwidowed mother.\r\nSo off to. remand prisan 1 went.\r\nI was taken to the OK Prison in Eldoret, where I\r\nspent close to two years. It was here that I alsb had\r\nmy son seven months later. I named him Meshack,\r\nafter my father. I gave birth at the Moi Teaching\r\nand Referral Haspital. It was a normal birth, with-\r\nout any camplications. It was trying caring for a\r\n\r\nbaby in prison. All that I had to give him was par~\r\nridge, and sometimes milk, in small quantities, sup-\r\nplied by sympathetic female prison wardens.\r\nI used to stay with my son the whole day in the\r\nprisan compound. I never went out to work. The\r\nliving conditians were unhealthy, and I often fell\r\nill. Every time I remembered         that I had been\r\nwrongfully accused I wept. I felt relieved after\r\nshedding tears. Initially, the women wardens used\r\nto beat me, but they later started empathising with\r\n\r\nme as the case continued to be heard. They started\r\n\r\ntelling me they were remorseful for what had hap-\r\n\r\npened and prayed that the case ended in my\r\nfavour.\r\n\r\nThe boy had testified that he had gane to. the\r\n\r\nestate to visit a friend when he met me. That I had\r\ntold him I wanted to send him with money to\r\n\r\nsomebody. It was all lies. I knew the boy very well\r\nbecause he 'was my younger' brather's playmate.\r\nBeyond that, it was all conjecture.\r\n\r\nHe claimed that I had led him to my house, shut\r\nthe door and forced him onto my bed.\r\nHis face was calm as he told the caurt in a plain-\r\n. tive voice: 'She taok aff my short trausers and\r\nstarted touching my private parts. She then took\r\noff her pants and shirt, held me and placed me on\r\nthe bed. She then farced me to. have sex with her.'\r\nI felt so ashamed, knawing that people believed\r\nthe bay more. He never looked me in the eye and I\r\nknew he was afraid af his father.\r\n\r\ne had told the court that he started bleeding\r\nH        in his private parts after we allegedly had\r\nsex and that when he gat hame, he informed\r\nhis father.\r\n\r\nThe examination       at the Moi Teaching and\r\nReferral Hospital had established that the boy was\r\nHIV positive, that his private parts were swollen\r\nand that he had genital wounds.\r\nBut the prosecution had nat examined me to\r\nestablish whether I was also HIV pasitive.\r\nInitially the boy's father used to come to court\r\nbut he just disappeared. He is a small-scale trader\r\nat the Eldoret West market. Even naw he is not\r\nseen at his house.\r\nI had not spoken to a lawyer, but I kept asking\r\n\r\nmyself: \"How came I am being accused of infecting\r\nPHYLLIS KHAVENZA: \"I thought I was going to jail for a\r\nthe boy with Aids?\"\r\nWhen my turn to give evidence came, I asked the\r\nmagistrate why the boy's father was nat testifying.\r\nWhy was I still strong and healthy two years after I\r\nhad been accused of having Aids, yet I did nat feed\r\nwell? Why was my son, wham I delivered in prisan,\r\nhealthy and yet he was only fed on parridge and an\r\noccasional measure af milk given to me by empa-\r\n\r\nthising female warders?\r\n\r\nIt was then that the prosecutor asked that I be\r\n\r\ntested for HIV. The results af that August I test\r\nwere negative. Then I wanted to know why I was\r\n\r\nHIV-negative when I was being accused of inlect-\r\n\r\ning the boy. I was tested again, and the results were\r\n\r\nstill negative.\r\nAlthough a repart from the Mai Teaching and\r\nReferral Hospital found the boy to \u00b7be HIV-\r\n\r\npasitive, with swollen sexual organs and genital\r\nwaunds, I was HIV negative and did not have any\r\ngenital wounds. The report ruled aut the possibility\r\nof my having been treated in prison remand since\r\nthe process was technical and difficult, and not\r\navailable at the prisons health facility.\r\nThis new evidence forced the magistrate to set\r\nSeptember 19 as the date of the ruling, but it was\r\nbrought farward by two days.\r\nOn September 17, at 6 pm, I was brought befare\r\nSenior Principal Magistrate Lucy Gitari. I felt very\r\napprehensive.     I did not know why I had been\r\nbrought to caurt two days early. I thaught I was\r\ngoing to jail for a crime I did not cammit.\r\nThe margistrate started by nating that the boy's\r\n\r\nfather did not testify to. corrabarate       evidence\r\ntauching him. He had also declined to. sign a palice\r\nbond as a court witness.\r\nBut more importantly, she nated that the prose-\r\ncutian had failed to examine me to establish if I was\r\nalso HIV pasitive. It anly applied far the test to be\r\ndone after I painted this out.\r\n\r\nNo sexual contact\r\nThe prosecution, she said, had failed to prove that\r\n\r\nany sexual contact taok place between myself and\r\nthe boy. Since the complainant was of a tender age,\r\nshe said. his evidence needed to be corroborated.\r\nI felt relief wash all over my tired body when I\r\nheard the magistrate say: \"The complainant must\r\nhave mistakenly implicated her. I find her not guilty\r\nand acquit her.'\r\nI felt happy that the magistrate made the right\r\ndecision but at the same time, I felt bitter that I h\r\n\r\nto suffer for wrongs I had not committed, all\r\n\r\nbecause   of turning down this man's sexual\r\n\r\nadvances.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was innocent\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I watched the prasecutar, Chief Inspector Oba-\r\ndiah Magatti, gather his papers, I felt very bitter\r\nthat I had been made to stay in prison for two dren s\r\n\r\nyears, have my child in jail, when I was innacent.\r\nThere was nobady in court when I was released\r\nat 6 pm. I walked home. penniless. Mum was sur- churc\r\nprised to. See me enter the house as the darkness set\r\nin. She had planned to come to court an September\r\n19 for the judgment. When she learnt that I had\r\nbeen freed. she was so overjoyed that we sat up late\r\ninto. the night talking about the whole ordeal.\r\nI was told in court that I could take legal actian\r\nbut I am poor. We live in a single-room house with \u2022\r\nmy unemployed mother and four other children. I unpro\r\ncannot institute legal action within the 14 days af e\r\nthe judgment date.\r\nI would like to. appeal to human rights organisa-\r\ntions and the International Federation of Women\r\nLawyers [Fida] to assist me sue for compensatian\r\n\r\nfor wrongful confinement.\r\nI think the bay's father should also be arrested\r\nfor giving false information to. the polic\r\nWhatever is done to. right past wrongs, I know SaY\r\nthat I will always live with this stigma, which I hav\r\nlived with since I was arrested when I was 17. I feel\r\ntarmented but now, at least my name has been ment wit\r\ncleared and I am relieved.\r\nMy son's father went to. seek employment in Nai- r\r\nrobi soonafter I was remanded.,        \"\r\n\r\n\r\nwednesday@nation.co.ke"}
