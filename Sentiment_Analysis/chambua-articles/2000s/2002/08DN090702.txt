powerful case for turning the campaign against Aids into a
political issue.
   There is every reason we should take heed in Kenya.
Twenty years into the epidemic, there is hardly any Kenyan
who has not been touched by Aids in one way or another.
   Yet the campaign against it remains muted and we lack the
political commitment necessary to scale it up into concrete
action on all fronts.
   As the 14th international Aids conference gathers steam in
Barcelona, we are reminded of the need to consolidate
leadership in this battIe for life.
   The fight against HIV/Aids cannot be divorced from
governance issues, poverty and human rights. It is not just
about developing paperwork. It is also about making
available the resources necessary to care for those living with
the disease and preventing further infections.
   During the United Nations General Asscmbly on Aids, the
Kenyan Government committed itself to actions on:
leadership, prevcntion, carc, support and treatmcnt, human
rights, reducing vulncrability, children orphaned and made
vulnerable by HIV/Aids, alleviating the social and economic                                                                                    SABA SABA 0 MACHARIA GAITHO

   By signing on the dotted line, our Government pledged
that it would implement multi-sectoral strategies and finance
plans that confront silence, dcnial, stigma and discrimination.                                                 Opposition sulks into oblivion
