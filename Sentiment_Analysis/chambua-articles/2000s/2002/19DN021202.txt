Funerals, prayers mark World Aids Day
            JOHANNESBURG,                              Sunday
Millions of people around the globe marked
World Aids Day today with marches,
prayers and hope amid grim statistics which
show the raging epidemic outpacing all
efforts to control it.
   In China, officials instructed one million
students to launch a new national Aids
awareness campaign; in Britain, health
experts warned of a startling spike in new
infections, and in South Africa - the coun-
try worst hit by the disease - they held a
mass funeral for babies.
   "We pay tribute to all the children who
have passed away in our care," said Ms
Jackie Schoeman of the Cotlands Baby
Sanctuary, which held a ceremony today in·
Johannesburg to inter the cremated ashes of
some of the littlest victims.
   Today's activities highlight how danger-
ously the disease has spread since it was first
detected among homosexual men in the
United States in 1981.
