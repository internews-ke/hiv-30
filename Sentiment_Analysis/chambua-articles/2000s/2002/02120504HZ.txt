{"text": "\ufeffDaily Nation/ Thursday December 5,2002\r\n\r\nResearcher moves to circumcise adult males\r\n\r\nCONTINUED FROM PAGE 1\r\nargue thill the evidence from small-scale surveys is\r\nnot conclusive enough to qualify circumcision as an\r\nintervention.\r\nOther scientists have dismissed the studies, saying\r\nthey do not show any causal relationship between\r\ncircumcision and reduced rate of HIV infection.\r\nHence demand has increased on studies to\r\nproduce hard data.\r\nIN particular, scientists have refused to dismiss\r\nsuch a correlation and are determined to investigate\r\nmore, ,~specially with indications of circumcised\r\nmales with low viral loads showing less likelihood\r\nof transmitting the HIV virus to their female\r\npartners.\r\nProf Achola's study has generated some heat\r\namong local scientists. Many question the costs,\r\nsafety and ethical aspects of it.\r\nSome scientist are afraid the costs of mass circumcision\r\nmay be so exorbitant as to make the\r\nstrategy financially prohibitive.\r\nMr James Ntozi, a Makerere University lecturer,\r\nis afraid money will be diverted from other social\r\nneeds to pay for the circumcision.\r\nOthers say the safety issue must be thrashed out.\r\nThey point out that some men have died from major\r\ncomplications after circumcision and that it is, at\r\nany rate, too invasive a procedure.\r\nProf Achola, however, argues that his team employs\r\ncircumcision experts supervised by a Data\r\nSafety Monitoring team of Kenyan and American\r\nexperts.\r\nThere are concerns that men circumcised in this\r\nway may engage in unprotected sex, thinking they\r\nare fortified against HIV. Indeed, interviews show\r\nthat they consider circumcision as an invisible condom.\r\nSays Kisumu's John Odhiambo:\"1 have heard of\r\nthis thing about circumcised men not getting infected.\r\nI think that, in that case, one may not need a\r\ncondom because one is naturally protected.\"\r\nThe Population Council of Kenya fears that, in\r\nthis circumstance, \"men may use their circumcision\r\nstatus as a reason for not using condoms and women\r\nmay be less iriclined to insist on condoms if their\r\nmale partners are circumcised.\"\r\n\"In this scenario,\" says the council, \"wom~n are\r\nat an increased risk of contracting the virus and this\r\nmay reduce the potentia] beneficial effects On HIV\r\ntransmission of male circumcision\".\r\nOthers fear a resurgence of FFmale Genital Mutilationif\r\ncircumcising men is linked to HIV prevention.\r\nBut Prof Achola insist~ his team has addressed\r\nall the ethical issues. i\r\n\"We are very aware that sonie young men may\r\nengage in unsafe sex thinking circumcision makes\r\nthem safe,\" says he. \"Our apprfach is to educate\r\nthem on HIV/Aids and we empHasise to them that\r\nno authoritative evidence exists yet to indicate circumcision\r\nreduces HIV infection.\r\nAnother argument against the study is that it\r\nmay interfere with certain communal norms connected\r\nwith circumcision. Consequently, any attempt\r\nto use circumcision against HIV infection\r\nmay meet much resistance.\r\nBesides this, the age at which a person needs to\r\nbe circumcised has raised other practical issues.\r\nTh,ere are worries that older men may be left out of\r\nthe strategy, since studies elsewhere in Africa show\r\nthat circumcision as an anti-HIV measure is more\r\neffective beforeor soon after puberty.\r\n[n 1999 study in Uganda, Kelly Kiwanuka found\r\nthat men circumcised before puberty - between 13\r\nancl 20 - had a lower risk of HIV infection compared\r\nwith their uncircumcised ones.\r\nBut, despite the various opinions, researchers\r\nbelieve studies must be carried out to put all these\r\nissues to rest. The results of Prof Achola's study are\r\nexpected in five years.\r\nBut, he says, the study will be discontinued if it\r\noverwhelmingly indicates that the percentage of infection\r\namong men circumcised during the study is\r\nsignificantly lower than infection among the uncircumcised.\r\nAnd conclusions will be made based on the result~:\r\nat that particular point.\r\nMany scientists, although believing there is a\r\ncorrelation between circumcision and HIV infection,\r\nthey are yet to find out just how this happens.\r\nSeveral scientists hypothesise that the foreskin\r\nhas a high density of cells known langerhans which\r\nrepresent a possible source of the first conduct and\r\nconduce to HIV infection.\r\nIru the 19H9 Lancet No H660, D. Cameron and\r\nothers, in their paper \"Female to Male transmission\r\nof HIV type 1: Risk factors for seroconversion in\r\nmen\", claimed that the foreskin might provide an\r\nenvironment in which bacteria and viral matter may\r\nsurvive long enough to increase the likelihood of\r\nHIV infection.\r\nIts susceptibility to tears, scratches and abrasions\r\nmay also increase the chances of one contracting\r\nthe virus.\r\n-AWe-Features"}
