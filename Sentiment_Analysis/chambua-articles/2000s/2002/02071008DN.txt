Like other Government          departments,  !t ar~ues, it is\r\nunder instruction not to enter any more hands mto Its\r\npayroll.\r\n    That is the reason it has opted merely to fill the vacancies,\r\nnot to create more places.      But there is a compelling\r\nargument for a bigger teaching force.\r\n    A growing population means increased school enrolment\r\nand hence the need for more teachers. This is critical at this\r\npoint of increased teacher deaths from HIV /Aids.\r\n    And, although education is a service \"industry\" and,          .\r\ntherefore, does not provide immediate monetary returns, Its\r\nsignificance for socio-economic      growth is indisputable. To\r\ninvesting more money in it, whenever possible, cannot be in\r\nvain.\r\n    If MPs, who are already overfed, can increase their own                                                                 NEW HOPE FOR FARMERS 0 JAINDI KISERO\r\nsalaries by big margins, it becomes even more compelling to\r\nspend additional money to employ more teachers to support\r\nmillions of Kenyan children.\r\n    At any rate,'the Government    has committed itself to                                                   State moves to revive APe\r\nproviding quality universal primary education by 2005 and\r\nquality basic education for all, including marginalised groups,\r\nby 2015.
