   Since its creation in the 1990s, the Board has done a
commendable job of dishing out loans and ensuring a
m~jo~ity of past ~eneficiaries paid up. But sadly, though its
cntena for selectmg who deserves loans and who does not is
fairly stringent, it is not foolproof.
   Consequently, many undeserving cases have mastered how
to cheat in the loan application forms, and in the end, a good
number of deserving cases miss out.
   But an announc~ment last week that universities will
henceforth be involved in vetting loan applicants might
minimise cheating.
   The institutions ~ill be required to verify information on
the application forms with the students' records to ascertain
the truth of the information given. The Board also intends to
furnish the benefic~aries' parents with information on the
amounts given to their offspring.
   Many students fail to disclose such information to parents
who end up giving the students extra funds at the expense of                                                                           SEXUALITY AND YOUTH 0 LUCY ORIANG'
