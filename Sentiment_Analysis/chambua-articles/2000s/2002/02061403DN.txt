{"text": "\ufeffDaily Nation /Friday, June 14,2002\r\n\r\nGRUMBLES OVER MINISTERS NEW RECIPE\r\nOpposition MPs dismissed Finance\r\nMinister Chris Obure's budget\r\nproposals as an election gimmick\r\nimpossible to implement while those in\r\nKanu described it as the best ever.\r\nShadow Finance Minister David\r\nMwiraria said the removal of import\r\nduty on agricultural raw materials and\r\nfertiliser was positive but added that the\r\npoor would be hardest-hit by tax on\r\nkerosene.\r\nThe government's plan to revive the\r\nstalled Kenya Meat Commission was\r\ndescribed as the \"best gimmick\" to woo\r\nvoters from pastoralist communities.\r\nFormer Finance Minister Chris\r\nOkemo said the minister \"walked a\r\ntightrope\" in trying to come up with a\r\nbudget that did not anticipate donor\r\nsupport.\r\nWith a shrinking tax base and lack of\r\ndonor support, he said, the minister\r\nwould have no choice but to continue\r\nborrowing from the local market to\r\nmeet the budget deficit of Sh37 billion.\r\nProf Anyang' Nyong'o described the\r\nBudget as simplistic and dwelling on\r\npetty issues. Said the Social Democratic\r\nParty nominated MP: \"The minister\r\nshould have thought big. He should\r\nhave spelt out measures to get the\r\nthousands of unemployed\r\nyouth into the information\r\ntechnology industry.\"\r\nFord Kenya chairman\r\nMichael Wamalwa\r\ndescribed it as \"toQ\r\noptimistic\". The minister\r\nfailed to spell out the\r\nspecific measures he would\r\ntake to give farmers the\r\nincentive to produce, Mr Wamalwa said.\r\nMr Njeru Kathangu (Ford-A,\r\nRunyenjes) welcomed moves to revive\r\nthe textile industry and address\r\nHIV/Aids.\r\nDr Newton Kulundu (Ford-K,\r\nLurambi) said most of the money\r\nproposed for HIV /Aids awareness\r\nprogrammes should have gone into\r\npurchase of drugs.\r\nThe chairman of the Kenya Business\r\nCouncil, Mr Wilfred Kiboro, said that\r\nthe Budget did not show any\r\ncommitment on the part of the\r\ngovernment to alleviate poverty and\r\ncreate employment.\r\nMr Kiboro, the immediate former\r\nchairman of the Federation of Kenya\r\nEmployers, predicted that more\r\nKenyans would be poorer next year in\r\nspite of the two per cent economic\r\ngrowth rate projected by the Minister\r\nfor Finance.\r\n\"It's difficult to understand how\r\ncompanies can grow in a shrinking\r\neconomy that grows at two per cent\r\nwhile the population rate is growing at\r\nthree per cent,\" Mr Kiboro said.\r\nHe said that the minister had failed\r\nstate how he would reduce government\r\nexpenditure and address the Sh30\r\nbillion budget deficit experienced last\r\nfinancial year. .\r\n\"There is not effort to restructure the\r\npublic service and address the budget\r\ndeficit,\" Mr Kiboro added .\r\n\"The slapping of VAT on mobile\r\nphone communication is just going for an\r\neasy option at a time when the cost of\r\nphones is already to high because land\r\nlines are not readily available.\r\n\"The two per cent growth rate that the\r\ngovernment is projecting shows that they\r\nare running out of ideas. Why should we\r\ntarget a two per cent growth rate when\r\nour neighbours are targeting a six to\r\neight per cent growth rate?\" Mr Kiboro\r\nposed during an interview.\r\nHe criticised the increase of duty on\r\nkerosene for targeting the poor and\r\ntermed in \"insensitive.\"\r\nHowever, the council chairman\r\nwelcomed the zero-rating of import duty\r\non raw materials and capital equipment\r\nfor manufacturers.\r\nOn the injection by the government of\r\nSh300 million in micro-finance for the\r\nagricultural sector, Mr Kiboro said that it\r\nwas a good sign but insufficient for a\r\nsector that contributes 25 per cent of the\r\nGross Domestic Product.\r\nHe added that the scrapping of import\r\nduty on imported timber was insincere.\r\n\"By adding tax on kerosene, the poor\r\nwill destroy the environment by using\r\nfirewood as fueL\"\r\nBut East African Legislative Assembly\r\nmember Mohammed\r\nZubedi (Kenya)\r\nsupported the\r\nproposals and asked\r\nleaders to help the\r\nminister implement\r\nthem.\r\nNational Party of\r\nKenya leader Charity\r\nNgilu dismissed it as\r\nan unrealistic \"campaign budget\".\r\nMr Ochillo Ayacko (Kanu, Rongo)\r\nwelcomed the exclusion of donors in this\r\nyear's Budget.\r\nMr Peter 0100 Aringo (Alego Usonga,\r\nKanu), said the Budget Speech was\r\n\"ritualistic\". He added: \"It is not the first\r\ntime the government has promised it was\r\ngoing to revive the KMC. Why should we\r\nbelieve it now?\"\r\nSugar cane farmers in Nyanza and\r\nWestern provinces said the Budget failed\r\nto address their plight. They singled out a\r\nprovision slapping a 100 per cent duty on\r\nsugar imported from Comesa members.\r\nThey dismissed as too lenient the\r\nmore.-than-200,000 metric tonnes duty\r\nbenchmark. Besides, they argued, the\r\nminister was silent on punitive measures\r\nagainst unscrupulous traders who\r\nconnived to import less than 200,000\r\nmetric tonnes separately to dodge the\r\n'lOOper cent duty.\r\nSeveral hoteliers in Kisumu,\r\nKakamega, Bungoma and Busia\r\nwelcomed the duty waiver on imported\r\nfurniture for upgrading touristic facilities.\r\nThere will also be no duty on imported\r\nnets and incidental gear.\r\n\r\nReported by Njeri Rugene, Owino\r\nOpondo, George Kiaye and Muriithi\r\nMuriuki"}
