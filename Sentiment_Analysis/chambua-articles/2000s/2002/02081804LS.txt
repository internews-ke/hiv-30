{"text": "\ufeffSunday Nation/ August 18, 2002\r\n\r\nTHE TRIBULATIONS OF A SLOPES BACHELOR\r\n\r\nSome decades ago, there existed the\r\ncharacters called bachelors and they\r\nsurvived basically because of a number\r\nof things. One of them was that there\r\nwere other characters called Patel who\r\nhad gone to school and read medicine. The Patels\r\nknew the needs of the bachelors then and so when\r\nthey were reading medicine, they paid special\r\nattention to a drug called penicillin.\r\nThe bachelors also survived because there were\r\nather fellows who had not read any medicine but\r\nwho made it their business to sell medicine all the\r\nsame. They were characters who could neither read\r\nnor write their own names but all the same turned\r\nthemselves into street pharmacies.\r\nThe characters sold .only three drugs. They were\r\na tablet called MB, another one called Suta and\r\nsome capsules withaut a name. The street\r\npharmacists stood at- street corners and after\r\nensuring that there was no man trained in Kiganjo\r\naround, they started announcing what they had on\r\nsale. They normally said under -their breath:\r\n\"MB:Suta-Capsules kama umeungl/a.\"\r\nMB was just a white tablet and although the two\r\nletters simply meant May and Baker, being the\r\nmakers of the drug, it was supposed to cure\r\nanything ranging from a headache to stomach\r\nulcers. Suta was a brown tablet and it too was\r\nsupposed to teach many diseases a lesson. Thus if\r\nthugs set upon you and nearly cut yaur leg in twa,\r\nyou did nat have ta warry. You just crushed some-\r\nSuta tablets into pawder and paured it inta the\r\nwound .. The wound was suppased ta understand\r\nthat it was being dealt with by Suta and therefare\r\nneeded ta behave itself.\r\nThe more the colours, the tougher\r\nThe capsules came in many calours and the more\r\ncalaurful it was, the taugher it was suppased ta be.\r\nThe capsules were hawever suppased ta deal with\r\none main problem. It WaS a prablem that afflicted\r\nbachelors and it was what the street pharmacists\r\ncalled \"kuungl/a\" or being burnt. That was their\r\nway of saying suffering fram the many tribes .of\r\ndiseases that are relatives .of Aids.\r\nAids had nat discavered itself by then but its\r\nrelatives were there and came in many tribes. They\r\ndid nat kill and any bachelar warth his name had ta\r\nsuffer from .one .of the \"kuungl/a\" diseases or the\r\nather. The first time yau gat it, yau went abaut\r\ntelling any bachelor wha wished ta listen ta you\r\nthat you had been hit by it. If yau were nat hit by it,\r\nyau imagined yau were and went telling everybady\r\nabaut yaur suffering.\r\nYau did sa because it was the .only way of telling\r\nthe warld that yau were so taugh that you had been\r\ninvolved in certain encaunters .of the adult kind\r\nthat had resulted in yau being' afflicted with\r\nsamething that required you to visit Dr Patel .or the\r\ncharacters who sold MB, Suta and Capsules. It\r\nseemed that it would be knawn you were tough\r\nonly if you were struck by the relatives .of Aids.\r\nFor most .of the days when I was a bachelor, I\r\navoided senior sins because I had graduated from\r\nthe position of an altar boy under the regime of\r\nthat Italian priest called Father Camissassius. The\r\nItalian with a peeling nose had warned against what\r\nhe called the sins of the flesh and sa I did nat get\r\nthe disease that would have led me to the street\r\n_ pharmacies or Dr Patel.\r\nThat, hawever, did not stop me fram cammitting\r\nthe smaller sin .of telling lies that I had been struck\r\nby .one of thase terrors that came after an\r\nencounter with a 'daughter of the soil. In my\r\nfaalishness, which I mistook for wisdom, I told the\r\nbachelors who were willing to listen: \"I have been\r\nstruck by the burning one. Indeed, I have been\r\nburnt out totally and it is all the work of Lucia.\"\r\nLucia was the most beautiful girl in the village.\r\nShe was also in the habit of rejecting the\r\n. applications of the young men in the village. She\r\nactually walked and talked as if she was the sister of\r\na number of saints. Indeed, she was not the kind .of\r\ngirl that any fe\\law with jigger-infested toes was\r\ngaing to approach. It wauld have been a miracle far\r\nLucia ta suffer fram anything mare than a common\r\ncold.\r\nI, hawever, told the lie that I was in the state that\r\nthe fellows wha sold Suta, MB and capsules called\r\nkuungua for two reasons. One, so that the other\r\nbachelors would know that I, san of Appep, was so\r\ntough that I had managed ta talk Lucia, the\r\ndaughter of Baranjeska, into sin. The second\r\nreason was to give Lucia a bad name. She deserved\r\na bad name because of behaving as if she was the\r\nsister of Jesus.\r\nThe other characters believed me and so they\r\nloaked at me with envy. A man who had been\r\ninflicted with something deadly by Lucia was to be\r\nadmired. From then an, Lucia entered the list of\r\nshame.\r\nThis is to say that I did not visit the street\r\npharmacies or Dr Patel but sti\\l I know what\r\nhappened when a bachelor was struck. by one of\r\nthose burning diseases. We did not have real money\r\nso the first option was to head to the street\r\npharmacies armed with something like ten bob.\r\nTen bob was just about enough money to buy a\r\nprescription.\r\nYou approached such a pharmacist with caution\r\nsince you did nat want your future mather-in-Iaw\r\nsee you shopping for the capsules. So yau looked\r\ndown the street and .once sure that the wrong eyes\r\nwere nat loaking, you stood near the character wha\r\nwas mouthing, \"MB, Suta capsules kama\r\numeungua. \"\r\nOnce you were there, you said under yaur\r\nbreath, \"Lete tatu\". The fellow decided that he was\r\nnot going to give you the three capsules yau wanted\r\nbefare he interrogated yau. So he asked, \"Ni ya\r\nhoma kali ama homa isiyo kali sana. Karim ni homa\r\nkali, nunua kapsul tano. Hizo ni twenty bob. \" (Is\r\nthis far a major cold or for a mild one? If it's a\r\nmajor one, take five. That will be twenty Shillings)\r\nBy homo, the fellow did not mean ~ camman\r\ncald. He meant the affliction that was a distant\r\nrelative of Aids. When he asked you whether it was\r\nhoma kali, he wanted ta know which, tribe the\r\naffliction belonged to. In short, the fo::lIow was\r\ntrying ta be a Dr Patel in his own way although he\r\nhad nat laoked at baoks, be they of medicine or\r\notherwise. !\r\n'Leave out any alcohol'\r\nAfter you explained whether it was hOff/a kali or\r\nnot, the fellaw passed the capsules to yau secretly\r\nas he mumbled, \"Na usikunywe pombel\r\n, ukilumia\r\nhizo kapsul, Zina chemical ambayo' haipendi\r\npambe.\" (Do not take any alcahol, the capsules\r\nhave a chemical that dislikes alcahal).\r\nThus you left the fellow assured .of tatal recovery\r\nbut then things never worked. They never worked\r\nbecause some of those capsules were mere\r\nvitamins. They were not supposed to attack the fire\r\nthat was burning a specific part of the body. That is\r\nwhy it was impartant to visit Dr Patel. :\r\n, The Dr Patel up the Slopes where I was barn and\r\nbrought up was visited by the bachelors wha cauld\r\naffard a whale 30 bob. Thirty bob was what yau\r\npaid the man for a full dose .of penicillin so that the\r\nhoma kali induced by sinning cauld bo:: cured.\r\nThirty bab was what it cost to buy a breathing gaat\r\naccompanied by its kid, meaning real wealth.\r\n. That is why Dr Patel was open to negdtiations.\r\nThis is to say that he understood the pains of a\r\nbachelor paying so dearly for his sins an4 that is\r\nwhy he told yau, \"I can give you half an iinjection\r\nand you pay fifteen bob only. Then cOl11e vilh\r\nanother fifteen and ve kamp/itthe other, gaf1le shot,\r\neh?. \" ,\r\nI know bachelors who went for that o!!'tion of\r\ngetting half a dose of penicillin after paying fifteen\r\nbob. Then they vanished ta do what they called\r\n\"listening to themselves\" that is finding out haw the\r\nhalf dose of penicillin was treating them., If they\r\nfaund they were improving, they did not return to\r\nDr Patel.\r\nWhen such a charact.er faund the need to visit Dr\r\nPatel again, he went there under a new name\r\nbecause he did not wish the goad dactor to\r\nremember that he had not returned after paying\r\nfifteen bob only. He thaught that Dr Patel had the\r\nbrain of a Bombay goat but that was far from the\r\ntruth. When he saw a face once, he could not forget\r\nit sa when a fellaw went ta Dr Patel and lied abaut\r\nhis name, the man from Bombay pretended that he ~\r\nhad never seen him and proceeded ta prepare his\r\nequipment\u00b7 for injection with a lot of ceremony.\r\nThen he injected the fellow 'with samething that\r\ncould not cure what the fellow was suffering from.\r\nThis meant that the bachelor was not cured and\r\nhad to return to Dr Patel with his case now very\r\nserious. A certain part of his bady was now like a\r\nvolcana and so he paid the whole thirty bob and the\r\nman from Bombay said, \"My prend, vwai you get it\r\nall the time? Vwai not marry?\" Many bachelars did\r\nnot have any answer as to why they were being that\r\nfaolish.\r\nIt is many decades since the days of MB, Suta\r\nand Capsules and what was homa has now become\r\nsomething else. These days it does not send yau to\r\nDr Patel. It sends you into forgotten history\r\nbecause when it hits you, you become Rast tense. It\r\nall goes to say that there is every danger in being a\r\nbachelor since chances of getting to the age of the\r\nSon of the Soil are very slim if you have this idea\r\nthat you live in the days when Whispers was a\r\nyoung man.\r\nIt is also not funny being a bachelor boy because\r\neven the cost of buying the sins that will make you\r\npast tense is very high. It invalves such gifts as\r\nNakia or Siemens mobile phanes, meaning a major\r\ndent in the packet. In our days, it either cost ten\r\nbab for what you paid the street pharmacist or five\r\nbob, being the price of soda and the biscuits that\r\nyou baught far the girl who came visiting you.\r\nBE AFRAID: Over 200,000 Kenyans contract Aids\r\nevery year. Subsequently about 2.2 million Kenyans\r\nlive with HIV infection. Roughly 1.5 millian people\r\nhave died of Aids in Kenya since it was first\r\ndetected in the country. In the year 2000 alone,\r\nlS0,OOOpeople died .of Aids.\r\nnyaituga200J@yahoo.com, www.whis.com"}
