{"text": "Sunday Nation/ November 10,2002\r\nYOUNG WOMAN STEPS UP POETIC DRIVE AGAINST AIDS\r\n\r\nBY TONY MOCHAMA\r\nThe tall young woman strides the stage\r\nwith confidence and grace, her voice\r\nmelodic and passionate as she recites:-\r\n\"Let the word go forth, to friend and\r\nfoe alike, that it is a new day! Let T\r\nYoung woman steps up\r\npoetic drive against Aids\r\nthere be, in this place and elsewhere - no-one\r\nfaithless, no-one careless, no predator. ..\"\r\nHer name is Pamela Ateka and the predator she\r\nis fighting worldwide is Aids (Acquired\r\nImmuno-Deficiency Syndrome). Her crusade\r\nagainst the epidemic (said to have claimed at least\r\n24 million lives in sub-Saharan Africa) has taken\r\nAteka places, from the community-based\r\norganisation of dusty Kayole, Nairobi, to the\r\nconference halls of exotic Egypt.\r\nPamela has worked with HIV positive women in\r\nWOFAK (Women Fighting Aids in Kenya) and\r\nrubbed shoulders with the high, such as former\r\nSouth African President Nelson Mandela, and the\r\nmighty, like Mr J.P. Garnier, Chief Executive\r\nOfficer of GlaxoSmithKline.\r\nAnyone watching the special programme,\r\nStaying Alive, on the Barcelona Aids Conference in\r\nearly July (that was aired on Nation TV on\r\nKenyatta Day) would have recognised Pamela -\r\ntall, dark and smooth-skinned - as she listened\r\nintently to former American President Bill Clinton\r\neloquently state what needs to be done by the\r\nworld to fight the greatest predator of humanity in\r\nthe late 20th and early 21st Century.\r\nPamela's weapon of choice is her God-given\r\ntalents to create community awareness, not just\r\nabout the disease but also about other problems\r\n\"such as environmental and political malaise.\"\r\nShe adds: \"Poetry is my armoury against Aids,\r\nbut I also tell narrative oral tales to communicate\r\nagainst ethnic hatred and in-fighting.\"\r\nPrefer being told stories\r\nBut why use art - poetry and story-telling - to\r\ncommunicate her message instead of simply telling\r\nit as it is?\r\n\"We Africans prefer being told stories an'd\r\nvitendalVilis, as opposed to dry prose and hard\r\nfacts. By using poetry, my audiences find our\r\nanti-Aids messages easier to conceive, chew,\r\nswallow and digest.\"\r\nShe has been to several countries to represent\r\nher community of Urban Kayole - and to also\r\nspread the message that \"No carelessness + no\r\nfaithlessness = No Predator.\"\r\nFrom the beautiful capes of Cape Town (where\r\nshe met Mandela) to the dry and sunny\r\ndesert-scapes of Alexandria, where she attended a\r\nYouth Employment Summit, she has taken that\r\nmessage.\r\nPamela is grateful to the GTZ (German\r\nTechnical Co-operation) for the YES (Youth\r\nEmployment Summit) that\" was called to call for\r\nyouth action against global joblessness\".\r\nAfrica's problems, she says, are all inter-twinea,\r\nthe one blending into the other. \"We cannot discuss\r\nthem as separate entities or endemics.\"\r\nShe was a delegate at the last OAU policy\r\nmeeting convened to draft a plan of action against\r\nageing - although the Pandora's Box of Aids may,\r\nparadoxically, make longevity the least of Africa's\r\nAteka: \"Story-telling is effective\"\r\nAccording to\r\nClinton, scourge\r\nis the greatest\r\npredator of\r\nhumanity\r\nproblems.\r\nThe poetess has touched elbows with many\r\ninteresting and amusing fellows. They include\r\nrenowned CNN journalist Charles Hodgson and\r\nHollywood actor Rupert Everett (who played the\r\ngay guy, George, in the 1l)l)l) Julia Roberts\r\nmega-hit, My Best Friend's Wedding).\r\nIn one of life's unhappy coincidences, Everett,\r\n2X, actually happens to be gay in real-life, an\r\nanti-Aids activist and one of Pamela's favourite\r\npersonalities.\r\nWhile praising the countrywide VCT initiative\r\n(Voluntary Counselling and Testing centres),\r\nPamela would rather the campaign shifted more to\r\ninfected and affected people leading positive\r\nlifestyles as opposed to local celebrities blandly\r\ntelling the youth that maisha itaklllVa poa (life will\r\nbe fine) once you have discovered your status.\r\nPamela says: \"VCTs are relying on the idea tha\r\npeople want to know their status so that they do\r\nnot spread the disease, but with most HIV positive\r\npeople in Africa unable to afford three square\r\nmeals a day, with most of them unemployed or\r\nbeing re-trenched shortly after they fall sick, with\r\nthe stigma and discrimination that come with the\r\nAids, there is very little incentive to go find out\r\none's status.\"\r\nIt is the gravity of this problem that brought\r\nPamela (and 200 others from all over the world)\r\nface-to-face with Mr Clinton at the Barcelona Aids\r\nconference in July.\r\nPamela says: \"Clinton was very eloquent about\r\nthe Aids problem, very knowledgeable. He showed\r\nhow it is not only a sub-Saharan tragedy but one on\r\nthe Indian sub-continent, too. Clinton raised the\r\nalarm on the explosive threat Aids poses to China,\r\nRussia and Cuba, the way all the world's\r\nhemispheres are under a fierce threat.\"\r\nThe former US President urged Western\r\ngovernments and multi-national pharmaceuticals to\r\nwake up fully to the danger of Aids and do more,\r\nin pricing, aid and research-and-development, for\r\npoorer nations.\r\nMr Clinton may have been polished in his\r\npassion but it was the grand old statesman of\r\nAfrica, Mandela, who won Pamela's heart in past\r\nFebruary.\r\nA poignant story\r\nSays she: \"I was down in Cape Town to discuss\r\n'Human Rights and HIV status'. Mandela was\r\ncharismatic, mesmerising. He told us a poignant\r\nstory of a young lady whom he helped support\r\nthrough high school and college, who recently died\r\nof Aids.\"\r\nThe Kenyan anti-Aids crusader's own passion is\r\npartially fuelled by the death from the scourge of\r\nher elder sister, at only 30.\r\nPamela's eyes cloud over as she recalls her\r\nsister's final days ... a hunched little figure on a\r\nwoven mat on a bare floor. She often massaged her\r\ninto the small hours in a futile attempt to ease the\r\npain coursing through her frail body.\r\nDuring the interview with Lifestyle at Maision\r\nFrancaise, Nairobi, Pamela recalled those dark\r\ndays with a load of sadness.\r\nThis may be the end of day but the beginning of\r\nhope if all people realised, as Pamela has, that\r\nalthough not necessarily infected, we are all\r\naffected in one way or the other by the worst\r\nplague to ever plague humanity - since the\r\nLondon rats of 1666 and the Spanish Flu of 1922.\r\n\"We must fight it with all we got,\r\nbare-knuckled,\" Pamela says. Her knuckle-dusters,\r\nThe famous actor sees the Church as part of the it seems, are lines of poetry."}
