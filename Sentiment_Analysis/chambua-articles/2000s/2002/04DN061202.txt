train teachers on Aids
By NATION Correspondent
T eachers in primary schools are to
be trained in HlViAids educa
tion in a two-year project spon
sored by US Peace Corps.
The project’s volunteers will focus
more on rural areas, US Charge
d’Affaires, Mr William Brencick said.
He said chat was part of the assistance
his government has been offering to the
ministries of Education and Labour in
the fight against the scourge.
‘4True development is about helping
people to help themselves, it is not
about how much money one can bring
to the people,” he said.
Mr Brencick, who was accompanied by
senior government officials, presided
over the swearing-in ceremony of 23
volunteers who will be assigned duties
in different parts of the country.
He said thc peace corps comprised peo
ple of different careers and walks of
life who would make a difference in
various communities.
A difference could be made in turning
the tide so Kenyans could have skills to
contribute to economic growth, he said.
I pose a challenge to you to join hands
in helping Kenyan communities to fight
the greatest development challenge.
that is, l-HVIAids.
The government has already declared it
a national disaster which is robbing
Kenya of its most precious resource,”
he told the volunteers.
Mr Brencick urged the volunteers to
help Kenyans to start and better man
age businesses by improving the quality
of their products, strengthening the
marketing links.
Labour Permanent Secretary Joshua
Terer said the volunteer scheme had
contributed immensely to poverty alle
viation by establishing revolving funds
to help improve credit access in rural
communities.
He said it had increased people’s
incomcs by employing them and creat
¡ng markets, including the African
Growth and Opporturnty Act
(AGOA).
