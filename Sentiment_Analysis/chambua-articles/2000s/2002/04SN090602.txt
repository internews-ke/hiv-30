Thousands of children in Coast Prov
ince yesterday flocked to the Kwale dis.
lnct showground for the inauguration
of the Day of the African Child to be
celebrated in a week’s time.
The ceremony was charactensed by
traditional dances and recitation of
poems and speeches which were set to
commemorate the 1976 massacre of
children in South Africa.
The acting director of children servic
es, Mis Margaret Buyela, said the gov
ernment would deal with anybody
exploiting children following the
enactment of the Children’s Bill in
March.
Education minister Henry Kosgey
said the government had sound strat
egies to enhance education but was
hampered by outdated cultural
beliefs and a breakdown of moral
values, “which has led to the promo
tion of gender discrimination and the
spread of HIV/Aids pandemic”.
In a speech read on his behalf by
the Coast provincial director of edu
cation, Mrs Khadija Karim, the mm
ister said the African Heads of State
and Government meeting in Addis
Ababa recently declared June 16 the
Day of the African child.
