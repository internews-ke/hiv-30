{"text": "\ufeffSunday Nation /June 23, 2002\r\n\r\nPut your house in order first, says IMF boss\r\n\r\nBy JACINTA OCHIENG and CAROL NYAKUNDI\r\nAfrica is doomed without good\r\ngovernance and sound economic and\r\neducation policies. international\r\nMonetary Fund Country Represenlative\r\nSamuel Itam said yesterday.\r\n\u201cThese policies are bound to be\r\nrewarded with greater access to\r\ninternational markets, higher\r\ninvestment inflows, stronger economic\r\ngrowth and more jobs.\u201d\r\nAddressing guests at the 24th\r\ngraduation\r\nceremony of the\r\nUnited States\r\nInternational\r\nUniversity (USIU) in\r\nNairobi, Mr. Itam said\r\neducation must\r\nbe given top priority in the war against\r\npoverty.\r\n\u201cAn economy cannot develop its\r\nnatural resources effectively without\r\ndeveloping its human capital through\r\neducation. It is. therefore, important\r\nthat the mix of education output accords\r\nwell with the economy\u2019s prevailing and\r\nprospective production structures,\u201d he\r\nsaid.\r\nThe HIV-Aids pandemic. \u2022poor\r\ngovernance, resource mismanagement\r\narid globalisation were the challenges\r\nfacing Africa in the 21st Century.\r\n\u201cThese are daunting challenges and\r\nunless we face them squarely and\r\nresolutely, Africa will continue to lag\r\nbehind the rest of the world in terms of\r\neconomic development.\r\n\u201cWe in Africa know we cannot beat\r\nglobalisation, therefore, we should, and\r\nwill, join the process wholeheartedly.\r\nThis will be a difficult task but one\r\nwhich can be accomplished, provided\r\npolicymakers in Africa and the\r\ninternational community are ready to\r\nplay their respective parts.\u201d\r\nHe said globalisation had brought\r\nconsiderable economic benefits, in\r\ngeneral, but marginalised countries\r\nwithout proper development policies.\r\nMr ham asked African leaders to\r\ntake advantage of the New Partnership\r\nfor Africa\u2019s Development (Nepad), an\r\ninitiative aimed at reducing poverty in\r\nthe region. Developed countries should\r\nopen up their markets to African\r\ncountries without conditions, he added.\r\n\u2018Integration into the global economy\r\nmust be allowed by the developed\r\ncountries by permitting greater global\r\nspecialisalion.\r\n\u201cLconomic and social development\r\nin Africa is hindered by a high degree\r\nof economic and political uncertainty,\r\nstructural rigidities, high transaction\r\ncosts, cumbersome administrative\r\nprocedures and weak governance.\u201d he\r\nsaid,\r\nMr 11am appealed to the developed\r\nworld to allow benefits to spread to\r\nAfrica through partnership rather than\r\npatronage.\r\nTo African governments. Mr Itam\r\nasked for sound macroeconomics\r\npolicies, good governance, improved\r\nexpenditure management, efficient\r\nlegal and financial institutions and\r\nprice liberalisation.\r\nThe USIU Chancellor, Dr Freida\r\nBrown, said the institution had 2,500\r\nstudents. 53 per cent of them female.\r\nThe university\u2019s retention rate was\r\nover 80 per cent. \u201cThis percentage\r\nranks us with the highly selective\r\nuniversities like Harvard and\r\nStanford.\u201d\r\nDr Brown added: \u201cOur applicants\r\nfor the upcoming Fall quarter have\r\ndoubled and we have had to move\r\ntoward meritorious admission for some\r\nprogrammes.\u201d"}
