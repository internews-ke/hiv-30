{"text": "\ufeffSunday Nation! June 23, 2002\r\nOxana on worldwide campaign against HIV\r\n\r\nCONTINUED FROM PAGE 2\r\n\r\nthe murky gutters of Kibera slums. Two kilometres\r\nshe covered on foot. No strutting nor swinging her\r\nback. The simple police trot; fast and sporty but\r\nperfectly well managed.\r\nLove, mercy, pity, peace and helping those in\r\nneed.\r\nSo her lunch she forfeited for the love of the\r\nAids-orphaned children of Imani Children's\r\nHome, also at Kayole. The children, too, were\r\ntouched, and showered her with grateful songs,\r\ndance and poems.\r\nOxana was touched, dipped her generous hands\r\nin her bag and dished out a wad of dollar bills for\r\nthe children. Probably they can have lunch tomorrow,\r\ntoo.\r\nIt was Oxana's first encounter with HIV-Aids\r\nvictims in her life, and she had better get used to\r\nthis routine.\r\nAs Miss Universe, she is going to be an ambassador\r\nagainst HlV-Aids for one year. Theresa Beyer,\r\nvice-president of the Miss Universe Organisation\r\nin New York, is with her on the Nairobi trip, and\r\nsays Oxana will spend a year working on the HIVAids\r\ncampaign.\r\nYear-long worldwide campaign\r\n\"She will be raising funds, creating awareness, talking\r\nto the pharmaceutical companies, talking to\r\nwomen around the world.\"\r\nOxana could have chosen to go back home to\r\nsee her parents after she was crowned Miss Universe,\r\nbut she decided to first come to Kenya to\r\nkick off her year-long worldwide campaign against\r\nHIV-Aids.\r\nTrouble for her boyfriend, St Petersburg businessman\r\nVladimir? Not quite, he's not been\r\nditched. But Oxana will hardly have time for him\r\nthis year.\r\nary Hilliard McMillan, the Miss Universe\r\npublic relations officer, said the\r\nbeauty queen still loves him very much\r\nbut for the next year or so her focus\r\nwill be completely different. \"She has no plans to\r\nmarry or engage herself in a relationship of any\r\nkind at this time\".\r\nBut Oxana remains the same passionate, kindhearted\r\nperson. \"I've not changed and I'll not\r\nchange. I'm the same person I used to be,\" she said\r\nin an intervi~w with Lifestyle.\r\nPassion for the lowly and the wretched\r\nThe Miss Universe Organisation in collaboration\r\nwith Global Health Council and Kenya's National\r\nAids Control Council and their associates had\r\nmade prior arrangements for Miss Universe to visit\r\nKenya after the beauty pageant, which was held in\r\nPuerto Rico one month ago.\r\nLike the late Mother Teresa of Calcutta, Miss\r\nUniverse has a passion for the lowly and wretched.\r\nAt the Imani Children's Home, she cuddled\r\nbaby Grace Wachuka with greater passion than the\r\npoor mother who abandoned the newborn two\r\nmonths ago.\r\nThe Imani founder, Ms Faith Wanjiru, did not\r\nmeet her special guest; she had gone to fend for\r\nher children who know her as Mama.\r\nAs she crisscrossed Nairobi's Eastlands and\r\n~uthlands on a trip to see the wretched of the\r\n.......-earth, the people on her route were curious.\r\n\"In which car is Miss Universe?\" asked a group\r\nof Kibera slum dwellers hurrying to catch a\r\nglimpse of her. She was in a celebrity maroon,\r\nfour-wheel-drive Toyota jeep. Here she toured a\r\nproject by Kibera Community Self-Help Programme,\r\nheaded by Mrs Ann Owiti.\r\nOxana's handshake is a heartwarming grip, a\r\ntight clutch and not a superficial tough.\r\nDarkness cut short her day\r\nWhen darkness cut short her day, she decided to\r\nwave away her feelings on the children making her\r\nfeel so longing to come again.\r\nOxana visited one of Africa's leading study centres\r\nfor children with HlV-Aids. She met her\r\nmatch at Nyumbani Children's Home, lO-year-old\r\nLaura Poshel or Miss Nyumbani. They stroke and\r\nstrolled hand-in-hand.\r\nFaces were lit with excitement at Nyumbani\r\nChildren's Home as Oxana took a blood test for\r\nHIV-Aids. Want to know her status? \"The results\r\ncan be sent to her in no time,\" said Mr Musa Ali,\r\na paramedic working at the home.\r\nNyumbani Children's Home in Karen looks\r\nafter 79 abandoned children, and takes care of\r\nanother 500 who are on an outreach programme\r\nthat caters for Nairobi's slum areas.\r\nSisters of the Blessed Sacrament from India\r\nlook after the children at the home, which was\r\nfounded by Fr Angelo D'Agostino in September,\r\n1992.\r\nWhen Miss Universe flies out of Kenya on\r\nTuesday night, she will be flying with deep feelings\r\nfrom Nairobi's children in her heart.\r\nFor winning the crown in Puerto Rico a month\r\nago, Oxana will take home prizes worth about\r\n$250,000, in addition to promotional contracts and\r\na two-year scholarship to The School for Film and\r\nTelevision in New York. She will spend a year in\r\nNew York on a salary and is provided with a luxury\r\nriverside apartment.\r\nCrown of diamonds and pearls\r\n\"I feel good. I haven't been this happy in a long\r\ntime,\" Oxana said last month as last year's queen,\r\nPuerto Rican Denise Quinones, placed a $250,000\r\ncrown of diamonds and pearls on her head. \"This\r\nis the first time my country has won.\"\r\nMiss Panama, Justine Pasek, 22, won first\r\nrunner-up. Next year's pageant will be in Panama.\r\nMiss China, 19-year-old Ling Zhuo won second\r\nplace. It was the first time China sent a contestant.\r\nMiss South Africa, 22-year-old Vanessa Carreira,\r\ntook third place."}
