 What of internal democracy?
        ent matter.
 T      alking about democracy is easy. Practising democracy, as
        the opposition parties are finding out, is a totally differ-
    It requires moral strength and a willingness to pay the price.
 The cost of ideals, in emotional material terms, is more often
 than not, high.
    The lesson from the nominations across the board this week
 is that the political parties are willing to talk democracy, but
 none is willing to walk the talk.
    The fact of the matter is that the people who hold sway in
 Kanu, Narc and Ford-P, did not see it fit to subject themselves
 to party primaries. They did so either by cowing their oppo-
 nents, using underhand means to disqualify others or to issue
 "direct nomination" from party headquarters.
    There have been a lot of excuses for this. Some say that can-
 didates needed to be freed to focus on the presidential cam- ,
 paigns; others were said to be key to the presidential cam-
 paigns; in other cases there was no explanation at all, other
