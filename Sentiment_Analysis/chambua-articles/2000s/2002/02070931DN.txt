Use of treated nets is one                                                             cockroaches, bed\r\n              component in the Global Malaria Control Strategy that                                                              bugs and sand\r\n          The strategy advocates four technical measures: sustainable                                                           flies\r\n      preventive measures such as the use of insecticide treated mosquito             A PSI team promotes ITNs in rural Kenya\r\n      nets, early diagnosis and treatment, early detection and prevention of\r\n      epidemics, and strengthening local research capacities.\r\n           In Kenya, efforts are being made to promote the use of nets as an\r\n      effective way of controlling malaria. These efforts particularly target\r\n      the most vulnerable groups - children under five years and pregnant\r\n      women. The two groups are particularly susceptible to malaria.\r\n      Children under five years account for over 1)0 per cent of the deaths\r\n      due to malaria worldwide.\r\n           Specifically, treated nets are crucial to combating the disease, since\r\n      malaria-transmitting        mosquitoes are largely active at night, when\r\n      people are asleep.\r\n           In Kenya, the culprit vector is the female of the species Anopheles\r\n      Gamhiae. These human-biting species feed indoors, an activity that\r\n      reaches its peak between IOpm and 4 am.\r\n          This means use of treated nets can provide protection from\r\n      infective bites. Various studies have shown that use of treated nets\r\n      reduces mortality bctween 2S and 40 per cent, and hospital\r\n      admissions due to malaria by almost half.\r\n           Presently, families spend a lot of income on anti-malarial drugs,\r\n       insecticide sprays, coils and other prevention methods.\r\n           In a study done in Western Kenya, it was found that over a\r\n       four-week period, households using insecticide-treated         nets spent on\r\n      average Shl) on malaria treatment while those who don't use these\r\n       nets spent an average ShSX over the same period.\r\n           When nets are treated with an insecticide, they give the users\r\n       double protection. Not only are mosquitoes repelled when they\r\n      approach, they arc also killed if they come into contact with the net.\r\n       Moreover, the insecticide also kills other noxious insects such as lice,\r\n      cockroaches, bed bugs and sand flies.\r\n           Experts recommend that the nets be re-treated with insecticide\r\n       before the onset of the rainy season.\r\n           However, the use of treated nets is not as widespread as might be\r\n       desired. This is because, neither nets nor the required insecticides are\r\n       widely available or affordable in most communities.\r\n           Population Services International (PSI), a social marketing\r\n       organisation, intends to increase use of insecticide treated (ITN) in\r\n       Kenya. It wants to improve on the level of household ownership of\r\n       nets which stands at a paltry IS per cent countrywide.\r\n           The NGO intends to bring the treated nets within IS minutes' walk\r\n       for people living in malaria endemic areas.\r\n           With assistance from USAID and DFID, PSI markets the nets for\r\n       malaria prevention, hormonal contraceptives for family planning and\r\n       condoms for HIV Aids prevention.\r\n            Recently, the organisation launched an ITN called SlIpanel and an\r\n       insecticide retreatment kit called !'OIverlah, which are now available\r\n       locally.\r\n            PSI plans to increase the availability and affordability of ITNs by\r\n       getting shops, dukas, supermarkets and other traders to stock the\r\n        nets. It will also conduct education campaigns so that people know\r\n       where to buy the ITNs. This will raise public awareness on the\r\n        importance of sleeping under ITNs and the need for regularly treating\r\n        the nets.\r\n           The campaign's overall goal would be improved supply and\r\n        promotion of mosquito nets by Kenyan manufacturers, and increased\r\n       demand by consumers for better prevention of malaria.\r\n            \"To get the communities to be pro-active in protecting themselves,\r\n        we have to work on misconceptions regarding how malaria is\r\n        transmitted and the effectiveness of ITNs\", says Dana Tilson, ITN\r\n       Technical Advisor at PSI. \"Effective messages will help create\r\n        demand.\"\r\n            Social marketing has become an important way to deliver needed\r\n        health products to low income people in developing countries, and to\r\n        motivate the use of these products .\r\n.           The products, procured from international suppliers, are\r\nl~distributed          through existing commercial distribution networks. They\r\n        ar~ branded and packaged locally and sold at subsidised, affordable\r\n        prices.\r\n            Commercial marketing techniques together with public education\r\n        are employed to motivate the use of the products. However, these are\r\n        sold at cost and no profit made to them.\r\n            In Kenya, the majority of those who know the benefits of\r\n        insecticide treated nets are those who live in urban areas and can\r\n        afford to buy a relatively expensive net at commercial prices. Even\r\n        when nets and insecticides arc available, demand is limited by low\r\n        levels of knowledge regarding malaria prevention and the benefits of\r\n         ITNs.\r\n            For poor peopie, especially in rural areas, high prices and '\r\n        availability are major obstaclcs to obtaining ITNs.\r\n            PSI's campaign is aimed at helping overcome some of these\r\n        challenges. Increasing the number of households owning nets is a\r\n        major challenge, but. unless people use treated ncts correctly and\r\n        consistently, the rate of malaria deaths and illness will not be reduced\r\n        substantially.\r\nPage \f\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------Trial Version-----------------------\r\n\r\nConvert PDF to Text Desktop Software.\r\n\r\nCopyright Convertpdftotext.net 2014.\r\n\r\nTo remove these lines, please activate your software from http://www.convertpdftotext.net/buynow.htm\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------"}
