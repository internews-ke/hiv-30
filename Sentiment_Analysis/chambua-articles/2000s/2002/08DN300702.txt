Aids: NCCK idea a loser
    the confidentiality  of HIV -positive patients.
      is disappointing that the National Council of Churches of
       t
I   Kenya (NCCK) should think of asking doctors to break
   Far from being a solution to the pandemic, the proposal,
coming out of the regional conference of the council's
members, clearly manifests just how far Kenyans still have to
go before we can come to terms with HIV/Aids - let alone
negotiate solutions.
   The council must not forget that HIV-positive people
have human rights - and that the greater majority of them
are neither promiscuous nor criminals. Why discriminate
against those with HIV and not the ones with other sexually
transmitted diseases? Shall we also go ahead and isolate
those suffering from infectious diseases such as tuberculosis,
leprosy, whooping cough or even the common flu?
   To suggest that everyone with HIV must have their private
history posted out on public notice boards, as it were, is to
claim a moral high ground that no one but God has the right
to.
    Whereas it is necessary for Kenyans to speak out publicly
about HIV/Aids, the battle will not be won by
holier-than-thou       pronouncements.     The disease may have a
knock-on effect in the lives of all Kenyans, but it is unlikely
that such proposals will stop people in their tracks and                                                                    GUNS OF AUGUST 0 MACHARIA GAITHO

    It is not as if the majority of Kenyans are not already
aware of the hows and whys of HIV /Aids. What we expect of
