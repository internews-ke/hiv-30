          veteran leader Robert Mugabe is a badly-need-
          inally, some good news from Zimbabwe. The
 F        swearing-in of Mr Morgan Tsvangirai as Prime
          Minister in a power-sharing arrangement with
 ed shot in the arm for a country that has been in po-
 litical turmoil for a considerable period.
    From the time Zimbabweans went to the polls on
 March 29, 2008, the country has not had a fully func-
 tioning government.
    True, Mr Mugabe declared himself the winner after
 Mr Tsvangirai boycotted the second round of the poll
 in June last year, but it was clear that even the most
 ardent supporters of the ruling Zanu-PF party knew
 the only way out of the crisis was a power-sharing ar-
 rangement.
    From a country that was the pride of southern Af-
 rica, Zimbabwe is now a country in which 70,000 peo-
 ple are suﬀering from cholera, with the death toll at
 3,500 so far, and thousands others in need of urgent
 food aid. It is also a country with the highest inﬂation
 rate in the world at 231 million per cent, and where
 vast tracts of fertile land lie fallow after Mr Mugabe
 appropriated by force land from white farmers.
    At the same time, millions of Zimbabweans have
 ﬂed to neighbouring South Africa and Botswana to
 escape the economic crisis spawned by Mr Mugabe’s
 dictatorial rule.
    It is obvious that a solution to the Zimbabwean cri-                                                         WHAT OTHERS SAY
