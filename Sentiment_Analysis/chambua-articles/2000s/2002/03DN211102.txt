WORLD REPORT LAUDS KENYA'S SCHOOL GAINS

By David Aduda 
Kenya is one of the few African countries
that has nearly achieved gender
equality in primary school enrolment.
It is also one of the few countries with
a high percentage of trained teachers -
95 per cent. Others are Mauritius, Tanzania,
Zambia, Swaziland, Niger and
Ethiopia.
A new global report on progress on
achieving education for all goal, EFA
. Global Monitoring Report 2002, which
was released last
week in London,
shows that Kenya
scores highly on
adult literacy programmes.
An estimated 82 per cent of the adult
population is literate. Six other countries
that have done well on adult literacy are
Equitorial Guinea, Congo, South Africa,
Zimbabwe and Namibia.
Despite Kenya's achievements, the
report shows that many children still
drop out of school, joining the ranks of
illiterate youth.
On average, about 40 per cent of
those enrolled in Standard One do not
complete the primary school cycle.
Published annually by Unesco, the
report says that unless checked, the
HIV/Aids pandemic is likely to reverse
the gains made in educiltion.
It says about 15 per cent of Kenyans
in the age bracket 15-49 are infected
with HIV. Many of those in schools and
colleges, as well as education workers,
are in this age range.
Some of the countries with high incidences
of HIV/Aids are Botswana (38
per cent) Lesotho (30), Zambia (21.5)
and Malawi (15).
"Many Aids-affected households,
which previously contributed cash and
other resources
for educational
programmes,
can no longer
do so," says the
report.
"The sickness,
poverty and hunger that the epidemic
has brou&ht have left .many rural communities
so weakened that they cannot
participate in self-help community aclivities
for school maintenance and
development. "
The report also shows that though
about 30 per cent of the government
expenditure goes to education, with ~rimary
taking 44.2 per cent of that figure,
many Kenyan children still drop out at
this level without acquiring basic reading,
writing and life skills:
