              The lEA recently published "The Lit le Fact-Book: A Socio Economic and Political Profile of Kenya's Districts". This book presents the Latest socio economic and political information by district.
              The book also presents information n issues around which the electorate may wish to question aspirants for political office. This is a short presentation of the main conclusions from 'The Little
              Fact Book' which is available at the EA. It is partly on the basis of its findings, that we are hosting a series of pub lie debates between all political parties to. obtain their policy responses to Kenya's
              development concerns.
