         She was impressed that Kenya's music trainers "have gone nation-

     they will use any other language. She cited a school from Eastern
      Province, which won with the Luhya lsukuti dance and a Rift Valley
      school with a Taarab dance.
         Mrs King had a word of praise for veteran music composers, such
      as, Dr Arthur Kemoli. "The use of indigenous languages ensures that
      our vernaculars do not become extinct on the path to modernisation.
         The Kenyan-born and educated Mrs King caused a stir when she
      left her armchair to show participants what they should have done.

      Travelling Fellowship, which enables 100 people to travel outside
       Britain every year to research on an area of personal interest.
