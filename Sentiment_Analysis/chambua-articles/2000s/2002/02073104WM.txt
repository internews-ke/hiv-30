{"text": "\ufeffDaily Nation/ July 31,2002\r\n\r\nTURNING ADVERSITY INTO A MISSION\r\nThe day of her husbands funeral, she learnt that he had died of AIDS\r\n\r\nOmukuba died in July last\r\nily put out a notice in the news-\r\nItuary pages with the international\r\nf compassion for Aids sufferers. It\r\nin Kenya, and even at his funeral,\r\nf Omukuba's death was openly\r\n\"to's widow, Jackline Namusia,\r\nAMBOKA OYAHO about how\r\nnews and her struggle to live\r\nar after burying her husband.\r\nThe words still bite. \"Do you know\r\nwhat killed your husband?\" the Red\r\nCross workers who had brought his\r\nbody home asked me. Why were they\r\nasking me sueh question, I wondered?\r\nAnd why now? Why did they\r\nnot just leave me alone to mourn? All I knew was\r\nthat my husband had been unwell and had died as a\r\nresult of illness.\r\nThen they dropped the bombshell: \"Aids,\" they\r\ntold me. \"Your husband was killed by HIV.\" I was\r\n. speechless. Even before the enormity of their words\r\ncould sink in, they began to advise me about the\r\nimplications of being infected with the virus that\r\ncauses Aids.\r\nIt all sounded incredible. But it had to be true,\r\nbecause everyone was speaking openly about it at\r\nthe funeral. Everything seemed to be happening so\r\nfast.\r\nI had met and fallen in love with Tito in August,\r\nIlJlJlJ, while staying with my sister at her marital\r\nhome in Eshirotsa, Khwisero constituency. He told\r\nme he had been working in Nairobi but the contract\r\nhad ended and he had decided to return to his rural\r\nhome.\r\nWe had been married for about a year when our\r\nson, Peter, was born in July 2000. At about that\r\ntime, my husband fell ill. He was taken to a hospital\r\nin the village, but his condition did not improve.\r\nSometimes, when he felt a little beller, he would go\r\nout to drink with his friends. At other times,\r\nthough, he was too weak to get out of bed.\r\nFarm work\r\nEventually, Tito's sister, Margaret, came and took\r\nhim away with her to Nairobi. I was left with my\r\nson, who was a month old then, and my mother-inlaw,\r\nwho was unwell. I kept myself busy looking\r\nafter them and with farm work, ,ind did not even\r\nthink to find out what Tito was suffering from. I\r\njust waited for him to get better and come back\r\nhome.\r\nWhile he was still undergoing treatment, his sister\r\nbrought him home. He wns still sickly. Whenever\r\nI enquired about his health, he became angry.\r\nSometimes he would tell me that he might\r\nrecover from what was ailing him, or he might die.\r\nHe was speaking in parables and I did not know\r\nwhat he meant. At other times he empathised with\r\nme, but I thought that was unnecessary since he was\r\nthe one who was sick. I. on the other hand. was\r\nfine, going about my chores as usual.\r\nBut on July lJ. 20t)) , exactly two years after we\r\nhad started living together as husband and wife,\r\nTito died. I still did not know what had killed him,\r\nand did not suspect anything, not until those Red\r\nCross workers told me the truth.\r\nThe events of that day still come to me like a bad\r\ndream. I didn't know much about Aids then. but\r\nevery time I looked into the innocent eyes of my\r\nson, I shed tears tears of hopelessness.\r\nAnd then things started to fall into place. When\r\nhe was seven months old, my son became anaemic\r\nand had to have a blood transfusion. It must have\r\nbeen as a result of his weak immunity. Some tests\r\nwere done on us, the baby and I. I guess one of the\r\ntests was for HIV, but the results were not disclosed\r\ntome.\r\nEven now. no one has really ever told me that I\r\nam HIV positive, but I know I am. I cough, I have\r\nbeen treated for tuberculosis, I have these skin\r\nrashes, surely I don't have to lie to myself that I\r\nescaped the disease. I look at my son and deep\r\ninside I wish that he turns HIV-negative arid lives\r\non to perpetuate our names.\r\nIt is now one year since Tito died. Although I\r\nhad only been married a short while, my sisters-inlaw\r\nsaid that I should stay on and they would take\r\ncare of me. Still, it has been a year of great pain for\r\nme. In September, about three months after Tito's\r\ndeath, my mother-in-law also passed away. I was\r\nsuddenly left alone with my son in the homestead. I\r\nbusied myself with farm work but when through\r\nwith the work, what else does one do? Thoughts of\r\nhow cruel life can be flooded my mind.\r\nNo more tears\r\nBut now. I don't cry any more. Why cry for what\r\nyou cannot change? The self-pity, the regrets, and.\r\nthe tears are gone. My sister-in-law Margnret, who\r\nnursed Tito until his demise. and I have made n\r\nresolution: together we must help young people to\r\navoid getting infected with HIV.\r\nSince Tito loved football, we arc using the game\r\nto sensitise young people to issues relating to Aids.\r\nWe have organised a soccer tournament in memory\r\nof my husband, and on August 10. I will be at\r\nEshirota Primary School cheering the tenms competing\r\nfor the trophy. I believe the tournament will\r\nencourage young people to come out and be tested\r\nfor HIV/Aids.\r\nI feel for women who may find themselves in the\r\nsituation in which I found myself. I passionately\r\nappeal to them to go for testing before becoming\r\nsexually involved with anyone. There is no point in\r\ncrying later over what you could have avoided.\r\n. Those alrendy infected should not look to \"spread\r\nit\", as this will expose them to the risk of \u00b7reinfection.\r\nInstead, they must seek to live positively.\r\nThere arc men who claim that Tito was\r\nbewitched and we just claimed that he died of Aids\r\nso that they don't come for me. I look at them and I\r\nfeel so sad, that with all the information available.\r\nabout Aids still peqple want to endanger their lives.\r\nThe only person who gives me courage to live\r\neach day is my son."}
