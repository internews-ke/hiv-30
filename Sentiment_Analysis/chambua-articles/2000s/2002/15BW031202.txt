        F              of Kenya's tea estates, Aids is stalking Africa's dreams of
                      an economic renaissance.
                         As the countries around the world marked World Aids
         increasingly spurring the continent's business leaders to take the lead
         in fighting and treating the disease ..
             With some 30 million Africans infected, millions expected to die in
         the coming years and billions qf dollars:being wiped off the economic:
         ledger, they can hardly afford not to.
             "Companies have beGome increasingly aware that offering preven-
         tion and health care costs them \0 time§ less than losing skilled
         employees to Aids," said Mr Mamoudou Diallo, UNAids country
         adviser for Ivory Coast.                    '
             UN officials say the spread of Aids could derail the New Partner-
         ship for Africa's Development (Nepad), the ambitious multi-billion
         dollar development drive which AfricanJeaders hope will finally cure
         the continent's economic malaise.
             "What is happening is a direct challenge to Nepad, and to every-
         thing that Africa wants to achieve," Mr Stephen Lewis, the UN envoy
         for HIV/Aids in Africa, said. "Unless you deal with the disease, you
         will never get economic growth.
            That's a lesson not lost on Africa's business community, which is
                                                rushing to put battle plans in
