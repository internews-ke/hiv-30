We must be ready to cough up any amount if we\r\nknow that its long-run benefits will far outweigh that amount.\r\n   But we do not know. Nay, what we do know tends to\r\naffirm just the opposite. It is that the Government has\r\nappointed many \"anti-corruption\" squads before only to\r\nfrustrate their work.\r\n   The only difference is that the present squad comes from a\r\nWestern country. This is likely to be intended to impress the\r\nmany of us forever convinced that real expertise - anything\r\nthat works - can only come from the Anglo-Saxon world.\r\n   It is from that world, too, that we hope to receive massive\r\n\"aid\". Thus any non-Westerner who favours the services of\r\none of that world's own is the one most likely to impress Mr\r\nMoneybags in Washington DC into greater \"generosity\". But\r\nit would be extremely short-sighted and dangerous.\r\n   For, as we say, our Government has never convinced many\r\nKenyans that it is genuinely ready to tackle corruption. And\r\nKenyans' is probably a misplaced hope. For here what we are\r\ntalking about is official corruption.
