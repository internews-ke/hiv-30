GRUMBLES OVER MINISTERS NEW RECIPE
Opposition MPs dismissed Finance
Minister Chris Obure's budget
proposals as an election gimmick
impossible to implement while those in
Kanu described it as the best ever.
Shadow Finance Minister David
Mwiraria said the removal of import
duty on agricultural raw materials and
fertiliser was positive but added that the
poor would be hardest-hit by tax on
kerosene.
The government's plan to revive the
stalled Kenya Meat Commission was
described as the "best gimmick" to woo
voters from pastoralist communities.
Former Finance Minister Chris
Okemo said the minister "walked a
tightrope" in trying to come up with a
budget that did not anticipate donor
support.
With a shrinking tax base and lack of
donor support, he said, the minister
would have no choice but to continue
borrowing from the local market to
meet the budget deficit of Sh37 billion.
Prof Anyang' Nyong'o described the
Budget as simplistic and dwelling on
petty issues. Said the Social Democratic
Party nominated MP: "The minister
should have thought big. He should
have spelt out measures to get the
thousands of unemployed
youth into the information
technology industry."
Ford Kenya chairman
Michael Wamalwa
described it as "toQ
optimistic". The minister
failed to spell out the
specific measures he would
take to give farmers the
incentive to produce, Mr Wamalwa said.
Mr Njeru Kathangu (Ford-A,
Runyenjes) welcomed moves to revive
the textile industry and address
HIV/Aids.
Dr Newton Kulundu (Ford-K,
Lurambi) said most of the money
proposed for HIV /Aids awareness
programmes should have gone into
purchase of drugs.
The chairman of the Kenya Business
Council, Mr Wilfred Kiboro, said that
the Budget did not show any
commitment on the part of the
government to alleviate poverty and
create employment.
Mr Kiboro, the immediate former
chairman of the Federation of Kenya
Employers, predicted that more
Kenyans would be poorer next year in
spite of the two per cent economic
growth rate projected by the Minister
for Finance.
"It's difficult to understand how
companies can grow in a shrinking
economy that grows at two per cent
while the population rate is growing at
three per cent," Mr Kiboro said.
He said that the minister had failed
state how he would reduce government
expenditure and address the Sh30
billion budget deficit experienced last
financial year. .
"There is not effort to restructure the
public service and address the budget
deficit," Mr Kiboro added .
"The slapping of VAT on mobile
phone communication is just going for an
easy option at a time when the cost of
phones is already to high because land
lines are not readily available.
"The two per cent growth rate that the
government is projecting shows that they
are running out of ideas. Why should we
target a two per cent growth rate when
our neighbours are targeting a six to
eight per cent growth rate?" Mr Kiboro
posed during an interview.
He criticised the increase of duty on
kerosene for targeting the poor and
termed in "insensitive."
However, the council chairman
welcomed the zero-rating of import duty
on raw materials and capital equipment
for manufacturers.
On the injection by the government of
Sh300 million in micro-finance for the
agricultural sector, Mr Kiboro said that it
was a good sign but insufficient for a
sector that contributes 25 per cent of the
Gross Domestic Product.
He added that the scrapping of import
duty on imported timber was insincere.
"By adding tax on kerosene, the poor
will destroy the environment by using
firewood as fueL"
But East African Legislative Assembly
member Mohammed
Zubedi (Kenya)
supported the
proposals and asked
leaders to help the
minister implement
them.
National Party of
Kenya leader Charity
Ngilu dismissed it as
an unrealistic "campaign budget".
Mr Ochillo Ayacko (Kanu, Rongo)
welcomed the exclusion of donors in this
year's Budget.
Mr Peter 0100 Aringo (Alego Usonga,
Kanu), said the Budget Speech was
"ritualistic". He added: "It is not the first
time the government has promised it was
going to revive the KMC. Why should we
believe it now?"
Sugar cane farmers in Nyanza and
Western provinces said the Budget failed
to address their plight. They singled out a
provision slapping a 100 per cent duty on
sugar imported from Comesa members.
They dismissed as too lenient the
more.-than-200,000 metric tonnes duty
benchmark. Besides, they argued, the
minister was silent on punitive measures
against unscrupulous traders who
connived to import less than 200,000
metric tonnes separately to dodge the
'lOOper cent duty.
Several hoteliers in Kisumu,
Kakamega, Bungoma and Busia
welcomed the duty waiver on imported
furniture for upgrading touristic facilities.
There will also be no duty on imported
nets and incidental gear.
