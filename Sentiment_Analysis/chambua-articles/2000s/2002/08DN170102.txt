                 British team President Moi has hired to help his
M                money the taxpayer is likely to pay the three-man
Government to deal effectively with official corruption.
   But what is Sh60 million the experts are likely to pocket in
three months against the billions the the same taxpayer loses
to public officials during the same period?
   If the team will deliver the goods, then money should be
no object. We must be ready to cough up any amount if we
know that its long-run benefits will far outweigh that amount.
   But we do not know. Nay, what we do know tends to
affirm just the opposite. It is that the Government has
appointed many "anti-corruption" squads before only to
frustrate their work.
   The only difference is that the present squad comes from a
Western country. This is likely to be intended to impress the
many of us forever convinced that real expertise - anything
that works - can only come from the Anglo-Saxon world.
   It is from that world, too, that we hope to receive massive
"aid". Thus any non-Westerner who favours the services of
one of that world's own is the one most likely to impress Mr
Moneybags in Washington DC into greater "generosity". But
it would be extremely short-sighted and dangerous.
   For, as we say, our Government has never convinced many
Kenyans that it is genuinely ready to tackle corruption. And
Kenyans' is probably a misplaced hope. For here what we are
talking about is official corruption.                                                                                                                                                                                  JOHN MBARIA
