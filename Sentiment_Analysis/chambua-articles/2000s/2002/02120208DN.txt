It is not clear that their\r\n  exual behaviour has changed noticeably in that year, or that\r\n  he purported decline will make a dent on HIV /Aids\r\n  lrevalence.\r\n     During the United Nations World Aids Day marked\r\n  \u00b7esterday, it was learnt that only 10 per cent of Kenyans are\r\n  fIV positive, translating into 2.2 million, while 1.5 million\r\n  lave already died. These are not small figures by any\r\n  eckoning, and although the Government attributes the\r\n  ninuscule decline to an \"aggressive anti-Aids campaign\r\n  mdertaken by the Government and non-governmental\r\n. lrganisations\", just how aggressive this campaign has been\r\n  emains to be seen .\r\n   . A clear pointer that Kenyans should take these figures\r\n  vith a grain of salt are reports from the provinces. One\r\n  :xample should suffice. In Nyeri alone, at least 40 per cent of\r\n  hose who go for HIV tests - voluntary or not - are testing\r\n  lositive. And yet Nyeri District is not the most heavily hit by\r\n  his epidemic. Districts like Thika, and many areas of Nyanza\r\n  .re a lot more affected.\r\n     We ought not to be concerned about the state of the rest of\r\n  he world, but startling statistics are coming to light.
