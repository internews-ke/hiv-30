  Aids drugs
  shortage
  dangerous
  for patients
  By Mike Mwaniki
  The frequent shortages of Aids drugs is
  endangering the lives of patients, health
  experts warn.
     Guaranteed drug supply is crucial in
  antiretroviral treatment as correct dos-
  age and rigorous adherence to schedul-
  ing are needed for the medicines to
  work successfully.
     Experts warn that patients who fail to
  closely adhere to their treatment run a
  higher chance of developing drug-
  resistant strains of HIV.
     The Kenya Coalition For Access to
  Essential Medicines on Tuesday accused
  drug companies of "deliberately" per-
  puating the persistent shortages of dis-
  counted antiretroviral drugs in the local
  market.
     According to the coalition - which
  has been tracking the shortages for
  almost a year - a pattern of regular
                       shortages is emerging

     During this period, six of the seven
  hospitals reported they were either com- _
  pletely out of stock (and had been for
  between two to six months) or had             Circumcision and cancer
  experienced irregular supply or short-
  ages at some time over the last year.
     According to the Coalition, these
  shortages are unacceptable given the
