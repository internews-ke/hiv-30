{"text": "\ufeffSunday Nation/ September 1, 2002\r\n\r\nSuffering of the body, purifying of the soul\r\nBy JOE BABENDRIEIR\r\n \r\nHer eyes stared at the wall in front of her as if\r\nshe were contemplating eternity. The woman sat\r\noutside the hospital room where her husband\r\nwas dying of Aids. She was staring at death -\r\nher own. It was a look any hospital worker\r\nknows all too well. Before the year was over, it\r\nwas her turn. Her last breath turned her only\r\nchild into an orphan.\r\nIf we can find a cure for Aids, we should. But\r\nthat will be too late for millions. Is their suffering\r\nin vain? The substance of a recent letter to\r\nthe editor put a new perspective on the question\r\nposed to Jesus Christ by his disciples: \"Will only\r\na few be saved?\"\r\nWill only a few manage to get through life without\r\nhorrible suffering? Are the ones who escape\r\nsuffering better off? And which ones make it to\r\nheaven? Are suffering and salvation connected\r\nin some mysterious way? These are the questions\r\nfor which we need answers.\r\n\r\nSimple but striking insight\r\nThe letter from this reader was especially provocative.\r\nShe opened her heart on this difficult\r\nsubject and said: \"We all would like to go to\r\nheaven because we dread hell. But sin is attractive\r\nand has the power to lure us all.\" Her\r\ninsight is simple but striking. Isn't it true that lots\r\nof people look at heaven merely as an escape\r\nfrom damnation? For some people, living an\r\nupright life seems impossible. Their life is a kind\r\nof hell. They must feel like Mary Magdalene\r\nbefore she met Jesus, when she was possessed by\r\nseven devils.\r\nYes, sin does lure us. This seems to be Jesus's\r\nanswer to the question about how many will be\r\nsaved. He said: \"Try your best to enter by the\r\nnarrow gate, since the road that leads to perdition\r\nis wide and spacious and many take it. But it\r\nis a narrow gate and a hard road that leads to life\r\nand few there are who find it.\"\r\n\r\nReach their destination\r\nOnce we begin to take these words seriously, it\r\nappears that HIV may be a blessing. Some of\r\nthose travelling the wide and spacious road\r\nwould reach their destination except for the pain\r\nthey are forced to endure. This suffering has the\r\noverall effect of turning them around. It purifies\r\nthem spiritually. They change from being sheep\r\nwithout a shepherd, lost on roads leading to selfdestruction,\r\nand find themselves walking up that\r\nother road - the hard one, the one that leads to\r\nthe narrow gate.\r\nFind a cure for Aids, if possible. Teach everyone\r\nself-control, if possible. Some say we are succeeding.\r\nOthers say we still have a long way to\r\ngo. The good news is that God has his way of\r\nwriting straight with crooked lines, no matter\r\nwhat we do. Jesus is surely thinking of those who\r\nsuffer from Aids when he says: \"Come to me, all\r\nyou who labour and are overburdened and I will\r\ngive you rest.\"\r\n\r\nEffect of purifying\r\nHow can suffering do anybody any good? For\r\nthe same reason that Christ's death achieved salvation.\r\nWe will never understand it completely.\r\nBut we know that it works this way. St Paul\r\ninsisted that his own suffering was achieving this\r\nmysterious effect of purifying himself and others.\r\nAs he said in his epistle to the Colossians: \"It\r\nmakes me happy to suffer for you, as I am suffering\r\nnow, and in my own body to do what I can to\r\nmake up all that has still to be undergone by\r\nChrist for the sake of his body, the Church.\"\r\nAs Pope John Paul once said: \"Christ opened\r\nhimself from the beginning to every human suffering\r\nand constantly does so. Yes, it seems to be\r\npart of the very essence of Christ's redemptive\r\nsuffering that this suffering needs to be unceasingly\r\ncompleted.\"\r\nLike the Lamb of God dying on the cross, even\r\ninnocent children infected with HIV achieve\r\nimmeasurable benefit for someone else who\r\nneeds it. \"Suffering is something good,. before\r\nwhich the Church bows down in reverence with\r\nall the depth of her faith in the Redemption.\""}
