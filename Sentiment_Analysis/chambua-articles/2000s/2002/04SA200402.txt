CHURCH CALLS FOR OPENNESS ON HIV/AIDS

By NATION Correspondent
The Anglican has admitted that its long
silence on Aids has done a lot of
damage.
The Anglican Church archbishops
from the all over the world have called
for open debate about the scourge.
Speaking at Canterbury in the UK,
they joined calls by world leaders and
international organisations for cheaper
drugs and social acceptance of people '-.
living with HW.
The churCh affirmed its commitment
to join the fight against Aids in a joint
statement released by the Archbishop
of Canterbury last Saturday.
The archbishops said; "We raise our
voices to call for an end to silence about
this disease - the silence of stigma, the
silence of denial, the silence offear. We
confess that the Church herself has been
complacent. in this silence. When we
have raised our voices in the past, it has
been too often a voice of condemnation.
"We now wish to make it clear that
HIV/Aids is not a punishment from
God. Our Christian faitb compels us to
including thbse who are living with
HIV /Aids, are made in the image of
God and are children of God."
The leaders appealed to
pharmaceutical companil~s and agencies
to put life before profits by providing
cheaper drugs. The meeting, held once
every two years, is important in the
church's calendar.
