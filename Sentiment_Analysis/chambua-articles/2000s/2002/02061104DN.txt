{"text": "\ufeffDaily Nation / Tuesday, June 11,2002\r\nHEALTH\r\nRELIGIONS TOLD TO GET INVOLVED IN WAR ON AIDS\r\n\r\nBY JACINTA OCHIENG AND CLAY MUGANDA\r\nReligious organisations in Africa have\r\nbeen urged to join in the fight against\r\nAids.\r\nThe United Nations Special Adviser\r\non HIV/Aids in Africa, Mr Stephen\r\nLewis, challenged them to form a common\r\nplatform to spearhead the fight\r\nagainst the spread of the disease, saying\r\nthe war against the infection could not\r\nbe won without their active\r\nparticipation.\r\n\"You must come together in a great\r\nreligious partnership so that everyone is\r\ninvolved at every level. You should create\r\nthe structure to contain this disease,\"\r\nhe said\r\nAddressing\r\nparticipants in\r\nthe African\r\nReligious Leaders\r\nAssembly\r\non Children\r\nand HIV /Aids\r\nin Nairobi, Mr\r\nLewis added:\r\n\"There are 13 million children\r\norphaned by Aids in sub-Saharan Africa,\r\nwith the number almost certain to\r\ndouble by the end of the decade. It is\r\ntime religious leaders summoned their\r\nstrength to lead the continent out of\r\nthis misery.\"\r\nHe said religious leaders should insist\r\nthat the G-8 countries contribute to the\r\nGlobal Fund on Aids as they had\r\npledged.\r\n\"Early this month in Canada, the G-8\r\nleaders said they would not advance\r\nsignificant additional money to the\r\nFund. Religious leaders should remind\r\nthem of their pledge of 7 per cent of\r\ntheir GNP,\" he said.\r\nThe official said religious leaders\r\nwere the best placed to influence political\r\nleadership in the region because\r\nthey had contacts across the world.\r\nThe executive director of the United\r\nNations Children's Fund, Ms Carol Bellamy,\r\nsaid 800,000 children under the\r\nage of 15 years were infected each year\r\nand 14 million had been orphaned.\r\nShe was concerned that stigmatisation\r\nwas reversing the gains made in the\r\nfight against Aids.\r\nMs Bellamy said the role and contribution\r\nof religious organisations at the\r\nfamily and community levels was the\r\nkey to ensuring that Aids-affected children\r\nwere not subjected to stigma, discrimination\r\nand exclusion.\r\nIn a key-note address read by the\r\nPermanent Secretary for Health, Prof\r\nJulius Meme, Health Minister Maalim\r\nMohammed told the meeting that\r\nchurch leaders were better placed to\r\nfight the disease because of the large\r\nconstituency they were responsible for.\r\nThe four-day conference is expected\r\nto come up with a declaration to\r\naddress the needs of children in the face\r\nof HIV /Aids.\r\nThe meeting is organised by the\r\nWorld Conference on Religion and\r\nPeace and has brought together more\r\nthan 150 Roman Catholic, Ethiopian\r\nOrthodox, Protestant, Muslim and\r\nHindu leaders to share experiences in\r\nthe treatment and prevention of\r\nHIV /Aids\r\nThe group aims to promote interreligious\r\ncooperation to improve the\r\nefficiency of religious aid and outreach\r\nprogrammes for people with Aids.\r\nAt a press conference later, the religious\r\nleaders admitted that they had not\r\ndone enough to educate people on the\r\npandemic.\r\nHowever, they insisted that abstinence\r\nwas the most effective way of\r\npreventing HIV infection."}
