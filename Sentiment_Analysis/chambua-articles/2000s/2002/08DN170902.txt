 Aids control Bill welcome
        . when business resumes next month.
        he good news is that the draft HIV/Aids Prevention
 T        and Control Bill 2002 will be tabled in Parliament
    Better still, the proposed law takes the bull by the horns
 and bans the involu'ltary testing that has been perpetuated
 by insurance companies and employers. The draft Bill says
 categorically that no one should compel another to undergo
 the test as a precondition   for employment or as a basis for
 continued employment. Insurance firms are covered by the
 same provision.
    This is an important step towards helping Kenyans to come
 to terms with the exponential growth of HIV/Aids. For one,
 it seeks to dispel the stigma and discrimination    those living
 with Aids face ..                                           '
