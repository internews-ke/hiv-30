 In the recent past, Kenyans have witnessed economic decline never experienced before, ever since independence. At one time-in                      Lack of a clear energy policy means that there is no clear "road map" and use of energy sources in Kenya. It was submitted by the

 What has made Kenyans tired, and investors and donors cautious and careful about the Kenyan economy? A couple of factors that                             and cut costs of basic gas appliances
 are somewhat interrelated. First, it is hard to separate the overall wellbeing of a nation from the performance of its economy. People            Taxation and Tax Administration
