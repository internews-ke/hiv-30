She cheated on you and you can't\r\nswallow it! She rejected you for another who had more money to\r\nspend on her, because he has a job and you are unemployed.\r\nYou went out with her for three years, you became emotionally\r\ndependent on her and expected her to be with you in your grief\r\nand loneliness after your mother's death. Finally, in spite of all\r\nthe years' together you hadn't really got to know her or what she\r\nreally wanted from you. Now you know and the awareness is\r\npainful.\r\n   It was indeed normal for you to look for love and companion-\r\nship after your mother's death. The last thing you needed was to\r\nbe abandoned by your girlfriend. However cruel it may have\r\nseemed to be, your girlfriend was simply taking care of herself as\r\nshe had a right to do. She was not responsible for your grief nor\r\nwas she obliged to fill the gap left in your life by the death of\r\nyour mother.\r\nLosses threaten our se~festeem,\r\nand every time we suffer a blow\r\nto our self esteem, we suffer loss\r\n   Jack, you say you cannot forget her. Indeed, you will never\r\nforget her as long as you keep trying to replace her in your life\r\nwith women you consider more beautiful than she. On the con-\r\ntrary, you are keeping her memory alive by trying to take\r\nrevenge in this way. You get bored with these women because\r\nyou do not accept them for who they are, but simply as \"stop-\r\ngaps\" for the girl who abandoned you.\r\n   No wonder you cannot trust them, for you project onto them\r\nthe mistrust created in you when your former girlfriend deceived\r\nyou. Your thoughts are feeding your negative feelings and\r\nbehaviour. What a waste of time, energy and chances to create\r\nsome brand new and unique relationships!\r\n   There has been an accumulation of losses in your life lately. It\r\nis important for you to identify your losses and to grieve them.                                   Flying Dutchman Membership. Now open to all passengers over the age of 2.\r\nGrieving is a term that we usually use only in connection with\r\nthe death of a loved one. But we also need to grieve other losses,\r\nbecause they threaten our self-esteem, and every time we suffer\r\na blow to our self-esteem, we suffer loss. They are usually con-\r\nnected and interdependent.\r\n   One loss can make us fear further losses. Thus you abandon\r\nyour new girlfriends before they can abandon you as your\r\nformer girlfriend did.\r\n   The obvious losses you have suffered lately are your mother's\r\ndeath and your girlfriend's betrayal. Connected with these are\r\nloss of support in your time of grief, loss of control (helpless-\r\nness), loss of self-esteem, and possible loss of identity.\r\n   Then there is your unemployment, which probably aggravates\r\nsome, if not all, of the above.\r\n   So how do you deal with your losses? First it is important to\r\nidentify them. There may be some that you have not mentioned,\r\nor you are not immediately aware of. Secondly, identify and\r\nname all the feelings connected with them. Share your experi-\r\nences your thoughts and feelings with someone you trust - like\r\na friend, a pastor, a family member. Some face-to-face sessions\r\nwith a professional counsellor are also advisable.\r\n   You have taken the first step towards healing, Jack. Now fol-\r\nlow it up. Your happiness could depend on it.\r\n                                                                                                                             --l        FLYING\u00b7        \u2022    -    .,1.\\   \"    ,.,\r\n                                                                                                                                                       .~                    Kl.M            _\r\nAmani CounseUors can be reached thro,/!gh P.O.
