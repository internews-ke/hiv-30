                                               My: fellow Ke~v:ans.
               During my nomination           as the presidential    candidate on Monday 14th                   If there is one thing that holds us in bondage, as a nation, to shameful
               October, 2002 at Kasarani,         I made known my commitment              to institute          practices in managing our affairs, it is indiscipline.        We have to bring the
               programmes        to address Kenya's Economic Recovery. I promised to initiate                   ethos of integrity and discipline back to our lives. Everywhere,           the lapse in
:--r:--        measures to modernize and promote efficient management in agriculture,                           discipline has taken its toll: in the public service and in the private sector.
               health, education, tourism, infrastructure, security, trade and industry,
                                                                                                                This indiscipline      takes many forms, from the entrepreneur        who avoids
               including the small scale andJua           Kali enterprises.      I also promised to put in
                                                                                                                paying taxes, to the civil servant who neglects his work. Indeed, this erosion
               place measures to eradicate corruption           and to ensure that our environment
                                                                                                                in discipline and responsibility       is the root cause of the corruption     epidemic
               is conserved for the current and future generations.
                                                                                                                in our society today.
               This first presentation       lays out the summary        of my agenda for Kenya and
                                                                                                                Why is it that one's file cannot be found in a public registry? Why is it that
               also highlights     some of the major areas of immediate             concern.
                                                                                                                an unqualified      'well-connected'   student gets admitted to the best school
               As I have stated before, I am and I have always been a team player. No single                    while the qualified 'un-connected'        one stays at home? Why must a driver
               man or woman bears the answer to the problems and issues that face our                           overtake on the left and stop in the middle of the road? It is indiscipline,            my
               society. It will take all our abilities, working together, to see us through as                  fellow Kenyans, that robs us of the fruits of our hard work. This is what we
               we create a Kenyan nation that we, and generations                  to come, can all be          must resolve to eliminate:
               proud of.
                                                                                                                The conduct of government          and the people must be based on integrity.
               My fellow Kenyans, after nearly four decades of independence                     we can count    Government        must be responsive and willing to hear complaints          from the
               our blessings on a number          of fronts. We have remained:                                  people and make adequate redress. In this vein, the government               must make
               • at peace with ourselves and our neighbours;              and,                                  concerted efforts to inculcate a culture of discipline and must fight
               • enterprising      and resilient despite the very many hardships               we have had to   corruption    through      a system that nurtures   leaders who are accountable         to
                 go through.                                                                                    their constituents,       and whose focus is on social and economic priorities.

                                                                                                                Whilst I concede that we have unacceptable          levels of corruption     and that we

                                                                                                                must move towards zero tolerance to this vice, we also have to admit that the
               As 1 have stated in different fora, Kenya is faced with a number of critical                     structures    under which we have operated over the years may have
               challenges, including:                                                                           contributed      enormously     to the growth of this vice.
