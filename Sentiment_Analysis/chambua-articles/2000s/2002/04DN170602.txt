Fun for all as day of African child marked

BY DAVID MUGONYI
The Day of the African Child was
marked with pomp and colour in
Nairobi with a promise from the
government that it would fully
implement the Children's Act.
It was entertainment galore filled
with rib-cracking jokes, song, dance and
poems.
Huodreds of children gathered at the
Kenyatta International Conference
Centre and grounds to participate in
the day dedicated to the massacre of
700 of their colleagues in Soweto South
Africa years ago.
But despair was evident among many
as the themes of their presentation
revolved around child abuse, female
genital mutilation, child labour, forced
marriage and HIV /Aids pandemic.
Vice-President George Saitoti,
Unicef country representative Nicholas
Alipui, Lady Justice Joyce Aluoeh and
Home Affairs permanent secretary
Bernadette Musundi were present.
This year's theme was "A World Fit
for Children- Education for all
Children".
The children began the chilly day
early with a procession from Uhuru
Park under the guidance of the Starehe
Boys' Centre band. They later
assembled at the grounds to witness
shows organised by the Nation Media
Group.
Dr Alipui complained about the
growing number of street children who
had taken into glue sniffing.
"I am disturbed by the number of
children I see here holding glue ...we
have evidence that the substance is
detrimental to health as it damages the
lungs and brains."
Dr Alipui called on
non-governmental organisations dealing
with children and the gQvernment to
eradicate the behaviour.
He praised the government for
introducing legislation to acknowledge
children's rights.
The voting results for Kenya in the
"Say Yes for Children's campaign", Dr
Alipui said. recognised quality
education for all.
He said Unicef was not satisfied with
the gross enrolment rate at 88.1 per cent
for boys and 87.1 for girls.
"The national statistics hide large
regional and gender disparities and
there are over 1.7 million children,
mostly girls, who are denied education
opportunities," he observed.
The completion of primary schooling
for the girls, he added, was fundamental
to improving the status, empowerment
and productivity of women. It also has
significant effects on infant and child
survival, economic productivity,
reduction of fertility and quality of life.
Development partners, he said, were
striving to assist Kenya achieve
universal primary education and
education for all.
Prof Saitoti urged the continent to
reflect on children's suffering as a result
of ethnic or regional wars and those
serving in the army.
He said a solution must be found to
end the street children menace and
appealed to Kenyans to assist the
government resolve the problem.
"Don't be too self-centred, let us think
much more about our society."
The VP advised those who will
constitute the children's council-when
the Act is implemented - to ensure that
children have access to all basic needs.
The children took the opportunity to
present their grievances to Prof Saitoti.
The Chidren's Act came into force
on March 1.
