Patients with the disease pay about high cost of treatment. Sh2,370 per month. Meanwhile, the 56th annual general assembly of the National Council\r\nof Churches of Kenya (NCCK)\r\nresolved to encourage its members\r\nto develop policies that take into\r\n\r\nconsideration the needs of people\r\n\r\ninfected or affected by Aids.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe     umbrella     protestant\r\n\r\nchurches body also said at its\r\n\r\nrecent conference at the Kanamai\r\n\r\ncentre that the poverty levels\r\n\r\nafflicting    Kenyans     must be\r\n\r\naddressed as part of efforts to\r\n\r\nfight the disease.\r\n\r\nConservative estimates indicate\r\n\r\nthat more than 15 million people\r\n\r\nare living below the poverty line\r\n\r\nwhile more children continue to\r\n\r\ndrop out of school because of hun-\r\n\r\nger.\r\n\r\nSaid Rev Mutava Musyimi,\r\n\r\nNCCK secretary-general: \"Many\r\n\r\nof our people are desperate for\r\n\r\nrelief food. Many have no access\r\n\r\nto education, clean water, health\r\n\r\nfacilities and other basic necessi-\r\nties.\"\r\nIn his article appearing in \"The\r\n\r\nNCCK     Report     and       Strategic\r\n\r\nPlan\", Kilifi district medical\r\n\r\nofficer of health, Dr Samuel Were,\r\n\r\npleads with the church leaders to\r\n\r\n\"break their silence\" and forge a\r\n\r\n\r\nunited front in the fight against\r\n\r\nHIV/Aids.\r\n\r\nAccording to him the church\r\n\r\nshould target the high-risk groups\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch as truck drivers, commercial\r\n\r\nsex workers, intravenous drug\r\n\r\n\r\nusers and homeless youths with\r\n\r\npositive information on the dis-\r\n\r\n\r\nease.\r\n\r\nThr~ugh th,e use of voluntary\r\n\r\n\r\ncounselling and test sites estab-\r\n\r\n\r\nlished from a Sh50 million credit\r\n\r\n\r\ngiven by he World Bank in 1999,\r\n\r\n\r\nthe youths can get first-hand infor-\r\n\r\nmation from their peers who man-\r\n\r\n\r\nage the centres.\r\n\r\nThis, it is hoped, will increase\r\n\r\nfrom the current 10 per cent to 13\r\nper cent the number of Kenyans\r\nwho know their HIV ,status. This\r\nfigure is, however, not satisfactory\r\nto the government officers strug-\r\ngling to fight the scourge.\r\nThe last Budget set aside Sh300\r\nmillion to establish centres in Kis-\r\numu, Nakuru, Mombasa, Embu,\r\nKakamega, Garissa and Nyerialso\r\nnot only create awareness but to\r\n\r\ninstall facilities to be used in test-\r\n\r\n\r\ning and counselling.\r\n\r\nIn Kenya, combination therapy\r\n\r\ncosts around Sh7,000 a month\r\n\r\nwhich is beyond many people who\r\n\r\nwallow in poverty.\r\n\r\nThis is where the role of the\r\n\r\nchurch in the prevention of HIV\r\n\r\ninfection and care of the infected\r\n\r\nand affected comes in because of\r\n\r\nits influence on society.\r\n\r\nThe church has a powerful voice\r\n\r\nwith its own structures and sys-\r\n\r\ntems that can enable it to reach\r\n\r\nthe common man in a persuasive\r\n\r\nway.\r\n\r\nWith HIV/Aids affecting Chris-\r\n\r\ntians, Muslims and pagans alike,\r\n\r\nthe church cannot isolate itself in\r\n\r\nthe fight."}
