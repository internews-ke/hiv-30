More teachers needed
        created by deaths, retirements and resignations is
T      he Government's     decision to employ more teachers in
        the next two months to fill secondary school vacancies
 laudable.
     But the figure Education Minister Henry Kosgey named
 on Monday - 5,000 - falls far below the actual deficit.
 Combined with primary places, approximately         22,000 more
 teachers are needed.
    The ministry says it is constrained on the number to
employ. Like other Government          departments,  !t ar~ues, it is
under instruction not to enter any more hands mto Its
payroll.
    That is the reason it has opted merely to fill the vacancies,
not to create more places.      But there is a compelling
argument for a bigger teaching force.
    A growing population means increased school enrolment
and hence the need for more teachers. This is critical at this
point of increased teacher deaths from HIV /Aids.
    And, although education is a service "industry" and,          .
therefore, does not provide immediate monetary returns, Its
significance for socio-economic      growth is indisputable. To
investing more money in it, whenever possible, cannot be in
vain.
    If MPs, who are already overfed, can increase their own                                                                 NEW HOPE FOR FARMERS 0 JAINDI KISERO
salaries by big margins, it becomes even more compelling to
spend additional money to employ more teachers to support
millions of Kenyan children.
