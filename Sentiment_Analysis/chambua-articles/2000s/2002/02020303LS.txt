Many times I had been infected\r\nwith' sexually transmitted diseases.\"\r\nFortunately, Naisiadet had a good job as an\r\naccounting supervisor with an international bank in\r\nKenya, so she could support her children.\r\nBut her health started failing. \"My skin was, and\r\nstill is, my biggest problem. I had to spend a lot of\r\nmoney on medication. Alarmed at the medical\r\nbills, the bank investigated my case and discovered\r\nI was HIV-positive. They fired me. At that time\r\n(the 1980s and early 1990s), the stigma facing\r\nHIV/Aids was enormous, and I became an\r\noutcast.\"\r\n\r\nLife for the single mother was tough, and things\r\ngot worse when her father disowned her. \"He\r\nwanted nothing to do with me. He saw me as an\r\nembarrassment to him and a liability because of my\r\nhealth, family and economic woes.\"\r\nFriends too abandoned her. \"They did not want\r\nAbe associated with me. I was so alone, all by\r\n~self, when I most needed their support.\" Her\r\nself-esteem suffered a crashing blow. \"I felt dirty\r\nand contaminated. I was ashamed of what I had\r\nbecome and my self-confidence was very low.\r\nRumours were flying all over the place about my\r\ncondition. A few people attempted to talk to me\r\nabout it, but I was in serious denial and refused to\r\ndiscuss the matter. I began hiding from my friends.\r\nI was afraid to mix with people and shunned social\r\nengagements. \"\r\nShe desperately needed a job\r\nNaisiadet needed alternative options. \"I began\r\nmeeting HIV-infected people, and together we\r\nformed the Kenya Aids Society that was headed by\r\nJoe Muriuki. Later, I joined Wofak. I was getting\r\nemotional support from a social circle who identified\r\nwith and understood my situation.\"\r\nNaisiadet desperately needed a job, and got one\r\nas marketing director with an international yoghurtproducing\r\ncompany. But it was short-lived; soon\r\nthe employer found out she had the virus and fired\r\nher.\r\nIt was time for drastic measures to turn her life\r\naround. \"I decided to move to the US and change\r\n\u2022. life completely - for better medical care and to\r\n.oid the social stigma.\"\r\nTrouble brewing back home\r\nIn 1996, she moved to the US. However, she was to\r\ndiscover that HIV stigmatisation was not peculiar to\r\nKenya. \"I went to see a dentist, and in the patient's\r\nform I ticked HIV-positive. As soon as the dentist\r\nsaw that, she requested me to leave her clinic and\r\ncome back after three hours to give her time to sterilise\r\nthe room.\" Insulted, Naisiadet never went\r\nback.\r\nTrouble was brewing back home. \"My children,\r\nthen aged 10 and eight, were being told that I had\r\nabandoned them and gone to the US to die? I was\r\nso angry when I learned about it. I spoke to my children\r\nand reassured them that I was not going to die\r\nsoon and would be with them for a long time to\r\ncome.\"\r\nThe following year, 1997, she took her children\r\nwith her to the US.\r\n\"My t-cell count was very low and I was very\r\nsick. I told my children that I was HIV-positive, but\r\nnot before I had taken them for counselling. Now,\r\n~es 16 and 14, they are living happily with me.\r\n~ .. ~~ are in high school. They love and are proud of\r\n~ me. I have God to thank for that.\"\r\nHealthy eating and exercising\r\n\"It is very important for infected women to maintain\r\na social support network because this helps to\r\nboost their self-esteem. You know that you are\r\nloved and are not alone. Most importantly, the family\r\nshould support the patients.\"\r\nTo keep healthy and happy, Naisiadet takes good\r\ncare of herself. \"I took anti-retrovirals for two years\r\nand stopped because the side-effects were too much\r\nfor me; I constantly felt nauseated and tired. My\r\nremedy now includes healthy eating and exercising\r\na lot. I have love all around me from my children\r\nand husband who gave me a second chance, and\r\nfrom the friends I have today\".\r\nNaisiadet can testify that being HIV-positive is\r\nnot the end of the world. \"The most important thing\r\nis to lead a positive life, and you will live long.\""}
