AIDS ORPHANS IN BIRTH PAPERS PLEA

An Aids orphanage is appealing to the govern.
ment to help the children gel birth certificates.
The founder and administrator of Nairobi’s
Nyumbani Children’s Home. Fr Angelo
d’Agostino. said lack of the documents had
hampered the process of adopting them. “it’s
almost impossible lo have these children
acquire thc papers,” he said. “(It is)
 unfortunate the people who arc supposed to
help them are not doing so.”
A big number of the children were found
abandoned by the police and taken w the
home. That has made it difficult to establish
their background and the identity of their par
ents for purposes of acquiring birth certificates.
Fr d’Agosino said several children at the
home whose l-11V slatJs had changed urgently
required birth certificates.
