Why discriminate\r\nagainst those with HIV and not the ones with other sexually\r\ntransmitted diseases? Shall we also go ahead and isolate\r\nthose suffering from infectious diseases such as tuberculosis,\r\nleprosy, whooping cough or even the common flu?\r\n   To suggest that everyone with HIV must have their private\r\nhistory posted out on public notice boards, as it were, is to\r\nclaim a moral high ground that no one but God has the right\r\nto.\r\n    Whereas it is necessary for Kenyans to speak out publicly\r\nabout HIV/Aids, the battle will not be won by\r\nholier-than-thou       pronouncements.     The disease may have a\r\nknock-on effect in the lives of all Kenyans, but it is unlikely\r\nthat such proposals will stop people in their tracks and                                                                    GUNS OF AUGUST 0 MACHARIA GAITHO\r\nensure behavioral changes.\r\n    It is not as if the majority of Kenyans are not already\r\naware of the hows and whys of HIV /Aids.
