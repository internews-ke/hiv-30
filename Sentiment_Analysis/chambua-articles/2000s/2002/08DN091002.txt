of it considering how volatile the situation is due to the high
stakes involved.
    Reports of the riots that rocked Kakamega on Monday
should make us all pause and think. The scenes were not only
ugly, they could well herald worse things to come as the cru-
cial polls approach - unless drastic steps are taken to nip the
violence in the bud and apprehend those who may be inciting
it.
    However, before even considering countering force with
force, it must be realised that people don't just wake up one
morning, congregate in the streets, and spontaneously start
pelting police with stones. Something is seriously wrong in the
party that has ruled Kenya without interruption since inde-
pendence.

who ran amok chanted support for the National Alliance
