Harmonise medical training
"A        plan by the Government to develop a common
         curriculum for medical training is a move in the right
         direction. It will serve to stave off controversy that has
 been building over medical training in recent months, with
 the 'Health Min~stry taking issue with technical training
 institutions offering medical courses.
    In particular, questions have been raised abput the
 capacity of colleges like the Kenya Polytechnic to offer
 pharmacy and medical laboratory technicians' courses.
    The questions are: Do these colleges have the facilities,
 equipment and personnel to mount the courses? Where do
 they take their students for internship since they are not
 linked to medical facilities?
    But it is now emerging that a team"comprising Education
 and Health ministries has been working since last year to
 resolve these sticking issues and ensure that standards, ethics
 and professionalism are adhered to.
    Unlike other professions, medicine is about life and death.
 It has no room for guess work and experiments. Medical
 personnel must go through rigorous training to prepare them
 effectively to handle the delicate task\of saving lives.
    This is why we have reason to gel worried when questions
 are raised about the training programmes.

    Whatever the case, the bottomline is that medical training,                                                                                                                                      days has moved to fighting for insurance
