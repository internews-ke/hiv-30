Dear Jack,
Your feelings seem to range from anger and resentment to
shame and embarrassment. She cheated on you and you can't
swallow it! She rejected you for another who had more money to
spend on her, because he has a job and you are unemployed.
You went out with her for three years, you became emotionally
dependent on her and expected her to be with you in your grief
and loneliness after your mother's death. Finally, in spite of all
the years' together you hadn't really got to know her or what she
really wanted from you. Now you know and the awareness is
painful.
   It was indeed normal for you to look for love and companion-
ship after your mother's death. The last thing you needed was to
be abandoned by your girlfriend. However cruel it may have
seemed to be, your girlfriend was simply taking care of herself as
she had a right to do. She was not responsible for your grief nor
was she obliged to fill the gap left in your life by the death of
your mother.
Losses threaten our se~festeem,
and every time we suffer a blow
to our self esteem, we suffer loss
   Jack, you say you cannot forget her. Indeed, you will never
forget her as long as you keep trying to replace her in your life
with women you consider more beautiful than she. On the con-
trary, you are keeping her memory alive by trying to take
revenge in this way. You get bored with these women because
you do not accept them for who they are, but simply as "stop-
gaps" for the girl who abandoned you.
   No wonder you cannot trust them, for you project onto them
the mistrust created in you when your former girlfriend deceived
you. Your thoughts are feeding your negative feelings and
behaviour. What a waste of time, energy and chances to create
some brand new and unique relationships!
   There has been an accumulation of losses in your life lately. It
is important for you to identify your losses and to grieve them.                                   Flying Dutchman Membership. Now open to all passengers over the age of 2.
Grieving is a term that we usually use only in connection with
the death of a loved one. But we also need to grieve other losses,
because they threaten our self-esteem, and every time we suffer
a blow to our self-esteem, we suffer loss. They are usually con-
nected and interdependent.
   One loss can make us fear further losses. Thus you abandon
your new girlfriends before they can abandon you as your
former girlfriend did.
   The obvious losses you have suffered lately are your mother's
death and your girlfriend's betrayal. Connected with these are
loss of support in your time of grief, loss of control (helpless-
ness), loss of self-esteem, and possible loss of identity.
   Then there is your unemployment, which probably aggravates
some, if not all, of the above.
   So how do you deal with your losses? First it is important to
identify them. There may be some that you have not mentioned,
or you are not immediately aware of. Secondly, identify and
name all the feelings connected with them. Share your experi-
ences your thoughts and feelings with someone you trust - like
a friend, a pastor, a family member. Some face-to-face sessions
with a professional counsellor are also advisable.
   You have taken the first step towards healing, Jack. Now fol-
low it up. Your happiness could depend on it.
