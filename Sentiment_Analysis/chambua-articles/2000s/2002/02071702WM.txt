{"text": "\ufeffDaily Nation/ July 17, 2002\r\n\r\nWoman's second chance at life\r\nYou could not see her ears. Most of her body was covered\r\n\r\nCONTINUED FROM PAGE 1\r\n\r\nJosephine's illness, the village expert decreed,\r\nhad to be a result of her cooking with taboo fire-\r\nwood harvested from a tree struck by lightning. The\r\nrumble of thunder and the crack of lightning enjoys\r\ndeified reverence among the Marachi, as it does\r\namong almost all the communities living in western\r\nKenya.\r\nHerbal baths were prescribed and administered\r\n#NAME?\r\nHidden away\r\nAs her condition deteriorated, Josephine gradually\r\nlost appetite for food. Although her mother nursed\r\nher lovingly, she had to split her time between car-\r\ning for her and attending to other chores. She, too,\r\nbad given up on her daughter.\r\nWith time, their daughter became a secret, hid-\r\nden away in the hut the family used for a kitchen,\r\nthe door chained to its post, to keep the smell from\r\nher sores from fouling the air in the compound.\r\nCaring for their youngest child strained the rela-\r\ntionship between Odera and Imali no end.\r\nIt was Imali, though, who looked elsewhere for\r\nother solutions, considering that the herbs were\r\nnot helping much. \"A man who goes to the same\r\nchurch with us came and told us that the treatment\r\nwe were giving Josephine was not effective,\" she\r\nsays. Instead, their daughter was baptised and the\r\nrest left to Providence. In Butula, the church is a\r\nkpiritual place, but membership also ensures one a\r\ndecent and even colourful burial. A dignified\r\nending.\r\nThen a neighbour who has publicly declared that\r\nshe is HIV positive visited. Josephine's wounds\r\nwere an unspeakable sight. Poor hygiene and lack\r\nof proper treatment had given the warts time and\r\nopportunity to fester into deep sores that housed\r\nmaggots. She suggested that Josephine be taken to\r\nhospital, but with the sores on her body, transpor-\r\ntation would present a problem.\r\nMotorised transport is rare to the point of being\r\nnon-existent in Butula. So if someone falls ill, they\r\n\r\nare sat in a wooden cane chair, strapped onto a\r\nbicycle carrier and wheeled slowly and gently to\r\n\r\nthe hospital. It could take an hour, perhaps more,\r\ndepending on how sore the patient is.\r\n\r\nhe thought of taking Josephine to hospital\r\nthe hopelessness of his daughter's case. He\r\nT      frightened Odera no end. He thought about\r\nthought about the inevitable end, and then he\r\nthought about the expense of having to hire a vehi-\r\ncle to bring her body back. It was unbearable. It\r\nwas cheaper to wait and feed the mourners ...\r\nEven as Josephine's parents accepted what fate\r\nhad dealt them and their youngest daughter, neigh-\r\nbours who had seen the sores wrought on her body\r\nsuspected that it was a problem the local Aids\r\norganisation could help with. In Butula, it is not\r\nuncommon for people to disclose their positive\r\nHIV status, and those who succumb to Aids and\r\nAndrew Muli                 I Parenthood\r\nHelping children who suck their thumbs\r\n\r\nary Mukami had tried everything she\r\nM            knew to get her daughter to stop\r\nsucking her thumb.\r\n\"I punished her but that was not\r\n\r\nenough,\" says the mother of two. \"I then tied the\r\n\r\nhand she sucks to her bed. But I found out that\r\n\r\nshe woke up in the middle of the night and\r\n\r\nsucked the thumb.\"\r\n\r\nAnother parent, Wambua, rubbed pepper onto\r\n\r\nher son's thumb, hoping that this would deter him\r\n\r\nfrom putting it in his mouth. It did not work. The\r\n\r\nboy licked the pepper off, and then went ahead to\r\n\r\nsuck the thumb.\r\n\r\n\"I tried dressing the thumb with a band-aid,\r\n\r\nbut he removed it and continued to suck. He\r\ncontinued with the habit until he married,\" says\r\n\r\nWambua.\r\nThumb sucking is a common trait among chil-\r\ndren. The young of monkeys and chimpanzees\r\nsuck their thumbs, too, while elephant calves suck\r\ntheir trunks. Sucking of thumb, finger or trunk\r\nhas a soothing effect on the sucker. All children\r\nsuck their thumbs at one time or another in their\r\nlives, but most give up the habit as they grow. But\r\ndie are not eulogised with ambiguous illnesses.\r\nWhen Imali returned from her midwifery duties\r\n\r\non day, she found community workers from the\r\nRural Education and Empowerment Programmeat\r\n\r\nher home demanding that Josephine be released\r\nand taken to hospital at once. And so Josephine\r\nmade the seemingly impossible journey - on a\r\nbicycle carrier - and thus began a process of\r\n\"You could not see her ears. Most of her body\r\nhealing.\r\nwas covered in wounds and scabs,\" says Mary\r\nMakokha, the REEP coordinator. The nurses at the\r\nmission hospital washed Josephine's wounds in\r\nantiseptic and started her on antibiotic treatment.\r\nAs luck would have it, there was no funeral.\r\nAlthough there are still pock marks on Josephine's\r\nface and body, the wounds are all gone, except for\r\nthe ones on her knees. She was bed-ridden for a\r\nlong time, and so cannot move. But there is hope.\r\nMaybe in another month, she will go to the Busia\r\nDistrict Hospital for physiotherapy. Perhaps then,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere are some people, like Wambua's son, who\r\nsuck their thumbs all the way into adulthood.\r\nIt is common for parents to try to stop thumb-\r\nsucking by insisting that the child discontinue the\r\n\r\nhabit, often under threat of some form of punish-\r\n\r\nment. If such an ultimatum is given without an\r\nalternative, though, the child is unlikely to give it\r\n\r\nup. Parents need to give concrete reasons for\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir disapproval of the habit. When a child sucks\r\n\r\nhis thumb, for instance, his hands are often dirty,\r\n\r\nwhich could result in his contracting diseases like\r\n\r\ntyphoid, diarrheoa, tuberculosis, pneumonia or\r\n\r\nworms. It should be remembered, though, that\r\n\r\nthe urge to suck the thumb is so great that\r\nhygiene is irrelevant to the child.\r\n\r\n\r\nDelicate skin\r\nApart from diseases, the texture of the sucked\r\nfinger or thumb is weakened to some extent. Just\r\nbelow the nail of the thumb or finger, is the invis-\r\nible part of the nail. Though quite strong, it can\r\nbe ruined by sucking.\r\nChildren spend an incredible amount of time\r\npreoccupied with thumb sucking. The child is\r\nshe will be able to move again.\r\n\"I want to walk again,\" says Josephine, her voice\r\n\r\nstrong and emotional. There is little fear of death in\r\nher thoughts. Her parents no longer look at her as a\r\n\r\ndying person. They have been counselled on giving\r\ncare to their daughter from home.\r\n\"Now, she is okay. She will walk again,\" her\r\nfather says hopefully.\r\nNegative result\r\n\r\nFor her part, Imali has learnt a thing or two about\r\nHIV. First, she took an HIV test because she had\r\nbeen caring for her daughter and feared thai she\r\nmight have been infected. So far, she has a negative\r\nresult and will take another test in three months.\r\n\"I had to take the test to be certain that I was\r\nokay. I wanted to be sure that caring for my daugh-\r\nter was not putting the women I attend to in danger\r\nof infection.\"\r\n\"Since Josephine was tested, we have accepted\r\nher condition and are ready to care for her,\" says\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlikely to be absent-minded and idle, even skip-\r\nping duties in order to suck the thumb.\r\nThumb sucking can lead to feelings of guilt and\r\n\r\nlow self-esteem arising from negative comments\r\nmade by people. Children will go as far as isolat-\r\n\r\ning themselves from others for fear of being made\r\n\r\nfun of. A teenager will suck his thumb in secret to\r\n\r\navoid being seen and ridiculed.\r\n\r\nAn informal study carried out over a period of\r\n\r\n30 years on a subject, Dan, yielded a number of\r\n\r\ninteresting results.\r\n\r\nDan was found to have a 'heavy tongue' - he\r\n\r\nhad difficulty pronouncing the sounds's' and 'z'.\r\n\r\nFor\r\ninstance, he would read 'Salsa' as 'Thaltha' and\r\n\r\n'zero' as 'thero'. It appeared that the constant\r\nmovement and folding of the tongue as he sucked\r\nhis thumb affected his pronunciation. When Dan\r\neventually stopped sucking his thumb, his pro-\r\nnounciation improved.\r\nWhile thumb-sucking can be a long-term prob-\r\nlem, it is always possible to stop it in childhood.\r\nFrom Dan's experience the following suggestions\r\nwere made for handling this problem:\r\nImali. \"Even if you do not have symptoms, it is\r\n\r\nimportant to go for testing. You never know,\" a\r\n\r\nwizened Imali as she cares for her daughter, Imali\r\nEyery day, says.\r\n\r\nthinks about how her family has triumphed over\r\nAids, even if temporarily. Aids, when it touches the\r\nfamily, is not some terrifying thing to flee from.\r\nhas no cure, they are confident that their daughter      II\r\nEven though Josephine's parents know that Aids\r\nwill live for a long time, given the correct care. The\r\nfruit hanging from the avocado trees and the man-\r\ngoes ripening in the branches are harvested and a\r\nshare kept for their ailing daughter. A special diet \u2022\r\nof fish and a daily dose of compassion have brought\r\nthe Oderas closer to each other than they have\r\nbeen in a long time.\r\nAnd whenever Makokha visits to check on Jose-\r\nphine, she is treated like a very important visitor:\r\n\"You raised my daughter from the dead,\" says\r\nOdera.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022 Parents should not make a fuss about finger-\r\n\r\n\r\nDon't fuss\r\n\r\n\r\nsucking by infants as this is normal behaviour at\r\n\r\nthat age. The habit can be discouraged aftewards.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Do not punish the child or inflict pain on the\r\n\r\nthumb to discourage the habit. Instead, create\r\n\r\ndiscipline by explaining why you dislike the habit.\r\n\r\nA child will only agree to listen and change if he\r\n\r\nis convinced about why he should.\r\n\r\n\u2022 The child should be given some responsibili-\r\n\r\nties around the home to prevent idleness. Tasks\r\n\r\ngiven to the child should involve use of the hands ..\r\nConsider activities like keeping rabbits or chick-\r\nens.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Give a token whenever the child does not suck\r\nhis thumb.\r\n\u2022 As much as possible, avoid leaving the child\r\non his own.\r\n\u2022 Children ought to be told that they can get ill,\r\nand what diseases they can get, if they do not quit\r\nthe habit.\r\n\r\nammutisoke@yahoo.com"}
