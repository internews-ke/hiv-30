                 Kanu summit reassuring
                         This was reassuring, taking place after a whole month
                         anu yesterday emerged from a national summit of
                      K  officials apparently intact and even united in purpose.
                  of high-level acrimony that, at times, seemed as if it would
                  tear the ruling party asunder.
                     The question of who would be Kanu's presidential
                  candidate when Mr Moi retires and how the party would ,
                  nominate him or her proved more contentious and divisive
                  than the players might originally have imagined. The
                  President merely raised the tempers by seeming to impose
                  his own preference on his colleagues.
                    He did a good thing, therefore, to call this meeting of the
                  par~y's National Executive Committee (NEe) to thrash out
                  this issue and try to bring down the tempers of factionalism.
                  For the dangers went beyond the' party's confines, giving ,;
                  every conscious Kenyan a cause to worry.                                                                                                       ))
                     If the party had disintegrated in recriminatory ,
                  circumstances, it would have hurled perilous political debris
                  far and wide, leaving destruction in its wake. It is to be
                  commended that members yesterday spoke so openly.
                     For a party shows that it is maturing when it opens up its
                  interstices so that internal differences can be debated
                  unhindered and the differences continually resolved by
                 -means of free and regular voting.
                     Protracted absence of this intra-party freedom is what has
                  allowed intense anger to accumulate within ..                                                                                                                                                         ,

                  with the promise that the debate would now be free.
                     Conference sources reported that he had listened to the
                  accusations and counter-accusations without seeming to take
                  any sides ..And no ugly altercations were reported. This was                                                                                 my
