{"text": "\ufeffDaily Nation! Thursday, April 25, 2002\r\n\r\nFORUM FOR PRESENTATION OF NEW FINDINGS\r\n\r\nOver the years, the Kenya Medical Association\r\n(KMA) has continued to\r\nadvance the aspirations of the medical\r\nfraternity. This includes the quest for\r\nprofessional knowledge and improved standards\r\nof medical care. Towards this end, the world\r\nrenowned East African Medical Journal has been\r\npublished regularly with contributions and readership\r\ncovering most of Africa. Medicus, a more\r\nfree reading publication, is also being revived.\r\nKMA has always recognised the need for\r\ndecent housing for its members hence the initiation\r\nof affordable housing schemes. The first such\r\nscheme was built in South C, Nairobi. Two more\r\nprojects in Lang'ata area are underway. It is\r\nhoped that these initiatives shall be expanded to\r\nother towns throughout the country.\r\nThe annual scientific conference provides a\r\nforum for presentation of new findings and\r\nexchange of views within the medical profession\r\nboth in Kenya and the world at large.\r\nKMA finds itself at a crucial time in the history\r\nof this country, when it must playa pivotal role in\r\na changing political, economic and social environment.\r\nConcern over poor health services especially in\r\nthe public sector, occasioned by demoralised doctors,\r\nhas led to KMA lobbying strongly for the\r\nimprovement of terms and conditions of service\r\nof doctors. This culminated in the recent increase\r\nin the allowances payable to doctors in the civil\r\nservice.\r\nIt is hoped that this is but a beginning and that\r\ndiscussions will continue on ways of improving\r\nthe working environment of doctors and other\r\nhealth workers in order to stem their exodus to\r\nforeign countries.\r\nHIV/Aids remains a major health problem in\r\nKenya and sub Saharan Africa as a whole. Prevention\r\nof mother-to-child transmission of HIV\r\nvirus requires specific mention given the potential\r\nfor preventive drugs in this area.\r\nHealthcare financing is another vexing anomaly.\r\nHuman rights form an integral part of the medical\r\nprofession and KMA views with concern the\r\nbreach of rights of all groups within society, particularly\r\nrights of inmates and those' in police custody.\r\n'\r\nA programme to educate medical practitioners\r\nand the disciplined forces on these rights is underway.\r\nThe reproductive and sexual\u00b7healthrights of\r\nwomen have gone unrecognised for a long time.\r\nThis has led to deaths due to unsafe abortion, sexual\r\nviolence and other forms of aggression on the\r\ngender. This is a matter that will require enlightenment\r\nof the medical profession and the public\r\nin order to come lll?:.~ that safeguards\r\nthe rights of all. ,.;;<7:\"~\u00b7'\r\nKenya Medical A_iation is not withdrawn\r\nfrom the constitutional making process. We\r\nbelieve that many of the issues mentioned can be\r\naddressed through provisions within a wellformulated\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nDR. JAMES NYIKAL, KMA CHAIRMAN\r\n\r\nLEADING CAUSE OF DEATHS IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA\r\nKenya Medical Association, E,I,doret division, wishes.\r\nto welcome all participants tQ tbe 30th Kenya MedIcal\r\nAssociation Scientific Conference and Annual\r\nGeneral Meeting. \"\r\nThe conference has attained real regional status. In attendance\r\nare, delegates from Uganda and Tanzania and this is in\r\nthe spirit of the East African Community. I would like to\r\nacknowledge the presence of the representatives of Uganda\r\nMedical Association, Tanzanian Medical Association as well as\r\nmembers of the medical boards from the three East African\r\ncountries. I also welcome all my medical colleagues and other\r\nprofessionals who are present attending the meeting.\r\nThe conference began with a pre-conference football match\r\nbetween Kenya and Uganda. The scientific sessions start today.\r\nAs the theme of the conference states, \"HIV/Aids: The emerging\r\nchallenges of total quality health care in Kenya\": the meeting\r\nhas come at the right time in the evolving scenano of HIV I\r\nAids.\r\nTwenty years after the first clinical evidence of ~ids ~as\r\nreported, HIV/Aids has become the most devastatIng ~Isease\r\nhumankind has ever faced, with 60 million people havmg been\r\ninfected to date. An estimated 28.1 million people now live\r\nwith the virus in sub-Saharan Africa, while 2.3 million Africans\r\ndied from Aids in the year 2001. ..\r\nThis makes HIV/Aids the leading cause of mortality In sub-\r\nSaharan Africa.\r\nThe papers being presented will address the global burden of\r\nthe infection situation of HIV/Aids both in Kenya and Uganda,\r\nmanage~ent of HIV/Aids in general, but more spe~ifically\r\nfocusing on the use of anti-retrovirals, and the preventIOn of\r\nmother-to-child transmission.\r\nApart from HIV /Aids, malaria is another major cause of\r\nmortality and morbidity not only in Kenya, bu.t in the sub-\r\nSaharan, region and other parts of the developIng world.\r\nTuberculosis is on the rise, and there is a noticeable increase\r\nin prevalence of the chro~non-infectious conditions. These\r\nareas are also being addressed by the conference.\r\nThe issues of quality of health care in general calls for scru- ~\r\ntiny of our health care delivery system. Healthc~re financin~\r\nand how it relates to the quahty of health care Willalso be diScussed.\r\nThis will later culminate in the political parties symposia on\r\nhealth and policy that we hope will be attended by representatives\r\nof all major political parties in the country.\r\nI would also like to thank all the people who have worked ~\r\ntirelessly to make this conference a success and in particular\r\nthe organising committee and scientific commit.teeip' Eldoret ~\r\nnational executive council led by Dr. JamesNYlkat, Apex Co\r\nmunications and our sponsors .\u2022 -- ~\r\nI also invite all of you to attend our dinner dance on Satue\r\nday April 27, 2002. ~\r\n\u2022Dr~S~~~~?NtlegeK,MA Eldoret division cltairman"}
