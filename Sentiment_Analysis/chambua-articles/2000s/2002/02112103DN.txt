Six other countries\r\nthat have done well on adult literacy are\r\nEquitorial Guinea, Congo, South Africa,\r\nZimbabwe and Namibia.\r\nDespite Kenya's achievements, the\r\nreport shows that many children still\r\ndrop out of school, joining the ranks of\r\nilliterate youth.\r\nOn average, about 40 per cent of\r\nthose enrolled in Standard One do not\r\ncomplete the primary school cycle.\r\nPublished annually by Unesco, the\r\nreport says that unless checked, the\r\nHIV/Aids pandemic is likely to reverse\r\nthe gains made in educiltion.\r\nIt says about 15 per cent of Kenyans\r\nin the age bracket 15-49 are infected\r\nwith HIV.
