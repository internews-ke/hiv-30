By JACINTA OCHIENG and CAROL NYAKUNDI
Africa is doomed without good
governance and sound economic and
education policies. international
Monetary Fund Country Represenlative
Samuel Itam said yesterday.
“These policies are bound to be
rewarded with greater access to
international markets, higher
investment inflows, stronger economic
growth and more jobs.”
Addressing guests at the 24th
graduation
ceremony of the
United States
International
University (USIU) in
Nairobi, Mr. Itam said
education must
be given top priority in the war against
poverty.
“An economy cannot develop its
natural resources effectively without
developing its human capital through
education. It is. therefore, important
that the mix of education output accords
well with the economy’s prevailing and
prospective production structures,” he
said.
The HIV-Aids pandemic. •poor
governance, resource mismanagement
arid globalisation were the challenges
facing Africa in the 21st Century.
“These are daunting challenges and
unless we face them squarely and
resolutely, Africa will continue to lag
behind the rest of the world in terms of
economic development.
“We in Africa know we cannot beat
globalisation, therefore, we should, and
will, join the process wholeheartedly.
This will be a difficult task but one
which can be accomplished, provided
policymakers in Africa and the
international community are ready to
play their respective parts.”
He said globalisation had brought
considerable economic benefits, in
general, but marginalised countries
without proper development policies.
Mr ham asked African leaders to
take advantage of the New Partnership
for Africa’s Development (Nepad), an
initiative aimed at reducing poverty in
the region. Developed countries should
open up their markets to African
countries without conditions, he added.
‘Integration into the global economy
must be allowed by the developed
countries by permitting greater global
specialisalion.
“Lconomic and social development
in Africa is hindered by a high degree
of economic and political uncertainty,
structural rigidities, high transaction
costs, cumbersome administrative
procedures and weak governance.” he
said,
Mr 11am appealed to the developed
world to allow benefits to spread to
Africa through partnership rather than
patronage.
To African governments. Mr Itam
asked for sound macroeconomics
policies, good governance, improved
expenditure management, efficient
legal and financial institutions and
price liberalisation.
The USIU Chancellor, Dr Freida
Brown, said the institution had 2,500
students. 53 per cent of them female.
The university’s retention rate was
over 80 per cent. “This percentage
ranks us with the highly selective
universities like Harvard and
Stanford.”
Dr Brown added: “Our applicants
for the upcoming Fall quarter have
doubled and we have had to move
toward meritorious admission for some
programmes.”
