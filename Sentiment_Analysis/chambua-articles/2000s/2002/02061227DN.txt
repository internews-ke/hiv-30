At one time-in                      Lack of a clear energy policy means that there is no clear \"road map\" and use of energy sources in Kenya. It was submitted by the\r\n 1979-the economy grew by about 8 per cent, exceeding growth of powerhouses like the United States and the East Asian tigers of                     Petroleum Institute of East Africa that the sector is an important \"driver\" of economic growth. However, the sector needed support to:\r\n today. This remarkable performance has instead been replaced with dismal performance whose pinnacle was the year 2000 when the                             Set up sub-sector dialogue with parliament to facilitate easy resolution of energy sector specific problems\r\n economy contracted by 0.3 per cent, the first negative growth since 1963. The forecast as contained in the just released Economic                          Provide capital allowances for new sub sector entrants\r\n Survey 2002 does not paint a rosy picture.

A couple of factors that                             and cut costs of basic gas appliances\r\n are somewhat interrelated. First, it is hard to separate the overall wellbeing of a nation from the performance of its economy. People            Taxation and Tax Administration\r\n are becoming increasingly attentive to the nation's not so impressive economic growth. It is understandable why the corporate sector,              Submissions were received from Institute of Chartered Public Accountants of Kenya (ICPAK)\r\n MPs, Civil Society Organizations and even foreign investors are making noise as to why something credible in terms of economic                     Income Tax\r\n policy is not forthcoming, and angry that the economic downtum is taking their funds and livelihoods down too.                                            Exclude capital distributions by companies from compensating tax computation\r\n                                                                                                                                                           Rational tax treatment of aircraft in light of international proactive and waive 15\"10\r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                withholding tax on aircraft fuel\r\n Secondly, experience has shown that there is strong correlation between economic performance and employment levels, social order,                          Introduce a \"small company\" tax rate\r\n govemance and corruption. So when economic desperation reached critical level, too many jobless Kenyans started looking for                               Make the cost of staff meals tax deductible\r\n alternatives.

But                         Increase relief to Kshs 18,000 per month and expand tax bands to K\u00a3 9,000\r\n agricultural conditions, and its markets too, are changing rapidly. Technological advances are substituting natural products with                         Encourage house ownership by increasing ceiling on interest on owner-occupied houses from Kshs 100,000 to Kshs\r\n synthetic ones thus diminishing markets for primary products, inputs are now costly, and small-scale farmers are un-prepared for                          400,000\r\n adverse weather. Also, the infrastructure and policy environment is making the sector (and many others in Kenya) simply                                   Revise penalty rates on late tax payment from 20\"10 15\"10to      VAT\r\n un-competitive. All this has I.edto the aching of the \"backbone\" that has all along been expected to hold the economy together.                           Reduce VAT rate\r\n                                                                                                                                                           Eliminate 6 months time limit for claim of input VAT or set it at 5 years\r\n The most ironical thing is that any little growth that we have witnessed over the last couple of years has been attributed to                             Exempt retirement benefit schemes from VAT\r\n improvements in agricultural output; and that increase in output, to improved rainfall. So, for how long should we put up with the                        Reinstate basic foodstuffs as zero rated and not exempt supplies\r\n uncertainty of a rain-fed agriculture?
