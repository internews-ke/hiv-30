 No sex please, we're teenagers
 Miss America's message lands on a fertile ground, virgins rise in number
              By LIFESTYLE Writer
                 ack in the 1960s the world was
 B                awash with the slogan "No sex
                  please, we are English". It poked
                 fun at the English          over their
                 perceived       disinterest       and
                 conservative attitudes towards sex.
   Those were the days of sex liberation, streaking
 and nudity were fads and miniskirts were in vogue
 but the imperial English were seen to be stiff and
 boring.

 pandemic, as defined by two events this year. What
 was a bad joke on the English is gaining vogue
 among moral and HIV crusaders who now consider
 abstinence the ultimate protection qgainst affliction
 and moral decadence.

imposed the umchwasho, a traditional chastity rite
that ensures girls remain virgins until they are IH.
