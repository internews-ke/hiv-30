One must\r\n wonder then, does right and wrong change with each generation\r\n and culture?\r\n    Secondly, while the act may be the same, it is generally agreed\r\n that one's motive will determine whether their behaviour is good\r\n or evil. The biblical commandment - Thou Shalt Not Kill - is\r\n one such example, especially in instances of mercy killing or\r\n euthanasia. While each of us may have strong views on the sub-\r\n ject, we accept that these may not be as clear-cut when we, our-\r\n selves, or a loved one are suffering under a debilitating disease.\r\n    However, actions which are motivated by good causes are gen-\r\n erally pardoned even when they result in misfortune. In such\r\n instances, we come face to face with the uncomfortable question;\r\n which is the greater good and which, the lesser evil?\r\n    Third, who are the custodians of our morals? Is it the reigning\r\n 'civilisation' and empires of our day? Especially when these same\r\n 'empires' find themselves groping in the dark and are probably\r\n more immoral than we are? In some European countries it is\r\n unlawful for adults to have sexual relations with minors yet quite\r\n lawful for the same adult to log on to an adult site on the Internet\r\n that uses children or child like figures in sexual acts. Talk about\r\n double standards and these are the educated civilisations we are\r\n supposed to be taking our cues from.\r\n    Martin Luther King Jr. warned that the \"The most dangerous\r\n criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals.\"\r\n He also added, \"We must remember that intelligence is not\r\n enough. Intelligence plus character '- that is the goal of true edu-\r\n cation ... If we are not careful, our colleges will produce a grO\\lp\r\n of close-minded, unscientific, illogical propagandists, consumed\r\n with immoral acts.\"                     .\r\n True north never changes\r\n Finally, is there such a thing as absolute good or right? I like the\r\n definition of Stephen Covey, who writes in The Seven Habits of\r\n Highly Effective Families that there is such a thing as 'true north'\r\n in determining moral values.\r\n    He writes that true north, \"never changes. It represents a natu-\r\n ral magnetic force on the earth. I have used this demonstration in\r\n places throughout the world - including on ships at sea and even\r\n on satellite broadcasts with hundreds of thousands of people par-\r\n ticipating in different locations around the globe. It is one of the\r\n most powerful ways I have ever found to communicate that there\r\n is such a thing as magnetic north. I use this i.llustration to make the\r\n first point: Just as there is a 'true north' - a constant reality out-\r\n side ourselves that never changes - so there are natural law or\r\n principles that never change. And these principles ultimately gov-\r\n ern all behaviour and consequences.\"\r\n    As Covey asserts, when most of us encounter the big universal\r\n questions, we generally have a common understanding of what is\r\n right and what is wrong. We try to locate true north. It is right for\r\n a mot~er to nurture her child. It is wrong for a man to take an\r\n innocent life. It is right for a teacher to correct a student. It is\r\n wrong fora person to take another's property by force. It is right\r\n to care for the less fortunate. It is wrong to victimise the weak, and\r\n so on.\r\n    It is usually the gray areas, those instances where what is right\r\n and wrong seems to be two sides of the same coin that we rarely\r\n know what to do? Who can conclusively say what the good cause\r\n of action is then? While it may have become more difficult to\r\n determine,   we should consider our motives, the means of achiev-\r\n  ing our aims and the consequences of our actions. So help us God.\r\n  cmandi@yahoo.com\r\nPage \f\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------Trial Version-----------------------\r\n\r\nConvert PDF to Text Desktop Software.\r\n\r\nCopyright Convertpdftotext.net 2014.\r\n\r\nTo remove these lines, please activate your software from http://www.convertpdftotext.net/buynow.htm\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------"}
