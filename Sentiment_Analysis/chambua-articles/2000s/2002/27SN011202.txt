 Given that over 28 million people                                                             NACC's Multi-Sectoral

 pandemic are being utili sed in
 prevention and advocacy. This is
 done through:
  • Increasing awareness and pos-
 itive behaviour change among
  priority groups in Kenya.
  • Prevention of Mother-to-

  • Increasing accessibility to V01-
  untary Counselling and Testing
  (VCT) services.
   NACC continues to support
  communities, NGOs and other
  stakeholders to create awareness
  on the HIV/Aids epidemic. This
  awareness is expected to trans-
  late to behaviour change. In this
  regard, behaviour change com-
   munication campaign activities
   such as the promotion of safe
   behaviour, condoms and VCT
   on print and electronic media
   have been stepped up.
