It will serve to stave off controversy that has\r\n been building over medical training in recent months, with\r\n the 'Health Min~stry taking issue with technical training\r\n institutions offering medical courses.\r\n    In particular, questions have been raised abput the\r\n capacity of colleges like the Kenya Polytechnic to offer\r\n pharmacy and medical laboratory technicians' courses.\r\n    The questions are: Do these colleges have the facilities,\r\n equipment and personnel to mount the courses?
