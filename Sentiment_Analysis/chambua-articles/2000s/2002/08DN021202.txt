     During the United Nations World Aids Day marked
  ·esterday, it was learnt that only 10 per cent of Kenyans are
  fIV positive, translating into 2.2 million, while 1.5 million
  lave already died. These are not small figures by any
  eckoning, and although the Government attributes the
  ninuscule decline to an "aggressive anti-Aids campaign
  mdertaken by the Government and non-governmental

  vith a grain of salt are reports from the provinces. One

  hose who go for HIV tests - voluntary or not - are testing
  lositive. And yet Nyeri District is not the most heavily hit by
  his epidemic. Districts like Thika, and many areas of Nyanza
