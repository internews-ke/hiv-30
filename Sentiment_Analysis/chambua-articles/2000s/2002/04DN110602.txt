HEALTH
RELIGIONS TOLD TO GET INVOLVED IN WAR ON AIDS

BY JACINTA OCHIENG AND CLAY MUGANDA
Religious organisations in Africa have
been urged to join in the fight against
Aids.
The United Nations Special Adviser
on HIV/Aids in Africa, Mr Stephen
Lewis, challenged them to form a common
platform to spearhead the fight
against the spread of the disease, saying
the war against the infection could not
be won without their active
participation.
"You must come together in a great
religious partnership so that everyone is
involved at every level. You should create
the structure to contain this disease,"
he said
Addressing
participants in
the African
Religious Leaders
Assembly
on Children
and HIV /Aids
in Nairobi, Mr
Lewis added:
"There are 13 million children
orphaned by Aids in sub-Saharan Africa,
with the number almost certain to
double by the end of the decade. It is
time religious leaders summoned their
strength to lead the continent out of
this misery."
He said religious leaders should insist
that the G-8 countries contribute to the
Global Fund on Aids as they had
pledged.
"Early this month in Canada, the G-8
leaders said they would not advance
significant additional money to the
Fund. Religious leaders should remind
them of their pledge of 7 per cent of
their GNP," he said.
The official said religious leaders
were the best placed to influence political
leadership in the region because
they had contacts across the world.
The executive director of the United
Nations Children's Fund, Ms Carol Bellamy,
said 800,000 children under the
age of 15 years were infected each year
and 14 million had been orphaned.
She was concerned that stigmatisation
was reversing the gains made in the
fight against Aids.
Ms Bellamy said the role and contribution
of religious organisations at the
family and community levels was the
key to ensuring that Aids-affected children
were not subjected to stigma, discrimination
and exclusion.
In a key-note address read by the
Permanent Secretary for Health, Prof
Julius Meme, Health Minister Maalim
Mohammed told the meeting that
church leaders were better placed to
fight the disease because of the large
constituency they were responsible for.
The four-day conference is expected
to come up with a declaration to
address the needs of children in the face
of HIV /Aids.
The meeting is organised by the
World Conference on Religion and
Peace and has brought together more
than 150 Roman Catholic, Ethiopian
Orthodox, Protestant, Muslim and
Hindu leaders to share experiences in
the treatment and prevention of
HIV /Aids
The group aims to promote interreligious
cooperation to improve the
efficiency of religious aid and outreach
programmes for people with Aids.
At a press conference later, the religious
leaders admitted that they had not
done enough to educate people on the
pandemic.
However, they insisted that abstinence
was the most effective way of
preventing HIV infection.
