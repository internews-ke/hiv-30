 P           fuelling HIV/AIDS prevalence in Africa.
             The scourge is more devastasting Africa
  in deep poverty than the developed countries.
     In Kenya, like in most of Africa, poverty
 remains one ofthe greatest challenges cutting
 across all the socio-economicand cultural dimen-
 sions of the society. According to the Welfare
 Monitoring Report of 1996, 52 per cent the Ken-
 yan population was considered as still living
 below the minimum poverty line.
     The situation may be worse than the the report
 predicted. The economic performance has contin-
 ued to decline.
     "Kenya is also one of the countries in the region
 where poverty is most pervasive and economic
 growth one of the weakest." observes Elly Oduol,
 senior programme officer, United Nations Devel-
 opment Programme, UNDP Nairobi Office.
      It is because this poverty that the HIV/AIDS
 situation in Kenya and Africa in general has
 become catastrophic.
     According to an UNAlDS report of 1998, 90
 per cent of the 33.4 million people with HIV glo-
 bally live in sub-Saharan Africa.
     As the world marked the International Day for
 the Eradication of Poverty on Tuesday, this week,
 it became more evident that to effectively fight
  HIV/AIDS, the fight must start with poverty alle-
 viation or eradication of absolute poverty. "AIDS
 should be seen more as a development issue than
 just a health issue." advises Oduol.
     The hard economic times, that are further fuel-
  ling poverty levels in Kenya, are in effect fuelling                                    A Students' march with a ballne,. that speaks vOlumes on bow to keep the Killer disease at bay.
