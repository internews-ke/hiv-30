        T         for inauguration in Kisumu
                  today is lrightly located on one
    ,             of the ,poorest regions of the
I.-,    country.
___         Sited near Kiboswa, on the Ramogi
        Hills overlooking Kisumu iown, the
        Poverty Studies Centre seeks to enhance
        capabilities of individuals within the
        civil society so as to enable them
        promote social and economic
        development particularly of the poor and
        vulnerable. This it seeks to do using a
        three-pronged approach of training,
        research studies and policy analysis.
            Previously known as the Development
        Training Centre, the PSC will work to
        promote social justice and equity so as to
        ensure training activities are grounded in
        experience and address contemporary
        concerns in poverty and policy.
            Since its establishment in 1989, over
         100 organisations, among them a large
        number of grass roots institutions have
        utilized resources at the center to hone
        their activities geared at promoting
        people-centred development.
            These are diverse, including
        governance, gender equity, sustainable
        livelihoods, the Aids pandemic and
        advocacy.
            Amongst its existing facilities are four
        fully equipped training halls,
        study/reflecti'on areas, a spacious
        library/resource center, computer room,
        hostels with a capacity of 60 people and
        a dining room. For the regional and                                                                                                                                           their knowledge of issues, capacity
