   Medics have critic/sed Traditional Birth
   Attendants (TBAs) as ineffective in
   reducing deaths among women they
   attend to and should be de-emphasised.
        "For three decades, we spent time
   investing in TBAs, but maternal
   mortality rate has not reduced. TBAs are
   given basic training, and' are not
   equipped to handle complicated cases,"
   said Dr Khama Rogo.
        Annie Thairu and Rikka Trangsrud of
   Family Care International in their study
   Safe Motherhood in Kenya Initiative
   said: "Safe Motherhood Initiative has
   learned that training ofTBAs has not
   been found to have any measured impact
   on reducing maternal mortality, and the
   co-sponsors of the global initiative are
   now encouraging governments to invest
   in training of health professionals."
         In Kenya, maternal deaths stand at 650
   per 100,000 live births, making it one of
   the countries with the highest maternal
   mortality rates in the world, according to
   Safe Motherhood -lessons from 10 years
    of experience, a World Bank publication.
         The Bank's publication said even with
    training, TBAs cannot treat serious
    complications, and higher-level health
    providers with life saving skills are key
    to reducing maternal mortality.
         Gynaecologist, Dr Rogo argued that
    TBAs perform very few deliveries and
    the long intervals between cases makes it
    difficult for them to retain the knowledge
    received through training on how to
    ensure safe motherhood.
         Dr Rogo attended a meeting in
    Colombo, Sri Lanka to evaluate
    achievements since the launch of Safe
    Motherhood Initiative. The meeting                Medics examining a baby: As debate emerges over traditional birth attendants, proponents argue that with the TBAs, mothers can get frl e services or even settle

    and facilities at the hospitals, training of
     quality staff at these hospitals and
     improving the transportation system,"
     says Dr Rogo.
          Different views emerge from others
     who support the need to improve
     transportation and medical facilities but     traditional birth atterid4ints
     say this should not be done to the
     detriment of investment in TBAs.
