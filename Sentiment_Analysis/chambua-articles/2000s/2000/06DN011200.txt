Donde Bill: After
the euphoria, what?
  Sooner or later, the euphoria which greeted the passing of.the
  Bill calling for direct controls on bank interest rates will ebb.
      Whether or not Parliament did the right thing is now aca-
  demic, and we need not split any more hairs. All we can do is
  sit back and watch how the development              will impact on the
  money market, in both the long and the short term.
      Will loans become cheaper and more available to Ken-
  yans? Will commercial banks stop auctioning the property of
  defaulters?    Will our heavily-indebted        leaders and business-
  men borrow cheaply to refinance the big loans they owe the
  commercial banks?
    , We need to observe how the Bill's passage will impact em
  the other macro-economic         indicators - the exchange rate,
  inflation and the balance of payments.
      If, for instance, there is capital flight, as has been predict-·,
  ed, then we must, in the short run, expect a depreciated shil-
  ling. We live in a a global financial village in '!Vhich billions
  of dollars can move from one continent to another at the
  touch of a button .
 . The prospect of a depreciated          shilling is especially worri-
   some because, with oil prices already on an upward trend and

  petroleum prices.                                          ,
      During the euphoria characterising        the debate on the Bill, it
  was found expedient to bash the World Bank and the Interna-                Why epidemic spre:ads
  tional Monetary Fund. MPs had a field day criticising the
  policy of liberalisation      and looking for scapegoats       for ,our
',economic problems. The mood was captured by the Demo-
  cratic Party Chairman Mwai Kibaki, who declared that the
  Goyernment had "sold its soul to. foreign theories" ..                     despite the awareness
      It is one thing to thump the chest and seek scapegoats. But
  the reality     is that this economy badly needs the support of
  the IMF and the World Bank to turn around. Indeed, the
