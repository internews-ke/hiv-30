The Process adopted included:

sensitize them on existing HIV/AIDS policies, policy gap and the need to	fi	ll                               them.
		
•        Organising and facilitating a series of workshops in the provinces	to	provide                         AIDS
		
·workers and policy makers with skills and knowledge in policy

ACTION AND TALKING POINTS.

prevention activities, care and support of those infected and affected.		
		
•       Mandatory       testing and discrimination       has no room in the	pr	actice            of public health.
		
•       HIV/AIDS does not discriminate. Every one of us is affected and can	be	infected.                            In
breaking the silence, the political leaders have to be in the foref	ron	t.

WO	MEN             AND HIV/AIDS				
					
•	The vulnerability        of women       is greater than that of men beause                 01	th	e e	xis	ting       power
					
	imbalance       in relationships.				
					
	Women         have little control over their partners           and husbands           as far	as	se	xua	l          relation
	ships are concerned.				
•	Early marriaged        in our society/cultures        expose young women                more	to	HIV	in	fection             and
	having sex with older men thus increasing the risk if their partners are infected.				
	Forced sex e.g. rape, traditional rituals and practices. such as wife inheritance or wife				
	cleansing       increases     the risk of HIV infection.				
	Women are forced by circumstances                    of unemployment           and poverty an	d t	her	efo	re                  offer
					
	. sex for survival,     food, shelter, protection           and security.				
					
•	Risk of HIV infection         from unprotected            sexual intercourse        is as muc	h a	s 2	-4	times
					
	higher for women than men.				
					
					
					
CH	ALLENGES				
	Inequalities in society, family and at work e.g a girl in marriage                               is	in	her	ite	d       to another
	family and she should be allowed to inherll property there.				
					
•	Acceptance         that women        can make unilateral         decisions      regarding		her	se	xuality,
					
	fertility without     loosing face in the family and societal                context. This ha	s r	ele	van	ce                  to
					
	HIV/AIDS				
					
	•     In that women        Should be able to say no to a sexual relationship	tha	t i	s t	hreatening.
					
	•    Boosting women's self esteem to move them from acceptance                                  of	th	eir	Su	b-ordinate
	role without disrupting the social order.				
					
					
	The part that women             play in socialising        their mal.e children        in see	ing	th	eir	sisters and
					
	other females        as lesser people and they themselves                    being superior.				
					
					
	Sexual violence          directed     towards    women       because       of gender     stru	ggl	es,		misplaced
					
	sex value~ and deviant              and crimin!,1 manifestation           of these values.				
					
	Enforcement of laws in order to sort out gender and legal issues and refusing				to
	allow repugnant customary take the upper hand.				
					
	Integrating     the basic needs as basic rights in the constitutional                      f	ram	ewo	rk.	Basic
					
	needs include,        health food water, shelter, education                 information.				
					
	Kenya AIDS NGOs Consortium                    as a leading        partner   in this regard recogni	ses			that
	HIV/AIDS				
	in women poses a formidable challenge                     because of the many compounding				factors
	among them biological, social - cultural,                 economic and political perspectives.				
					
	Through       KANCO networking and policy fora both at National and District level, issues of				
	women        vulnt;raoility have been identifird as issues of concern. Information on these				
					
	issues is made available             at the Resource           Centre which have been accessed				to groups
					
	addressing         these issues.				
					
	Through       experience      sharing       in the network       meetings    capacity       needs	for	th	ose	respond·
	ing to these issues have been enhanced.				
					
	The Sessional          Paper No.4        of 1997; Aids in Kenya has inco-operatyed			wo	men     issues
	identified    through     policy advocacy           process.

	Women        have a critical       role to play in the care of the family, food production,d	eve	lop		
	ment activities' and also in influencing              who gets the votes during national				
	elections.     They have to be protected             from HIV/AIOS.

CU	RRENT                HIVIAIDS      SITUATION          IN KENYA				
AI	DS cases              in Kenya are increasing           at an alarming        rate. The cumulative				total of reported
AI	DS case is 87,000                  however,     it is estimated      that there are over 760,000				AIDS cases to-
da	te. About 700,000                deaths      due to HIV/AIDS         and related      conditions		hav	e b	een reported
in	Kenya by end of 1998. There are about 500 deaths                                 each day.				
•	There are 700,000            orphans     so far who desperately            need care and supp	ort			
	from the community. TO·date, there is no province                       in Kenya which is not				
	affected by HIV/AIDS.				
					
•	The prevalence        rates (number         of infections      occurring     in a given popul	ati	on		in a year)
	The National       AIDS and STDs Control              Programme            estimates     that	by	19	98,	the
	national HIV prevalence for adults had                    increased     t014%,      17 to 18%	in	Ur	ban	areas
	a~d to 12 • 13% in rural areas.				
	It is estimated       that so far we have about             1.9 million HIV infected				people
	healthy carriers) who in the next.few years will develop AIDS.The				chart below
	demonstrates    the distribution of AIDS cases by age and sex.
