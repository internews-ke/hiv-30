{"text": " 6\r\n DAIL Y\r\n NATION     Nairobi, Monday, December 4,2000\r\n Nassir must not get\r\n away with this folly\r\n  Cabinet Minister Shariff Nassir's reiteration yesterday that he\r\n  urged rioting youths on an arsonist rampage to hit back at other\r\n  riotous groups is both brazen and deplorable. It is also most\r\n  regrettable, coming from a stalwart of a Cabinet that not only\r\n  puts much store by collective responsibility     but whose head,\r\n  the President, is to be seen most Sundays in church and to be\r\n  often heard calling for religious and communal tolerance and\r\n  co-existence.\r\n     Mr Nassir's two greatest claims to prominence are precisely\r\n  that he is a member of the Cabinet and a political devotee of the\r\n  President's as a ruling party hard-liner. But he serves the inter-\r\n  ests of neither office when he calls press conferences          to\r\n  acknowledge that, yes, he did indeed add fuel to the fire of a\r\n. full-scale riot in Nairobi South B by telling Muslim youths \"not\r\n  to turn the other cheek\" and to retaliate to the burning of a\r\n  mosque in such a way as to outdo their perceived adversaries in\r\n  the scale of the outrage perpetrated against them.\r\n     And why did Mr Nassir, a Minister of State in the Office of\r\n  the President, engage in such incendiary bad advice bang in the\r\n  middle of a riot? He blithely says: \"I told the Muslim youth to\r\n  hit back with greater force if they are provoked because I am a\r\n  leader who is ready to sacrifice myself for my people and I do\r\n  not like cowards.\"\r\n     This incoherent would-be populism is the most grievous non-\r\n sense. Mr Nassir is ready to sacrifice absolutely nothing. In           COMMENT ARY\r\n fact, if every member of the Cabinet behaved the way Mr\r\n Nassir has done, and bragged about it at press conferences\r\n afterwards by speaking through both sides of their mouths, this\r\n country would be aflame from seaside cpast to lakeside coast          A toast to liberated men\r\n and all points North and South.\r\n     Mr Nassir's conduct is totally unacceptable. No Cabinet min-\r\n ister anywhere in the world, outside of a fascist regime (and\r\n so much of his deficiencies as a leader as of the sorry state Of\r\n there are virtually none of these left), could get away with Mr\r\n Nassir's actions and utterances of the past weekend. And if Mr        in the fight against Aids\r\n Nassir does indeed get away with it, this will be a reflection not\r\ngovernance and rule oflaw and decency in this country.\r\n   What happened at South B last week is to be deeply regretted\r\n                                                                       I've always had the nagging suspicion that                                                           and drug-related risk-taking.\"\r\non all sides and must not happen again anywhere in the coun-\r\n                                                                       what the world needs is not so much wom-                                                                Consider the story of Mr X, a profes-\r\ntry.
