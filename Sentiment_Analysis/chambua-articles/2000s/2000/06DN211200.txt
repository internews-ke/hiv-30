Give unity and
peace a chance
The hue and cry over Prof Yash Pal Ghai's mediation efforts
serve to prove one point. We need more men and women of his
calibre if we are to drag ourselves out of the morass of the
stalled constitution review process .
   .More than anyone else in and outside the establishment, Prof
Ghai stands out as a man who has Kenya's best interests at
heart and is not afraid to stick his neck out for the cause. This is
more than we can say for the pack of politicians who are
working day and night to scuttle his fledgling reconciliation
efforts ..
    It should be patently clear to anyone with a modicum of
patriotism that no on·e side of the stalemate will ever be able to
carry off constitution reforms on its own - not if the amend-
ments are to reflect the people's Will and also be grounded in a
democratic and legal framework.
    And yet we have hawkish politicians on both sides' of the
divide uttering words that amount to declaring that peace is the
last thing on their minds. Key among these agents of discord
are Kanu hardliners, such as Cabinet Minister Shariff Nassir,
who appears to have trouble accepting the fact of multi-party.

mutual suspicion that clouds genuine debate on the constitu-
