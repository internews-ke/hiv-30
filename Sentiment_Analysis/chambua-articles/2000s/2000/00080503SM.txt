{"text": "\ufeffSATURDAY AUGUST 5, 2000\r\nEDITORS NOTE\r\n\r\nThis week, a landmark precedent was set in our\r\nl courts. A ruling in which a judge had allowed a husband to\r\nI throw his HIV-positive wife out of the marital home\r\nII (notWithstanding the fact that his own HIV status is\r\nunknown) was overturned in the Court of Appeal. Let's\r\nignore, for the moment, the n.egat.ive impact this action\r\nwould have had on an otherwise healthy woman with two\r\nlittle children still dependent on her. Let's look at the\r\ninsensitivity of High Court Lady Justice Rawal's decision.\r\nThe fact is, if one spouse is HIV positive, the chances\r\nare substantially increased that the other spouse may also\r\ntest positive for the virus. For a husband to throw his wife\r\nout on these grounds is akin to throwing stones at your\r\nneighbour from inside a glasshouse. And for the judiciary\r\nto sanction such a negative, hateful, almostsE!~I~t\r\njudgement is morally offensive. Perhaps Lady JpstiCe\r\nRawal thought she was doing the right thin~bYiJhe\r\nhusband and the children; that byisolatihgthe~~spand\r\nand children from the 'soiledl11ember' oftheP?I,I~.ehold,\r\nthey would run lesser risk of being infected.' Pertll1 y\r\nJustice Rawal needs a little more education onHI\r\ntransmission. f\r\nIndeed, many of us do not understapdHIV~I'l~Aigs.\r\nBecause of this ignorance, HIV/Aids has become a\r\npolitical issue, rather than a persona.l,imorala . th\r\nissue, And it is primarily beca.useof this politiq g that\r\nindividuals suffer and succumb faster than they should to\r\nthese dreaded phenomena.\r\nWhich brings me to my next point; a HIV-positive\r\npatient is not doomed to die of Aids and is, is many cases,\r\na very healthy, vital being. However under situations of\r\nundue stress and unhappiness, the onset of Akis may be\r\nacce4erated; for the sake of their cNldren, at the very least,\r\nMr \u2018l-am-not-HIV-positive-too\u2019 should have thought of this.\r\nThe woman in question deserves alt the support she\r\ncan get from us. Often, when faced with such a situation,\r\nit\u2019s difficult enough to muster the strength to fight back.\r\nfl,9 )as chosen to fight for her rights and not sit back\r\nnsffp\u0161ty is laudable. This is an eye-opener for many who\r\n\u2018may be suffering silently. Now they know that they can\r\nstand up and fight this kind of injustice. Her lawyer, Abida\r\nAli-Aroni and the three Court of Appeal judges also\r\ndeserves a mention. The law must have a human face if\r\nwe are to believe in it\u2019s supremacy.\r\nRhoda Orengo"}
