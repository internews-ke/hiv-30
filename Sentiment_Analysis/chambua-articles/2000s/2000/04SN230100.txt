Mr Micah Cheserern assured Kenyans
that the government would do all in ils
power to reduce poverty and the spread of
Hl VfAids.

just-concluded I MF consultative meeting
in Gabon “includcd education. heali,. tbr
eign investments, reforms, conflict resolu
tion, marginalisation of the African conti
nent. poverty rcduction. unemployment
and wornens issues”
The IMF had established a poverty
reduction and ecominlic growth facility
spearheaded by heads of state of African
coimtries and stakeholdcrs.
Mr Chcscrem said many Kenyans were
living in poverty and this had led to the
spread of ¡-llV!Aids.
“Economic developnieiil is being ham
pered by the spread of WV/Aids among
the productive age group in the country,”
he said.
Ile said the IMF. African Development
Bank and the World Bank were ready to
work together with researchers on the cirn
rinent to develop a drug ftr H (V/Aids.
Mr Cheserern urged pharmaceutical
companies to make malaria and Aids drugs
more affordable.
He said leaders on the continent were
concerned about the cnf1icts in many
parts of the region which hindered eco
nornic growth.
A frican heads challenged the interna
tional bodies for their failure to respond to
the nflict,s on the continent as fast as
they do when it comes to Furópc and
America.
The governor asked those opposed to
the resumption of aid to Kenya to be real
istic and face the fact that most of the
citizers were living below the poverty line
and were dying of hunger and disease.
Pariiçipznts at the meeting expressed
concern over the poor trade ternis between
African countries a xl oilier parts of the
world.
Mr Cheserern challenged the Kenya
Association of M.nufacturers and thc
media to assist in the promotion of trade
in the region through advertising.
The role of wonen was emphasised
and leaders agreed to give them a greater
role in the development and democratisa
tion process.
Mr Chescrem added that a new mone
tary committee estahislied at the Ciabon
Conference would be holding meetings
every three years to deliberate on the dec
larations of the conference.
The Central I5ank chief said the IMF
was not out to force conditions l’or aid
resumption but would hold consultative
meetings with the gvernment on priori-
tics it has identified and which require
financial assistance in the areas identified
