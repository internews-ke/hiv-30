 started in India, focuses on giving children the opportunity to familiarise
 themselves with computers in an entirely infonnal setting.
       The 4-5-year-olds have the opportunity to work with graphic tools and create
 cartoonised alphabet and numbers. Those aged between 9-10 will be exposed to
 personal computers (PC), and how best to utilise them. The13-14-year-olds will
 learn video techniques like panning, zooming and much more.
       The course is divided into six age-appropriate modules.
       The programme hopes to attract school-going children who wish to have fun
 while learning. Through animation, they will be able to make their own alphabet
 choice.
       Suresh Kumar, the head of the programme, says the type of learning that
 will be offered will also make children kind to animals and the environment. The
 curriculllm has characters designed to promote responsibility.
      The programme schedules include summer (holiday) camps in which
 children will attend classes for two hours in 15 days.
      It also includes an annual one-hour a week session.
        Kavia Panna ,S, a pupil at Peponi Primary School, told the 'Young Nation'
 that the centre has a good atmosphere for children to become computer literate
 at primary school level.
      The 'self-learning' approach is expected to help the children realise their
 computer dreams.
