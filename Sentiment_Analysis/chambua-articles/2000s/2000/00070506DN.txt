What is -\r\n the purpose of the transfers? Are teachers justified in oppos-\r\n ing them? Is the timing right?\r\n     According to the government, the objective is to ensure\r\n even distribution of teacher~ throughout the country, on the\r\n premise that certain regions have an excess of teachers\r\n while the hardship areas, including arid and semi-arid lands,\r\n are understaffed.\r\n      For instance, a district like Meru Central has a surplus of\r\n  1,006 teachers while Kitui, in the same province, is under-\r\n  staffed by 488. Such anomalies must be redressed urgently.\r\n      After all, it is economically unjustifiable to have on the\r\n  payron teachers who are not productive, especially at a time\r\n  when the entire public service is being rationalised.\r\n      At any rate, all teachers sign a contract with the govern-\r\n  ment that obliges them to serve in any part of the country.             NEWS FEATURE\r\n  Which makes it ridiculous for the same teachers, through\r\n  their union officials, to turn around and reject transfers.\r\n      An issue that\" needs to be considered, however, is the              Mbeki -bashing ruled\r\n  timing. Procedurally, the Teachers Service Commission\r\n  transfers teachers at the beginning of it term to ensure conti-\r\n   nuity. Posting a teacher to a school in the middle of the term \"\r\n   disrupts learning programmes. It is for this reason that the\r\n   timing has been opposed. It is likely to be disruptive.                out at Aids talks in SA\r\n \" Though teachers swear to serve in all parts of the country,\r\n   there are certain mitigating circumstances that make it diffi-\r\n   cult for some to go and live in certain areas, including phys-\r\n   ical disability, poor health and marital considerations.                                                                                                              specifics relevant to our situation, which\r\n       The TSC, therefore, should rethink the whole issue of              President Thabo Mbeki's office has                                                             is characterised by high levels of poverty\r\n    transfers.
