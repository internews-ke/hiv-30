{"text": "6\r\nDAIL Y\r\nNATION\r\n     Nairobi, Tuesday, October 31, 2000\r\nZanzibar poll crisis\r\nshould be resolved\r\n It appears that Tanzania may not have learnt anything from\r\n the five years of acrimony and instability on its twin islands\r\n of Zanzibar and Pemba after the opposition rejected Presi-\r\n dent Salmin Amour's electoral victory.\r\n    The street battles and court tussles that eventually led to\r\ndonor suspension of aid seem to have taught little if what is\r\ngoing on in the general election on the isles is anything to go\r\nby. Already, the Electoral Commission has nullified results\r\nin 16 of Zanzibar's 50 constituencies.\r\n    The election is already tainted. Whoever wins will have to\r\nfight against allegations of vote-rigging and irregularities.\r\n    Granted, voting on the mainland this time round was gen-\r\nerally peaceful. But this is probably because the ruling party,\r\n Chama Cha Mapinduzi, knew that its candidate, President\r\nBenjamin Mkapa was assured of victory on the mainland.\r\nThe same could not be said of Zanzibar, where critics of the\r\nisland's Electoral Commission say the ruling party was see-\r\ning defeat, hence the chaos.\r\n    Zanzibar's Civic United Front, which claimed to have\r\nwon the 1995 poll, finds itself caught in a similar situation\r\nthis year.\r\n    The opposition candidate, Mr Seif Sharif Hamad, who                                                                     Succession debate: Who next?\r\nclaims to have won the 1995 poll, was pitted against the\r\nCCM candidate, Mr Amani Abeid Karume. This time round,               NEWS ANALYSIS\r\nZanzibar's President Amour, who won by a mere one per\r\ncent in 1995, was not on the ballot - having served two\r\nterms and perhaps not directly interested in ensuring a flaw-\r\nless poll.                                                          Mbeki goes on a charm\r\n    Some polling stations, however, opened five hours late,\r\nand closed promptly at 5 pm.\r\n    A CUF official in Zanzibar says the whole electoral proc-\r\ness is spoilt and wants fresh elections. Even before the poll,      offensive after Aids jibe\u00b7\r\nthere were fears that the tension on the island would not\r\nallow for a peaceful election. The opposition in Zanzibar is\r\nthirsty for victory, a fact that could have caused the tension\r\non the island on the days preceding the poll.\r\n    The feeling of bitterness is not entirely unfounded, and             BY BRENDAN BOYLE\r\nTanzanians on the islands and on the mainland must go into          South African President Thabo\r\ndeep soul-searching to understand the causes of the Zanzibar        Mbeki is leaving his comfort\r\nchaos.                                                              zone to confront his critics and\r\n    President Benjamin Mkapa must surely realise that the           arrest an alarming slide in support\r\nunfortunate events on the isles could seriously affect the          at home and abroad.\r\nprogress made by his government on the mainland.
