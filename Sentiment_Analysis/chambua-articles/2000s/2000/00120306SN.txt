{"text": "6\r\nSUNDAY\r\nNATION           Nairobi, December 3, 2000\r\nCrooks can wreck'\r\nreligious harInony\r\nWe cannot help but agree with the police that the violence\r\nwhich rocked Nairobi a few days ago and in :which churches\r\nand a mosque were burnt was sheer hooliganism.              This is\r\nbecause no evidence has emerged to show that this criminal\r\nbehaviour had been premeditated.\r\n   Although these shameful incidents are now taking on a reli-\r\ngious hue, there had not been any tinge of animosity between\r\nMuslims and Christians living in this area before the chaos\r\nbroke out. In fact, as the provincial administration      has clari-\r\nfied, there had been only a land dispute, which they promised\r\nto solve as soon as possible.\r\n   Therefore, it is significant the police have arrested 82 people\r\nsuspected to have been directly involved in causing the may-\r\nhem on Thursday and Friday. The public disappointment           over\r\nthe duration it took to quell the anarchy is understandable.     But\r\nthe critics are not entirely right in blaming the police for failing\r\nto bring the situation under control immediately.\r\n   The officers were faced with an unusually violent confronta-\r\ntionin     which some hoodlums hid behind alleged conflict\r\nbetween Christians and Muslims to unleash terror. It was a                                                                       \" \u2022.\u2022unity is possible!\"\r\ndelicate issue which needed proper handling so all the crooks\r\ncan be flushed out and punished for their part in the events of\r\nthe two days of shame.                                                 Poverty consultations\r\n   All those arrested should be thoroughly interrogated          and\r\ncharged in court as soon as possible. Of course, the police will\r\nquickly release from custody those who are innocent. It is\r\npossible in such circumstances       for the real crooks to escape\r\nwhile the innocent are made to suffer. What we would like to           not a bad idea after all\r\nsee is a transparent and impartial prosecution ..\r\n   However, in this whole confusion, it's noteworthy that some\r\nleaders from both the Christian and the Muslim faiths have\r\ncome out strongly against violence and revenge.
