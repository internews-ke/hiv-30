Crooks can wreck'
religious harInony
We cannot help but agree with the police that the violence
which rocked Nairobi a few days ago and in :which churches
and a mosque were burnt was sheer hooliganism.              This is
because no evidence has emerged to show that this criminal
behaviour had been premeditated.
   Although these shameful incidents are now taking on a reli-
gious hue, there had not been any tinge of animosity between
Muslims and Christians living in this area before the chaos
broke out. In fact, as the provincial administration      has clari-
fied, there had been only a land dispute, which they promised
to solve as soon as possible.
   Therefore, it is significant the police have arrested 82 people
suspected to have been directly involved in causing the may-
hem on Thursday and Friday. The public disappointment           over
the duration it took to quell the anarchy is understandable.     But
the critics are not entirely right in blaming the police for failing
to bring the situation under control immediately.
   The officers were faced with an unusually violent confronta-
tionin     which some hoodlums hid behind alleged conflict
between Christians and Muslims to unleash terror. It was a                                                                       " •.•unity is possible!"
delicate issue which needed proper handling so all the crooks
can be flushed out and punished for their part in the events of
the two days of shame.                                                 Poverty consultations
   All those arrested should be thoroughly interrogated          and
charged in court as soon as possible. Of course, the police will
quickly release from custody those who are innocent. It is
possible in such circumstances       for the real crooks to escape
while the innocent are made to suffer. What we would like to           not a bad idea after all
see is a transparent and impartial prosecution ..
   However, in this whole confusion, it's noteworthy that some
leaders from both the Christian and the Muslim faiths have
come out strongly against violence and revenge. The destruc-
