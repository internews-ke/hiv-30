infected with HIV and dying?"
she asks.
"Parents are not realising their
daughters are being coerced into
sex by older men. Poverty is certainly
an issue here as girls look
for money to support themselves.
As a woman, wife and
mother of two teenage daughters,
I care about protecting
young people. We must save
future generations. We do not
,inherit the earth from our parents
but we borrow it from our
children."
, She says it is coincidental that
she works for an organisation
which shares her values and
beliefs.
Lule holds a master's degree
in medical demography from the
University of London's School
of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
She has worked in Ivory
Coast, Nigeria, Swaziland,
Kenya and travelled across
Africa working.
Born and raised in llganda,
Lule says she has gone through
the usual process of bringing up
children but that her key has
been in having open communication
with her daughters and
discussing just about anything
without inhibition.
"Developing friendship with
your children and letting them
know you are always there for
them is what every parent needs
in order to bring up children,"
she says, cautioning that parents
should ,never let a gap develop
between them and their children.
She says she is however fortunate
to also have a large
extended but closely knit family
from whose advice her daughters
have benefited. She says there is
nothing wrong or embarrassing,
for parents answering questions
from their children on sexuality.
Mrs Lule says family is an
extremely important unit in society
"Respect, closeness and trust
are important values in family, a
fundamental institution to the
survival of humanity. I feel sad
the African extended family network
is breaking down. We
should preserve this institution
as it could help in dealing with
challenges like poverty and
Aids."
Mrs Lule says what she calls
assault on the African family -
soaring divorce and increasing
number of woman-headed families.
"To thrive, children need
two parents," she says. "Men
should also be more involved in
protecting families against
abuse, disease, child-raising and
empower women to make
decisions."
She says men should not feel
they are just breadwinners but
should also participate in child
rearing.
Married since 1976, Lule..says
she could not have been where
she is had her husband not supp<?
rtedher. "We were quite supportive
of each other: I stood
with and by him as he built his
accountancy career. He then
decided to help me advance my
career," she says.
She started as a university lecturer
then became a researcher
and then a programme manager.
Her husband, f:rederick Kironde
Lule, now works with the government
ot Uganda. "He's
participated fully in my carccr
development. Although he is
based in Kampala while I am in
Nairobi, he fully bchcvcs in my
work. Knowing that my husband
is fully behind mc and making a
difference in the lives of African
youth give me satisfaction and
the drive to work even hardcr,”
says the daughter-in-law of che
late Ugandan President, Prof
Yusuf Lule.
Mrs Lule, mother to two
children-Nagawa (20) and Wan-
yana (18)- says there
is more to be done to
save the next genera
tion. With almost half
of Africa entering ado
lescence, Pathfinder
supports programmes
to meet their reproduc
tive health. Adoles
cence is a time for
choices over who the
young people should be, and
what to do, where and with
whom. It is a time of testing lim
its while learning values and
restraint.”
Mrs Lule says the passage
from childhood to adulthood for
adolescents in sub-Saharm Africa
is complicated and fraught with
dangers like sexual exploitation,
substance abusè, violence, pover
ty, and crime. What is worse, no
source of reproductive health
information and counselling are
availabic duc to restrictive poli
cies and cultural harriers.
“Pathfinder believes young
people need allies and an envi
ronment that allows them to real
ise their full human potential. We
recognise that in a young per
sons universe, reproductive
health is not isolated from other
issues1” she says.
That Africa is the most youth
ful continent has serious implica
tions for her develõpment. It is
for this reason that Pathfinder
International is laying focus on
them.
Sub-Saharan Africa has
the
world’ s highest rate of
early child bearing and the
lowest. More than 50 per cent of the women
give birth before the age of 18.
Africa has more than 60 per cent
of the world’s HIV-infected per
sons. Of these, more than 50 per
cent are 15-24-year-olds. Yet.
because of culture, policy and
other barriers, these people are
the least likely to have access to
reproductive health information
and services.
To help them, says Lule, Path
finder has developed programmes
in Botswana, Liberia, Swaziland,
Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania,
Nigeria and Ethiopia. “We tackle
issues touching on married and
single, in school and out of
school, and sexually active and
inactive youth," she says.
"These programmes have been
designed and implemented in
collaboration with governments,
family planning associations,
public health institutions,
learning institutions, and
religious and community
~roups." They also reach pol-
ICY makers, parents, educators,
and community leaders with a
view to enabling them to
become collaborators in their
effort to assist the youth on
their sexuality. They are doing
this through film, she says.
Their fist movie, Consequences,
a 55-min 16-mm film
has been watched by 20 million
people across the continent.
It is in seven African languages
and appeals to youth
and parents alike.
To update Consequences,
Pathfinder has now created
Yellow Card, a 90-minute
35-mm film. '
"Yellow Card tackles male
responsibility in family planning,
life planning skills, prevention
of STD/HIV /AIDS,
sexual abuse and exploitation,
and coercion and violence
against women," says Mrs
Lule.
Mrs Lule says film promotes ,
open communication between
parents and their' children and
that the vanishing extended
family structure is complicating
matters.
