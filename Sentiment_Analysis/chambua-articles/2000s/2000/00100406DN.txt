{"text": "    6\r\n    DAll Y\r\n   NATION\r\n        Nairobi, Wednesday, October 4,2000\r\n   Rid City Hall of\r\n   stultlbling blocks\r\n    Nairobi Town Clerk Geoffrey Mate makes a very serious allega-\r\n    tion indeed when he accuses councillors and chief officers of\r\n    sabotage.\r\n       He tol~ jou,?alists on Monday that City Hall's politicians and\r\n    the functIOnanes had hatched a plot to frustrate the council's\r\n    restructuring programme. Without mentioning names, he added\r\n    the officers concerned wanted to cover up their misdeeds.\r\n       Internecine wars at the council are no longer news. Indeed, a\r\n   good number of its sessions have ended up in fisticuffs. But the\r\n   latest claims are unsettling for the simple reason that City Hall is\r\n   in dire need of reorganisation if it is to deliver effective services\r\n   to residents.\r\n       The council has been in the doldrums for longer than most\r\n   Nairobi residents care to remember. City infrastructure, including\r\n   schools and hospitals, are in a deplorable state of disrepair. The\r\n   council has more staff than it knows what to do with. Garbage\r\n   collection was such a nightmare that residents came up with their\r\n   own alternatives. Plot scandals, involving officers and council-\r\n   lors, have been too numerous to count. The litany of ills is long.\r\n      But, even as services have deteriorated, the council's capacity                                                                                                                               I\r\n   inefficiency ..\r\n   to collect revenue has been hampered by bureaucracy and sheer                                                                                                                                    ..\r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                    2000\r\n      Against this backdrop, Mr Mate's accusations of a conspiracy\r\n  to block reforms takes on very serious connotations. It is in the\r\n  interest of all parties that City Hall is cleaned up.                       COMMENTARY\r\n      Mr Mate needs to be very ruthless if he is to remain on track in\r\n  his efforts to implement the recommendations of the Mbugua\r\n  Report. Too often, the objectives of Govemment probe teams are\r\n  defeated by recalcitrant officials.\r\n      However painful restructuring, it will be worthwhile all round         Parliament should\r\n  if the result is to streamline services at City Hall. That will,\r\n  inevitably, mean job cuts and new operational systems and struc-\r\n  tures.\r\n      In that process, it will be absolutely necessary to redefine the                                                                                                                                        I\r\n tions at the council. Perhaps then we can see an end to press wars\r\n  working relations between chief officers and councillors.                  enact the Sugar Bill\r\n  Spheres of authority will have to be demarcated in black and\r\n white if we are to avoid the stalemates that have crippled opera-\r\n between the civil servants and the politicians.\r\n . ~hat everyone at City Hall needs to realise is that change is             We really must come up with some pol-                                                    decreed by bureaucrats    slttmg on arm)\r\n mevltable.
