           THE NAIROBI MILLENNIUM SYMPOSIUM
    About the Symposium
    Nairobi Central Business District Association proposes to hold a symposium under the
    theme "Recording History of the Millennium: The future is the responsibility of the current
    generation". The high profile symposium will be chaired by Head of Civil Service and
    Secretary to the Cabinet Dr. Richard Leakey and will be held on 17/212000 at The
    Grand Regency Hotel.
    Objective    of the Symposium
    The purpose of the symposium is to record the history of the millennium at its most lurid.
    moment. And, having celebrated the millennium in pomp and pageantry, Kenyans,
    especially Nairobi residents acknowledge their experience of the millennium is of historic
    importance. Our symposium is different from others previously held in that it seeks
    participation of the ordinary citizen; physical structures to enhance the beauty of the city;
    creation of jobs and making the city a little more people-friendly. This would be achieved
    in two ways:
