Ruling on HIV
wife a landmark
There can be nothing as callous, as insensitive and as crude
as a self-righteous human being dishing out judgment upon
his fellows as though he were God.
   Our Constitution forbids discrimination of any kind and,
although when it was framed, the Aids scourge was
unknown, discrimination on that ground, whether in the
workplace or in any social setting, is still patently illegal.
   That, obviously, implies that, on the domestic front, you
cannot discriminate against your spouse on account of his
or her HIV status unless the condition is such that one of
the spouses endangers all others in the family and, there-
fore, has to be physically removed from contact with the
rest. And the answer to that is hospitalisation, not some
kind of quarantine.
   That is why the ruling by three appellate judges that a
man who drove away his wife from her marital home to
live in their servant quarters because she had tested HIV
positive is a landmark.
    The judges were overturning an earlier ruling by a High
Court judge that denied the wife the enjoyment of her
human rights and even took away custody of their children.          NEWS ANALYSIS
The man, who works for an international company, had
sued for divorce after 10 years of marriage, and the judge
had agreed with him that the wife posed a grave threat to
his life.                                                           Did we sell our soul to
    The appeal judges ordered him to take her back, saying it
was morally wrong and insensitive for the woman, who
was contributing her share of the monthly mortgage pay-
ments, to be denied her rights by being confined to a single
room with only a simple bed and a cooker.                           get aid from the IMF?
    This judgment should set a precedent for cases of that
nature where abuse of human rights are visited upon hap-
 less people who, before Tuesday, had no idea where to turnÂ·
to. It is also a useful lesson for employers who may be                  By PETER MUNAITA                                                                                              from the domestic market every
