At least 2.2\r\n  million Kenyans - 14 per cent of the popula-\r\n  tion - are HIV -positive, while 600 others die\r\n  daily. The financial cost is immense and it\r\n  keeps rising. The government plans to spend\r\n  Shl4 billion to combat Aids - a paltry sum\r\n  against such a big national threat.\r\n     Equally sobering are the speeches by victims\r\n  and government officials who are only waking\r\n. up to the reality of Aids. Despite the \"wake-\r\n  up\" reaction and the willingness by the govern-\r\n  ment to spend, the feeling that the authorities\r\n  are not doing enough is gaining momentum.\r\n     Non-governmental organisations are ques-\r\n  tioning why Kenya, recently. listed as fifth\r\n  among the nations hardest hit by Aids, has\r\n  stuck to patent laws that other Third World,\r\n  including Bangladesh, -:[hailand and South\r\n  Africa, have modified their policies to accom-\r\n  modate their citizens' needs.\r\n     Aids activists, health experts and NGOs say\r\n  that in the long run, it will be cheaper for the\r\n  government to manufacture generic drugs than\r\n  spend billions of borrowed money on aware-\r\n  ness campaigns on citizens still dogged by cul-\r\n  tural beliefs and attitudes.
