According to the Welfare\r\n Monitoring Report of 1996, 52 per cent the Ken-\r\n yan population was considered as still living\r\n below the minimum poverty line.\r\n     The situation may be worse than the the report\r\n predicted. The economic performance has contin-\r\n ued to decline.\r\n     \"Kenya is also one of the countries in the region\r\n where poverty is most pervasive and economic\r\n growth one of the weakest.\" observes Elly Oduol,\r\n senior programme officer, United Nations Devel-\r\n opment Programme, UNDP Nairobi Office.\r\n      It is because this poverty that the HIV/AIDS\r\n situation in Kenya and Africa in general has\r\n become catastrophic.\r\n     According to an UNAlDS report of 1998, 90\r\n per cent of the 33.4 million people with HIV glo-\r\n bally live in sub-Saharan Africa.\r\n     As the world marked the International Day for\r\n the Eradication of Poverty on Tuesday, this week,\r\n it became more evident that to effectively fight\r\n  HIV/AIDS, the fight must start with poverty alle-\r\n viation or eradication of absolute poverty. \"AIDS\r\n should be seen more as a development issue than\r\n just a health issue.\" advises Oduol.\r\n     The hard economic times, that are further fuel-\r\n  ling poverty levels in Kenya, are in effect fuelling                                    A Students' march with a ballne,. that speaks vOlumes on bow to keep the Killer disease at bay.\r\n  the AIDS epidemic.
