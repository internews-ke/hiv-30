DC visits HIV/Aids patients

By NATION Reporter
The Isiolo District Commissioner
on Moi Day visited 131 women
infected with HIV.
Mr John Chege comforted the
women, many of them bedridden
and in poor health.
The DC's entourage in the visit
to the Pepo la Tumaini Jangwani
Centre, was moved to tears by 79
orphans, who sang songs entreating
wananchi to avoid
immorality,
Mr Chege appealed to Kenyans
not to shun or neglect HIV/Aids
victims but to take good care of
them.
The centre's co-ordinator, Ms
Adija Rana, appealed for donations
to enable the institution to
provide Aids victims with food,
clothes, health care and other
needs.
She said that some of the·
women at the centre had been
raped by bandits in various parts
of Isiolo and infected with the
deadly virus.
