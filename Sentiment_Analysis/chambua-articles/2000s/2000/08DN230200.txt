           On the verge of
           a breakthrough
          With one in every 13
          Kenyans believed to be
          infected with the virus
          that causes Aids, many
          hopes are pinned on a
          continuing       vaccine
          research.    Our writer
          JEFF OTIENO spoke to
          the reseach team and
