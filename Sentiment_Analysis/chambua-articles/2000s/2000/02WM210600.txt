DEATH OF INNOCENCE OR AGE OF KNOW - IT - ALLS?
Experts say parents are shocked to know how much their children know about sex.
The reaction is more often damaging. How do you talk to them about sex or their sexuality?

"I was shocked one day when I
went to check on the children in
the bedroom and I found my
seven- year-old son with a fouryear-
old niece in the same bed
kissing and ... I could not
believe my eyes. When they
noticed me, they jumped out of
bed and started begging me not
to beat them. Oh, so they knew it
was wrong!
I held them and 1 cried. God, I
asked, what is going on? 1 asked
them who taught them and they
started pointing fingers at each
other. The boy accused the girl...
I asked the girl and she told me
a neighbour's son back at home
had taught her.
What was even shocking was
to learn that my boy had been
shown this behaviour by a former
househelp . They shared the bedroom.
What is the world coming
to? I asked aloud. I broke down
and cried. When 1 pulled myself
together, I prayed for God's
forgiveness.
I asked the househelp whether
she had discovered anything
_ strange with the two and she told
me she had found them "doing
something bad" in the bathroom.
She had reprimanded them but
never told me. 1 realised how
naive I had been. The two loved
showering together. The girl
always asked the boy to scrub
her. I would hear giggling and
laughter - then silence in the
bathroom but I never thought
there was anything. After all they
are children."
Cynthia is nine years old and
she has a boyfriend. At class
three she understands many
things about sex but her parents
assume she is still too young to
be taught sexuality.
"I had a boyfriend when 1 was
in class one. He was in class four.
He would bring me gifts like
sweets, handkerchiefs and other
nice things that his mother
cooked. Then we would play "the
adult game." He thought me what
love was all about and learnt
about sex from him."
At seven, Maureen knew about
sex and getting babies. How did
she learn about it?
"We had a neighbour who was
newly married. We played with
older children who told us what
they did when they locked their
door. We watched through a hole
on the door and saw everything.
Soon she was pregnant and got a
child and the older children
explained to us the process of
getting a baby."
When George was five he was
told about the condom and how it
is used. "We played with them as
balloons but we knew what they
were. A boy who gave us the
condoms for inflating took them
from his mother, a social
worker.
Paul and Josh were playing at
the court outside their house
when a neighbour's son in secondary
school decided to show
them a blue movie.
"I was amazed at the things I
watched. Every time I watched
the door thinking my mother will
walk in and strangle me. This
is when I told Josh that we
should leave. The image
remained with me for a long
time and every time I saw a
girl, I imagined how she
looked without clothes," says
Paul, then six.
Nursery and lower primary
school children are knowledgeable
about sex, says Ben
Kamau, a teacher at a Nairobi primary
school.
"When you mention something
to do with reproduction, the girls
giggle and the boys are excited.
They are not like us when we
gre~ up without knowing these
things. They can explain to you
the process of love-making until
you are shocked. I guess they
watch television a lot."
While still in nursery school,
Rowena was exposed to adult literature.
At five, she knew about
sex.
"I-left school at noon every day
and there was nobody to play
with. I watched television or read
my parents' books which were
full of explicit sex topics. By the
time I reached class one, I would
read David Maillu's pornographic
books," says 17-year-old
Rowena.
She says her parents did not
know how to choose children's
books and left their books where
she would fintl them and read.
Charles was in class three when
other boys laughed at him that he ,
had not had sex. He was ashamed.
Now in class four, he has a
girlfriend in class two.
"Very young girls talk about
sex and they provoke boys to
seduce them," says the shy
10-year-old.
Mathew was introduced to sex
by a househelp long before he
went to school. She would call
him from his friends and ask him
to assist her in folding clothes.
"In the process she would put
me on top of her and what fo]-
lowed I never understood until
much ]ater."
With explicit television programmes
and well informed
friends, young children are
exposed to sex very early.
Mrs Anne Mutua, a counselling
teacher at Nairobi Girls says
parents must talk to their children
about sex as soon as they are able LU .• ' "-
to understand.
"Some parents assume that
their children are too young to
know about sex or their sexuality.
Other parents start telling their
daughters about menstruation
long after the onset of their periods.
It is awkward then because
the girls have already learnt from
friends."
Experts say parents will be
shocked to know how much their
babies know about sex. "Parents
think that their children are the
innocent babies they were changing
diapers not long ago. But with
vast information, even four-yearold
children know too much
about sex."
However, some parents use a
crude approach in warning their
children about sex.
"My mother told me that if! let
a boy touch me I would get pregnant
or get Aids. Then 1 was
seven and I had been told about
Machine generated alternative text: Dear Amani,
daughters about menstruation
long after the onset of their peri
ods. It is awkward then because
the girls have already learnt from
friends.”

“My mother told me that if I let

menstruation and pregnancy by
older girls. I thought my mother
was a liar and when I was 10, 1
did it with my boyfriend to prove
her wrong,” says Catherine, aged
13.
This does not work since the
children are already quite
informed. However, parents can
stop this trend, says counsellor
and nurse Florence Ngaira of
Peace Medical Clinic.
“Parents should now take it
upon themselves to open up to
their children about sex when
they are still young. Many par
ents leave their children to grow
up without knowing the dangers
or significance of sex. When the
knowledge comes from their par
ents it is not misleading as when
it comes from friends.”
Michael Moloney, Director
Amani counselling Centre, says
it’s wrong to discipline four year
olds if you find them kissing or
touching private pans. “If you
spank them, you will leave them
confused. They will wonder why
you are so upset.”
“Don’t panic, he advices.
“Open a dialogue so that they can
tell you how, who showed them.
Build it up into a learning experi
ence. Tell them why it’s not
proper to touch each other’s geni
tals and why they should avoid
watching sexy videos or pro
grammes.
Children, he says, are curious.
After all, they watch these sexy
scenes every day on TV pro
grammes aired long before bed
time. They touch each other the
way they would touch a teddy
bear or a doll. Deal with the
sources of influence intelligently,
he advices.
I know this lady who was in
love with a man and they
moved together for a couple of
years. Then somehow they
split and the man found
another girl friend and the
lady found another friend too.
However one day they hap
pened to meet in a bar and the
old boy friend started abusing
his former girlfriend and then
he beat her up.
My question ¡s, does this
show that he really loved her
and didn’t want her to go in
the first place? .
Concerned Lady.
Dear Concerned Lady,
Thank you for your lcttcr. Some
readers may be surprised that
you would even ask such a ques
fon, others may still need to
know if there is a connection
between beating someone and
loving them.
It is a fact that when parents
beat a child they may say to
themselves and even to their
child, I am just doing this for
your own good and because
really I love you and you need
to learn a lesson.
Similarly, a spouse (it is usu
ally, but not always, the man)
may say ‘1 love you and that is
why I am teaching you this les
son,’ or, as is the case in the let
ter you have written - “I used to
love you and I am beating you
to show how angry I am that
you left.”
It is only a perverted view of
love which expresses itself
through beating the loved per
son. Any normal child who is
beaten does not believe that this
is an act of love. When beating
. is a part of family life, it may
produce outward obedience but
inwardly there will be resent
ment and even hatred and the
child will learn to lie and
deceive in order to avoid being
beaten.
Dear Concerned Lady, in the
example you have given the
beating is nothing more than a
display of power. The woman
becomes an object to be pos
sessed and used. She is there for
the benefit of the man If she
leaves then it is her Iauh. No
one else has any rights over the
former girlfriend. If she is seen
with anyone else then jealousy
and anger produce physical vio
lence.
Anyone who thinks that being
beaten is the sign of another’s
Love is in danger of entering into
an abusive relationship.
Love, in every culture, is
shown through concern, under
standing and respect for the
partners. There is nothing manly
or attractive in beating up a
woman. It is not a sign of
strength but of weakness.
Your friend is to be congratu
kited for splitting from an abu
sive relationship.
