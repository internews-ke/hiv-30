Even street boys joined in the dancing.\r\n      It was all in an event organised by Artnet to\r\n  create Aids awareness among the youth. The\r\n  group has been holding drama and dance extrav-\r\n  aganzas to disseminate        knowledge      on the\r\n  scourge.\r\n     The action started with a procession being\r\n  flagged off at the Kaptembwa Chiefs Camp.\r\n  Dancers led the human and motor convoy from\r\n  the venue, through Nakuru's streets and finally\r\n  to an open-air auditorium at Shaabab estate.\r\n     As the procession snaked through the town, it\r\n  swelled as curious onlookers joined the colourful\r\n  event, which is exactly what the organisers had\r\n  in mind.\r\n     Action proper kicked off at the Shaabab\r\n  grounds with more than 10 groups taking to the\r\n  stage. An array of oral narratives, verses, songs,\r\n  dances and plays were then staged to the cheer-\r\n  ing audience. And all with one message: Aids\r\n  kills.\r\n      But it was the comedies that ultimately carried\r\n  the day. Performed by Artnet's Nyatop comedi-\r\n  ans and Vitimbi comedians from Nairobi, the\r\n  audience was tickled. Though aimed at commu-\r\n  nicating the Aids message, the acts were a lot of\r\n  fun.
