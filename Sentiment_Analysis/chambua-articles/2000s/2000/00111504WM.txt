{"text": "\ufeffDAILY NATION, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 15,2000\r\n\r\nNEVER TOO YOUNG FOR A WALK IN THE NIGHT\r\n\r\nBY JAMES MIRITI\r\nIt'spast midnight and a\r\ngroup of underage .girls\r\nare gathered outside a\r\nnightclub in Chuka town.\r\nUnmoved by the harsh\r\nweather, the shabbilydressed\r\ngirls can be heard' discussing\r\nthe night's prospects. The\r\noldest among them, 14-year-old\r\nJackline Gatwiri, is trying to\r\ncheer them up. \"Things haven't\r\nalways been this bad,\" she\r\nassures them, but is quick to add\r\nthat perseverance is a must in\r\ntheir new trade.\r\nTrue to her prediction, a\r\nvisibly-drunken man emerges\r\nfrom the shadows and after a\r\nshort discussion leads the youngest\r\nof them, ll-year-old Angela\r\nGatune, away.\r\nIn Meru South district, hundreds\r\nof underage girls are being\r\npushed into prostitution by worsening\r\neconomic conditions, over-\r\n; loaded school curriculum, and a\r\nculture that has always treated\r\nwomen as second-class citizens.\r\nThree months ago, Angela was\r\nan innocent 11- year-old child\r\nwho liked to play hide-and-seek\r\nwithin the security of her mothers\r\nhouse in the drought-hit Mutino\r\nvillage in Tharaka Division. But\r\nas the impact of drought sunk in,\r\nher family decided to remove her\r\nfrom school so she could seek\r\nemployment to help feed her family\r\nand also educate her two\r\nbrothers.\r\nAfter a week of wondering\r\nfrom house-to-house looking for\r\nemployment, she found herself in\r\nChuka town with no job, money,\r\nshelter or security, That's how\r\nshe became part of Gatwiri's\r\ngroup; the offer of shelter and\r\nfood was too tempting for a hungry\r\ngirl to resist.\r\nOnce considered a universal\r\ncrime, the trade in children's\r\nflesh is increasingly being\r\nregarded simply as a business,\r\nwith support from tour agencies,\r\naffluent travellers, outdated tradi-\r\n.tions and even from governments\r\nwhich have failed to enact effective\r\nlaws to safeguard children,\r\nespecially girls.\r\nAs early as 1994, World Watch\r\nmagazine had warned that child\r\nprostitution had become a multibillion-\r\ndollar industry and that\r\nchildren were being traded like\r\ncommodities. Although Kenya is\r\nyet to gain the notoriety of the\r\nworld's leading capitals of the\r\nchild sex industry, evidence\r\nshows that the number of underage\r\ngirls peddling sex for a living\r\nis increasing at an alarming rate\r\nboth in towns and villages.\r\nAt 14 years, Gatwiri is already\r\na seven-year-old veteran of the\r\nstreets. Born in the slums of Nanyuki\r\ntown, she ventured into the\r\nstreets at seven. Seven years later,\r\nshe claims to have slept with an\r\nuncountable number of men, procured\r\nfour abortions and is a veteran\r\nof Kenyans juvenile remand\r\nhomes. As far as she can remember,\r\nher only contact with formal\r\neducation was her frequent visits\r\nto Nanyuki schools to scavenge\r\nfor left-overs which was her main\r\nupkeep.\r\nIs she aware of HIV/Aids and\r\nthe dangers she has been exposing\r\nherself to? \"Over the years, I\r\nhave watched many of my friends\r\nsuccumb to a myriad of illnesses,\"\r\nshe admits but quickly adds\r\nthat 90 per cent of her customers\r\nwill not agree to use a condom.\r\nAccording to the Progress of\r\nsexuality in Meru South District.\r\nOne of the volunteers, Kenneth\r\nMurithi, says that as many as 50\r\nper cent girls in this age category\r\nhave misperception about risks of\r\ncontracting Aids. He says that\r\nthe majority of men seeking sex\r\nwith underage girls are mainly\r\nmotivated by a misplaced desire\r\nto protect themselves from the\r\ndisease since they believe that\r\nyoung girls are free of the virus.\r\n\"On the contrary, most of the\r\ngirls roaming the streets suffer\r\nfrom many forms of sexually\r\ngroup has 16 members ranging\r\nbetween 11 and 14 years. \"Hunting\"\r\nin a pack ensures their surviva~'\r\nshe says. When a member\r\nis arrested, they are able to contribute\r\nmoney to bail her out and\r\nthey are also able to keep track of\r\nthe whereabout of each group\r\nmember. This is because Some\r\nmen are known to collect girls\r\nfrom the streets and lock them up\r\nin secret houses where they are\r\nused as sex slaves.\r\nGatwiri says their greatest enemies\r\nare the police and older\r\nprostitutes who attack and rob\r\nthem, accusing them of undercharging\r\ncustomers and thus\r\ndowngrading the business. \"But\r\nthey are only jealous because we\r\nattract more attention,\" she adds.\r\nShe also cites cases ofuncooperative\r\ncustomers who demand\r\nodd forms of sex \"but are unwilling\r\nto pay for the extra risks\". To\r\nthem rape is an initiation.\" Many\r\ntimes, a member of our groups\r\nturns up gang-raped and assaulted\r\nbut we are helpless since we cannot\r\nturn to the police for protection,\"\r\nshe says.\r\nBut not all underage girls are\r\npushed to the streets by economic\r\ndifficulties.\r\nLillian Muthoni comes from a\r\nrelatively well-off family. Her\r\nfather is a teacher and also a\r\nfarmer. She claims she was\r\nfor~e9 to run away from home\r\nwhen school life became difficult.\r\nA slow learner, she was forced to\r\nrepeat classes and was still in\r\nclass five when her peers were\r\nsitting for standard eight examination.\r\nToday she blames her uncompromising\r\nfather and teachers\r\nwho she claims had reduced her\r\nto a laughing stock among the\r\nschool community. Although she\r\nreadily agrees that life at home\r\nwas more comfortable and lesshazardous,\r\nshe is not ready to go\r\nback and has shaken off several\r\nattempts by her parents to take\r\nher back.\r\nAs troubling as\u00b7 it may sound,\r\nthe explosion of child prostitution\r\nin Kenya boils down to market\r\nforces of supply and demand. A\r\ncommunity destabilised by HIVAids\r\npandemic, increasing poverty\r\namidst political lmcertainty\r\nand the rapidly-widening gap\r\nbetween the rich and the poor is\r\nproducing more potential victims\r\nand more: potential exploiters of\r\ninnocent children.\r\nIn the world of child prostitution,\r\nno story is more heartwrenchin\"\r\nthan that of a child\r\nwho has 'been deceived or forced\r\nby violence into the trade. But it\r\nis perhaps more tragic when parents\r\nwho have no criminal record\r\npush their daughters to the streets\r\nto fend for themselves.\r\nIn Kenya today, a boy is more\r\nlikely to get basic education than\r\na girl. With little prospects of\r\nmaking it in any other field, a girl\r\nchild will easily be enticed by\r\nmen into early sex and if anything\r\ngoes wrong, they turn to the\r\nstreets to earn a living.\r\nUnfortunately, those who end\r\nup in the streets experience a\r\nworld that alternately uses and\r\nrejects them. Passed from the\r\nsecurity of their homes into the\r\nhands of sex-crazed men, many\r\nchild prostitutes are not empowered\r\nenough to feel wronged by\r\nsociety. Their predominant feeling\r\nis fear of being abused by the\r\nnext customer and a shame of\r\nbeing involved in a dirty trade."}
