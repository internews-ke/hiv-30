,Aids street fete a huge success
             By ANTHONY           NJAGI
  The theatre focus was on Nakuru Town last
  weekend where the National Artnet Aids Youth
  festival brought activities in the streets to a near
  standstill. Even street boys joined in the dancing.
      It was all in an event organised by Artnet to
  create Aids awareness among the youth. The
  group has been holding drama and dance extrav-
  aganzas to disseminate        knowledge      on the
  scourge.
     The action started with a procession being
  flagged off at the Kaptembwa Chiefs Camp.
  Dancers led the human and motor convoy from
  the venue, through Nakuru's streets and finally
  to an open-air auditorium at Shaabab estate.
     As the procession snaked through the town, it
  swelled as curious onlookers joined the colourful
  event, which is exactly what the organisers had
  in mind.
     Action proper kicked off at the Shaabab
  grounds with more than 10 groups taking to the
  stage. An array of oral narratives, verses, songs,
  dances and plays were then staged to the cheer-
  ing audience. And all with one message: Aids
  kills.
      But it was the comedies that ultimately carried
  the day. Performed by Artnet's Nyatop comedi-
  ans and Vitimbi comedians from Nairobi, the
  audience was tickled. Though aimed at commu-
  nicating the Aids message, the acts were a lot of
  fun.                                                       Members of Mia Chake drama group perform during the Artnet Aids festival in Nakuru.                Right, a street boy joins in the action with his own jig.
