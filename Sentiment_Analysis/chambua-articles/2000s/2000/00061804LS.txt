{"text": "\ufeffThe Sunday'Nation, June 18,2000\r\n\r\nAIDS VIRUS MAY HAVE RESULTED FROM A 1950S POLIO VACCINE\r\n\r\nBy DENNIS ONYANGO\r\nA merican and European scientists are get\r\nting back to their labs to test a vaccine\r\ndeveloped more than 40 years ago, that\r\nsorne say could have been the source of\r\nthe now unmanageable Aids.\r\nGrudgingly, the scientists will conduct tests in\r\nthree laboratories to determine if an experimental\r\noral polio vaccine administered in 1957 could have\r\ncarried the virus that led to Aids. Results are\r\nexpected soon.\r\nVjstar Institute, a research centre in Philadel\r\nphia, United States, manufactured the vaccine in\r\nthe 1950s and kept in frozen form a sample of the\r\nmaterial used. That sample will now be used to test\r\na theory some American newspapers say is \u201cim\r\nprobable\u201d and some doctors call \u201cfar-fetched.\u201d\r\nSceptics long charged that the oral polio vaccine\r\ntried in the then Belgian Congo in the l950s was\r\npossibly made with chimpanzee tissue that might\r\nhave been contaminated with the ancestor of the\r\nAids virus.\r\nNow, under pressure. Wistar is sponsoring scien\r\ntists back to the laboratories hoping to prove there\r\nis no truth in the claims. But scientists also say that\r\nsome hell could break loose should it be proved\r\nthai chimpanzee tissue was used.\r\nAmerica\u2019s Centre for Disease Control and Pre\r\nvention however says finding the chimpanzee\r\nDNA will not prove that the vaccine carried virus\r\nes. The theory will have been proved if the scien\r\ntists find an Aids-like virus in the samples.\r\nThere are other complications. Scientists say that\r\nthe virus could still be there even if the tesis do not\r\ndetect it.\r\nThere has been some simmering row about thai\r\nvaccine for close to 40 years now. The concerns\r\nbecame more pronounced in early 1992 following a\r\nstory ifl Rolling Stone magazine that also\r\ndemanded the tests be conducted.\r\nIn an article published on March 19, 1992, titled\r\n\u201cOrigins of Aids,\u201d the magazine suggested that tri\r\nals of a live polio virus vaccine in present-day\r\nCongo possibly caused Aids.\r\nAssembling details that sounded as logical as\r\none could probably get then, the magazine argued\r\nthat the vaccine was grown in primary monkey\r\nkidney cell cultures. It said contamination of these\r\ncultures could have led to inadvertent inoculation\r\nof Aids virus.\r\nThe pressure forced the Wistar Institute to\r\nappoint an independent Committee of scientists to\r\nInvestigate the concerns. The committee of six\r\ndoubted that there was any truth in the claims. Still,\r\nit recommended that the vaccine be tested.\r\nThe committee also recommended that the ori\r\ngins of the monkey kidneys used for growing the\r\nvaccines be made clear because it mattered.\r\nAsian monkeys were said to be free of Aids-\r\nrelated viruses, unlike the African monkeys. Even\r\ntoday, the committee said, African Green monkey\r\nkidneys are still used to prepare the polio vaccine.\r\nThe team observed that at the time of the polio\r\nvaccine\u2019s preparation, the Jndian government had\r\nput an embargo on all monkey exports. This\r\nincreased the chances that African monkeys were\r\nused.\r\nWistar was reluctant to implement the Commit\r\ntee\u2019s recommendations citing lack of scientific\r\ninterest. Only the US Centre for Disease Control\r\nand Prevention was ready to conduct the tests, yet\r\nthe tests required more than one lab for control\r\nfindings.\r\nBut greater pressure came in late last year when\r\na British journalist published a book that resur\r\nrected demands for the testing of the vaccine. The\r\nBBC correspondent, who is also a former UN offi\r\ncial, raised some hard questions on the rise of Aids.\r\nJ n The River: A Journey ro \u00a1he Source of H!V\r\nand Aids, (Little Brown, September 1999),\r\nEdward Hooper examined the scientific activi\r\nties of one American and one Belgian doctor\r\nin the modem-day Congo, Rwanda and Burundi in\r\nthe mid 1950s.\r\nHe traced some of the earlier blood samples col\r\nlected from patients .in the Central Africa region\r\nand taken to American and Belgian laboratories.\r\nThe writer also examined some three deaths that\r\noccurred in three separate places: George Y. \u2018s\r\ndeath in Toronto, David Carr\u2019s in Manchester and\r\nArdouin A.\u2019s in New York in 1959. He says these\r\ncould be the earliest Aids-related deaths.\r\nHe talked to the doctors and hospital assistants\r\nwho handled the patients. In some cases, he looked\r\nat the autopsy reports on these patients; I-looper\r\ngathered evidence -of similar medical complications\r\nin the three cases and the fact that their doctors did\r\nnot know exactly the causes of the complications\r\nand eventual death. Quoting obituaries and\r\nexchanges between Albert Sabin and Hilary\r\nKoprowski. two doctors who were centrally\r\ninvolved in the development and administration of\r\nthe oral polio vaccine, I looper established titar at\r\nsorne stage, Sabin got more concerned about Aids\r\neven as he concentrated his efforts on polio.\r\nIn an article published in Nature magazine two\r\nweeks after his death, Sabin argued that attempts to\r\nvaccinate against Aids would not succeed. Accord\r\ning to Hooper, both doctors had developed their\r\nown sets of oral polio vaccines. The US was about\r\nto approve either Sabin\u2019s or Koprowski\u2019s.\r\nThe writer says that stakes were getting higher.\r\nWhichever vaccine the US approved was likely to\r\nbe adopted globally. Referring to the proceedings at\r\nthe First International Conference on Live Poliovi\r\nrus Vaccines, Hooper quotes Dr Sabin saying that\r\nhis rival\u2019s vaccine, which had been fed to about\r\n300,000 people in Congo, had been contaminated\r\nwith a virus that had nothing to do with polio.\r\nHe quotes Dr Sabin as sayin that the vaccine\r\nkilled cells when introduced into monkeys. A\r\nSwedish virologist came to Koprowski\u2019s defence.\r\nBefore this confrontation, Hooper says, Sabin had\r\npublished the same concerns in the British Medi\r\ncal Journal.\r\nA section of the obituary quoted in (he book\r\nrecognises that the question of selection of polio-\r\nvirus to be used in human beings strained the rela\r\ntionship between the two pioneer polio doctors.\r\nBut at the end, the obituary quoted Dr Sabin\r\nWriting to his rival that speculations that Aids\r\nbegan with the polio virus were irresponsible, giv\r\ning the impression that before he died, he had rec\r\nonciled with Koprowski.\r\nIn 1992, Rolling Stone argued that Dr Sabin\u2019s\r\nvaccine had been used in Eastern Europe in sugar\r\ncubes unlike Dr Koprowski\u2019s that was distributed\r\nin Central Africa in its more or less raw nature.\r\nThese differences, the magazine argued, could\r\nexplain why earlier cases of Aids are traced to\r\nAfrica and not Europe.\r\nScientists however contend the exercise would\r\nbe futile because it is not certain that what is to be\r\ntested is a truc sample of what was given to the\r\npeople of Congo. In his book, Hooper says the\r\nvaccine\u2019s experiment in Africa had terrible and\r\ntragic consequences.\r\nWistar Institute dispatched the polio vaccine to\r\nan independent laboratory that will divide it\r\nbetween three or four other laboratories. The vac\r\ncine will be hand delivered to the participating lab\r\noratories in April.\r\nResearchers will be looking for an Aids-related\r\nvirus in the animal tissue used in the vaccine.\r\nAccording to a report in The New York Times,\r\nscientists have retrieved I-11V from blood that had\r\nbeen stored t\u00f2r decades. That indicates they could\r\nproduce reliable results using the stored vaccine.\r\nBut a lot depends on the quality of the stored\r\nmaterial.\r\nLaboratories ran by the US Government arc\r\nbarred from conducting the test, so are laboratories\r\nbased in Philadelphia. [tooper\u2019s book is (he most\r\nsystematic but diplomatic attack on medical experts\r\narid scientists for refusing to test the theory that\r\ntheir activities may have caused the most devastat\r\ning disease in the history of mankind.\r\nScientists have long agreed that 1-11V is a\r\ndescendant of an SIV virus carried by African chim\r\npanzees. Hooper agrees with this.\r\nB ut he differs with thc scientists on how this\r\nvirus jumped from chimpanzees to\r\nhumans. Some scientists have said it was a\r\nnatural transfer through human-\r\nchimpanzee contacts. Some have suggested that\r\nsome Africans kept chimpanzees for pets. Others\r\nsay the virus spread when people hunted and\r\nskinned chimpanzees for food.\r\nThe scientists argue . that Aids spread only\r\nrecently because of changes in Africa involving\r\nmigrations resulting from the Second World War\r\nand the end of colonialism. Using maps, I-looper\r\nestablishes very close links between the I 950s\u2019 vac\r\ncinations and early Aids.\r\nEven as scientists get back to the laboratories,\r\nanother group that claims that H1V does not cause\r\nAids is forcing its way into high places, posing\r\nanother challenge to the conventional Aids wisdom.\r\nThe Aids debate is also becoming more political.\r\nSome University of California professors have\r\nmaintained that there is no link between HIV and\r\nAids. Charles Gcshcktcr, professor of African His\r\ntory, David Rasnick a biochemist and Peter Ducs- .\r\nberg, professor of biochemistry and molecular biol\r\nogy support this theory. They say Aids is caused by\r\nrecreational drug use and malnutrition."}
