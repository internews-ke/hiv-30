   Jhe .signi~g of the. Burundi peace accord in Arusha yester-
   day IS amllestone m that country's troubled history. Thanks                                                                                                  \
   to that indefatigable elder statesman, former South African
   President Nelson Mandela, the people of Burundi may know
   peace and stability which has proved elusive for decades.
      ~S President Bill Clinton's presence in Arusha added
   pOignance to that momentous accord. Few American presi-

      Unfortunately, the failure by some Tutsi parties to sign
  -the pact may mean the process aborted, though, at the end of
   the day, it may not matter much.
      In fact, it is not at all certain that the accord will hold
   considering that it was not accompanied by a ceasefire, and
   the fact ~hat ~uru~di President Pierre Buyoya has put his job
   on the hne m thts matter. He faces great opposition back
   home, especially from his own people, the Tutsi, who do not
   want to make any concessions whatsoevE:r to the majority
   Hutu. So it is to the man's credit and a sign of courage that
   he left Burundi at all.
      The acco~d is the culmination of two years of talks
   betw~en mamly Hutu rebels and the government. It is meant
