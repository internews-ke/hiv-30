Poverty is certainly\r\nan issue here as girls look\r\nfor money to support themselves.\r\nAs a woman, wife and\r\nmother of two teenage daughters,\r\nI care about protecting\r\nyoung people. We must save\r\nfuture generations. We do not\r\n,inherit the earth from our parents\r\nbut we borrow it from our\r\nchildren.\"\r\n, She says it is coincidental that\r\nshe works for an organisation\r\nwhich shares her values and\r\nbeliefs.\r\nLule holds a master's degree\r\nin medical demography from the\r\nUniversity of London's School\r\nof Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\r\nShe has worked in Ivory\r\nCoast, Nigeria, Swaziland,\r\nKenya and travelled across\r\nAfrica working.\r\nBorn and raised in llganda,\r\nLule says she has gone through\r\nthe usual process of bringing up\r\nchildren but that her key has\r\nbeen in having open communication\r\nwith her daughters and\r\ndiscussing just about anything\r\nwithout inhibition.\r\n\"Developing friendship with\r\nyour children and letting them\r\nknow you are always there for\r\nthem is what every parent needs\r\nin order to bring up children,\"\r\nshe says, cautioning that parents\r\nshould ,never let a gap develop\r\nbetween them and their children.\r\nShe says she is however fortunate\r\nto also have a large\r\nextended but closely knit family\r\nfrom whose advice her daughters\r\nhave benefited. She says there is\r\nnothing wrong or embarrassing,\r\nfor parents answering questions\r\nfrom their children on sexuality.\r\nMrs Lule says family is an\r\nextremely important unit in society\r\n\"Respect, closeness and trust\r\nare important values in family, a\r\nfundamental institution to the\r\nsurvival of humanity. I feel sad\r\nthe African extended family network\r\nis breaking down. We\r\nshould preserve this institution\r\nas it could help in dealing with\r\nchallenges like poverty and\r\nAids.\"\r\nMrs Lule says what she calls\r\nassault on the African family -\r\nsoaring divorce and increasing\r\nnumber of woman-headed families.\r\n\"To thrive, children need\r\ntwo parents,\" she says. \"Men\r\nshould also be more involved in\r\nprotecting families against\r\nabuse, disease, child-raising and\r\nempower women to make\r\ndecisions.\"\r\nShe says men should not feel\r\nthey are just breadwinners but\r\nshould also participate in child\r\nrearing.\r\nMarried since 1976, Lule..says\r\nshe could not have been where\r\nshe is had her husband not supp<?\r\nrtedher. \"We were quite supportive\r\nof each other: I stood\r\nwith and by him as he built his\r\naccountancy career. He then\r\ndecided to help me advance my\r\ncareer,\" she says.\r\nShe started as a university lecturer\r\nthen became a researcher\r\nand then a programme manager.\r\nHer husband, f:rederick Kironde\r\nLule, now works with the government\r\not Uganda. \"He's\r\nparticipated fully in my carccr\r\ndevelopment. Although he is\r\nbased in Kampala while I am in\r\nNairobi, he fully bchcvcs in my\r\nwork. Knowing that my husband\r\nis fully behind mc and making a\r\ndifference in the lives of African\r\nyouth give me satisfaction and\r\nthe drive to work even hardcr,\ufffd\r\nsays the daughter-in-law of che\r\nlate Ugandan President, Prof\r\nYusuf Lule.\r\nMrs Lule, mother to two\r\nchildren-Nagawa (20) and Wan-\r\nyana (18)- says there\r\nis more to be done to\r\nsave the next genera\r\ntion. With almost half\r\nof Africa entering ado\r\nlescence, Pathfinder\r\nsupports programmes\r\nto meet their reproduc\r\ntive health. Adoles\r\ncence is a time for\r\nchoices over who the\r\nyoung people should be, and\r\nwhat to do, where and with\r\nwhom. It is a time of testing lim\r\nits while learning values and\r\nrestraint.\ufffd\r\nMrs Lule says the passage\r\nfrom childhood to adulthood for\r\nadolescents in sub-Saharm Africa\r\nis complicated and fraught with\r\ndangers like sexual exploitation,\r\nsubstance abus\ufffd, violence, pover\r\nty, and crime. What is worse, no\r\nsource of reproductive health\r\ninformation and counselling are\r\navailabic duc to restrictive poli\r\ncies and cultural harriers.\r\n\ufffdPathfinder believes young\r\npeople need allies and an envi\r\nronment that allows them to real\r\nise their full human potential. We\r\nrecognise that in a young per\r\nsons universe, reproductive\r\nhealth is not isolated from other\r\nissues1\ufffd she says.\r\nThat Africa is the most youth\r\nful continent has serious implica\r\ntions for her devel\ufffdpment. It is\r\nfor this reason that Pathfinder\r\nInternational is laying focus on\r\nthem.\r\nSub-Saharan Africa has\r\nthe\r\nworld\ufffd s highest rate of\r\nearly child bearing and the\r\nlowest. More than 50 per cent of the women\r\ngive birth before the age of 18.\r\nAfrica has more than 60 per cent\r\nof the world\ufffds HIV-infected per\r\nsons. Of these, more than 50 per\r\ncent are 15-24-year-olds. Yet.\r\nbecause of culture, policy and\r\nother barriers, these people are\r\nthe least likely to have access to\r\nreproductive health information\r\nand services.\r\nTo help them, says Lule, Path\r\nfinder has developed programmes\r\nin Botswana, Liberia, Swaziland,\r\nKenya, Uganda, Tanzania,\r\nNigeria and Ethiopia. \ufffdWe tackle\r\nissues touching on married and\r\nsingle, in school and out of\r\nschool, and sexually active and\r\ninactive youth,\" she says.\r\n\"These programmes have been\r\ndesigned and implemented in\r\ncollaboration with governments,\r\nfamily planning associations,\r\npublic health institutions,\r\nlearning institutions, and\r\nreligious and community\r\n~roups.\" They also reach pol-\r\nICY makers, parents, educators,\r\nand community leaders with a\r\nview to enabling them to\r\nbecome collaborators in their\r\neffort to assist the youth on\r\ntheir sexuality. They are doing\r\nthis through film, she says.\r\nTheir fist movie, Consequences,\r\na 55-min 16-mm film\r\nhas been watched by 20 million\r\npeople across the continent.\r\nIt is in seven African languages\r\nand appeals to youth\r\nand parents alike.\r\nTo update Consequences,\r\nPathfinder has now created\r\nYellow Card, a 90-minute\r\n35-mm film. '\r\n\"Yellow Card tackles male\r\nresponsibility in family planning,\r\nlife planning skills, prevention\r\nof STD/HIV /AIDS,\r\nsexual abuse and exploitation,\r\nand coercion and violence\r\nagainst women,\" says Mrs\r\nLule.\r\nMrs Lule says film promotes ,\r\nopen communication between\r\nparents and their' children and\r\nthat the vanishing extended\r\nfamily structure is complicating\r\nmatters."}
