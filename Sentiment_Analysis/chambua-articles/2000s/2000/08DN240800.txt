  Q     uestion:   Professor    Bailey,
         could you explain this sudden
  regard to HIV/Aids?
   Answer: More than 35 studies have
   shown that uncircumcised men are two
   to eight times more prone to HIV
   infection. Most of these studies have
  been done in Africa - in fact, East
,Africa. The worst affected areas are
  where men traditionally do not circum-
  cise. The highest HIV prevalence areas
  are, for example, in Uganda, western
  Kenya, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi,
  Botswana, Namibia, Swaziland and
  Kwazulu-Narol region in South Africa.
  In all these, men are traditionally not
  circumcised ..
      Studies have also been done on men
 who are circumcised and those who are
  not, and the two groups observed for
  about two years. It's been found that
  those who are not circumcised have a
 threefold risk of HIV infection than
 those who are circumcised. These stud-
 ies have led some people to caB for
 interventions, saying we should inte-
 grate male circumcision into existing
 HIV prevention programmes. The lim-
 ited programmes we have currently
 include promoting condom use, sex
 abstinence,      encouraging     fidelity
 amongst couples, and improving treat-
 ment of sexually transmitted infections,
 since it has been proved that these            "Facts bear it out", says Professor      Bailey, above, "but we don't need costly initiation         rituals",   such as the ones at ri~:ht and below. (Picture by Baraka Karama)
 increase the risk of HIV infection.
 Q: What evidence is there that circum-          Storm brews in Nyanza
 cision does, indeed, create a difference
 in HIV prevalence?
 A: Studies have shown that the foreskin
 has a very high density of specialized
cells which ten.d to have receptors that
 attract HIV. This is worsened by the fact       over male 'cut'Â· and Aids
that the foreskin is susceptible        to
scratches and tears during intercourse,
h~nce providing easy entry-points for the
VIruS.

areas where men are not circumcised, up                                                                                                                                                      prevalence rate has remained relatively
