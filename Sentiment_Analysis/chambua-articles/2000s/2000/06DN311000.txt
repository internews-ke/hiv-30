Zanzibar poll crisis
should be resolved
 It appears that Tanzania may not have learnt anything from
 the five years of acrimony and instability on its twin islands
 of Zanzibar and Pemba after the opposition rejected Presi-
 dent Salmin Amour's electoral victory.
    The street battles and court tussles that eventually led to
donor suspension of aid seem to have taught little if what is
going on in the general election on the isles is anything to go
by. Already, the Electoral Commission has nullified results
in 16 of Zanzibar's 50 constituencies.
    The election is already tainted. Whoever wins will have to
fight against allegations of vote-rigging and irregularities.
    Granted, voting on the mainland this time round was gen-
erally peaceful. But this is probably because the ruling party,
 Chama Cha Mapinduzi, knew that its candidate, President
Benjamin Mkapa was assured of victory on the mainland.
The same could not be said of Zanzibar, where critics of the
island's Electoral Commission say the ruling party was see-
ing defeat, hence the chaos.
    Zanzibar's Civic United Front, which claimed to have
won the 1995 poll, finds itself caught in a similar situation
this year.
    The opposition candidate, Mr Seif Sharif Hamad, who                                                                     Succession debate: Who next?
claims to have won the 1995 poll, was pitted against the
CCM candidate, Mr Amani Abeid Karume. This time round,               NEWS ANALYSIS
Zanzibar's President Amour, who won by a mere one per
cent in 1995, was not on the ballot - having served two
terms and perhaps not directly interested in ensuring a flaw-

    Some polling stations, however, opened five hours late,
and closed promptly at 5 pm.

there were fears that the tension on the island would not
allow for a peaceful election. The opposition in Zanzibar is
thirsty for victory, a fact that could have caused the tension
on the island on the days preceding the poll.
