Most of these studies have\r\n  been done in Africa - in fact, East\r\n,Africa. The worst affected areas are\r\n  where men traditionally do not circum-\r\n  cise. The highest HIV prevalence areas\r\n  are, for example, in Uganda, western\r\n  Kenya, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi,\r\n  Botswana, Namibia, Swaziland and\r\n  Kwazulu-Narol region in South Africa.\r\n  In all these, men are traditionally not\r\n  circumcised ..\r\n      Studies have also been done on men\r\n who are circumcised and those who are\r\n  not, and the two groups observed for\r\n  about two years. It's been found that\r\n  those who are not circumcised have a\r\n threefold risk of HIV infection than\r\n those who are circumcised. These stud-\r\n ies have led some people to caB for\r\n interventions, saying we should inte-\r\n grate male circumcision into existing\r\n HIV prevention programmes. The lim-\r\n ited programmes we have currently\r\n include promoting condom use, sex\r\n abstinence,      encouraging     fidelity\r\n amongst couples, and improving treat-\r\n ment of sexually transmitted infections,\r\n since it has been proved that these            \"Facts bear it out\", says Professor      Bailey, above, \"but we don't need costly initiation         rituals\",   such as the ones at ri~:ht and below.

This is worsened by the fact       over male 'cut'\u00b7 and Aids\r\nthat the foreskin is susceptible        to\r\nscratches and tears during intercourse,\r\nh~nce providing easy entry-points for the\r\nVIruS.\r\n    Based on the evidence we have, in\r\nareas where men are not circumcised, up                                                                                                                                                      prevalence rate has remained relatively\r\nto S5 per cent of HIV infections are                                                                           Circumcision is lasl emerging as an imponanl yel                              low, at 3-6 per cent.\r\nattributable to this.
