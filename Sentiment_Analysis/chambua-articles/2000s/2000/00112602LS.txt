Catherine has\r\nalways worked and lived in Paris, vacation-\r\ning to stay with her husband during limited\r\nperiods, but she will soon be coming to do\r\nher work in Kenya \"so the benefits of my\r\nresearch may help many people who are\r\ndirectly affected by the HIV scourge in East\r\nAfrica.\"\r\nShe came to visit Pierre after he had been\r\nsent for his tour of duty in Nairobi but stayed\r\nfor only two weeks before going back to\r\n. Paris.\r\nFor Pierre, as for his wife and children, the\r\nthrill of riding a horse casts an irresistible\r\n'spell on his mind and he's creative on the\r\nhorseback. Very much the way the image of\r\nAfrica binds his heart and mind.\r\n\"I'm particularly fond of dressage. It's like\r\ndancing with the horse. You try to make\r\nwhat you want with the horse. It's very\r\ninspiring and interesting,\" says the ambassa-\r\ndor pacing up and down the luxurious lawns\r\non his compound, with his wife by his side\r\nand their ll-year-old dog, Baobab, from\r\nOuagadougou, Burkina Faso, playing around\r\nthe couple.\r\nPierre goes to the races every time an\r\nopportunity presents itself\r\n\"I'm a horse rider - don't try in some\r\nmatter to put the cart a long way before the\r\nhorse. Let us raise our glasses to the Franco-\r\nKenyan friendship,\" Pierre said during a\r\nPress reception held at the French Cultural\r\nCentre in Nairobi on October 25.\r\nCatherine, too, is a keen rider. But for\r\nEleanore it's not just a hobby. It's serious\r\nsport, and she takes part in the French\r\no-     national championships.\r\nMuch as he loves horse-riding, the ambas-\r\nsador puts diplomacy first, Kenya first,\r\nAfrica first.\r\nHe has worked in Africa since 1970-71,\r\nduring which period he was the deputy direc-\r\ntor of studies at the National School of\r\nAdministration in Dakar.\r\n\r\nFrom 1972 to 1974, Pierre was a professor"}
