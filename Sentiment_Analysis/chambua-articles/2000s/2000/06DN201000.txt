     KA mishaps: Give
     us an explanation
      The incident in which a Uganda-bound Kenya Airways flight
      aborted due to a tyre burst is most alarming - especially in
      view of the fact that this was the third tyre burst in as many
    , weeks.
         Such dramatic events can serve only to erode passenger con-
      fidence in the airline's capacity to deliver them safe and sound
     to their destinations. There is no knowing what impact such
     fears will have on the prospects of the airline and Nairobi as a
     destination.
         Though without casualties - thank God! - such incidents
     are bound to dent the image that Kenya Airways has worked so
     hard to cultivate in the recent past. Indeed, from a loss-making
     institution, the airline has lately began to post meaningful pr,of-
     its, chiefly because of sustained efforts to rebuild traveller con-
     fidence in the company.
         All this work is likely to be rolled back not for any fault by
     the carrier but because of what appears to be bad maintenance
     at Nairobi's Jomo Kenyatta International Airport.
         According to reports from the scene of the latest incident -
     on Wednesday - the tyres were suspected to have been shred-                  •.•..   ,.--..".....,.- .. '
