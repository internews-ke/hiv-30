Talk of Succession
obscures real issues
 Recent calIs for an extension of President Moi's tenn of
 office have left many Kenyans baffled as to whether the
 people making them are serious or just floating trial
 balIoons.
    In the first place, the Constitution is clear on the issue.
 Most of the leaders who are loudest on this were in Parlia-
 ment when the Constitution was amended and limitations to
 the presidential tenn of office set at no more than 10 years.
 Why did they not raise their voices then? Why are they now
.calling for the President to continue in power after 2002?
 That would clearly be against the Constitution - and they
 know it.
    At the weekend, two Kanu MPs, Mr Musa Sinna and Mr
 Eric Morogo, added their voices to the cacophony, reason-                                             ••   0
 ing that there is no way the President can leave this country
 disunited. They did not elaborate. What is the correlation
'between national unity, the end of a presidential tenn of
 oftice and explicit constitutional limits on that incumbency?
    These MPs and others are entitled to their views, but
.some of their pronouncements amount to nothing more than
 provocative hot air ..
     First, it is far from clear that Kenyans are agreed about a
 referendum deciding the presidential tenn. The ruling party
 has on more than one occasion said as much whenever the             SPECIAL REPORT

  i$sues.

    There are many reasons why a country can be disunited,
 the principal one being the quality of its leadership. If the
 present leaders have not been able to unite the nation, as the
 MPs implicitly acknowledge, how are they expected to do
 so after the year 2002? If presidential incumbency depends          employers should do
 on factors of disunity for its perpetuation, where IS the pre-
 mium, for an incumbent, in alIowing unity to thrive If it
 signals the end of power?
