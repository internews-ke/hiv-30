 Anti-Aids lobby
 targets patents
 on vital drugs
              ids activists and public health
              enable Kenyans to prodtJce or access
 A            experts feel that the government
              should re-work its patent laws to
  cheap, generic Aids drugs to check the spread
  of the scourge.,                         .
     The statistics are mina-boggling. At least 2.2
  million Kenyans - 14 per cent of the popula-
  tion - are HIV -positive, while 600 others die
  daily. The financial cost is immense and it
  keeps rising. The government plans to spend
  Shl4 billion to combat Aids - a paltry sum
  against such a big national threat.
     Equally sobering are the speeches by victims
  and government officials who are only waking
. up to the reality of Aids. Despite the "wake-
  up" reaction and the willingness by the govern-
  ment to spend, the feeling that the authorities
  are not doing enough is gaining momentum.
     Non-governmental organisations are ques-
  tioning why Kenya, recently. listed as fifth
  among the nations hardest hit by Aids, has
  stuck to patent laws that other Third World,
  including Bangladesh, -:[hailand and South
  Africa, have modified their policies to accom-
  modate their citizens' needs.
     Aids activists, health experts and NGOs say
  that in the long run, it will be cheaper for the
  government to manufacture generic drugs than
  spend billions of borrowed money on aware-
  ness campaigns on citizens still dogged by cul-
  tural beliefs and attitudes.                                                                                                                                                                           Above: Aids patients entertain visitors during an official f1
