  A giant white cross stands tall at the
  National Catholic Marian Shrine on the
 rocky slopes ofSubukia Hills in Nakuru
  District as if guarding the remaining'
  forested portion from the charcoal
 burner's axe.
    This was once a wooded water
 catchment area but the communities
 living in the neighbourhood of the Shrine
 felled almost every tree which could
 yield a few kilogrammes of charcoal and
 twigs for fuelwood.
    This exposed the area to massive soil
 erosion and subsequent degradation. The
 once densely wooded hillsides was left
 bare.
    But there is a ray of hope, thanks to an
 ambitious community based afforestation
 project initiated by an Irish Priest, Father
 John Jones, and backed by government
 extension staff which aims at
 rehabilitating 370 squares of the critical
 Subukia water catchment area.
    At the height of the severe drought
 which hit Subukia and other parts ofthe
 country last year, a peasant farmer who
 had invested all his savings in a tomato
 crop, took a rope and hanged himself
 after the streams flowing from the hills
 dried up, ruining the farmer's entire
 crop.
    Among the seasonal rivers which rise
 from the Subukia water catchment area
 are Gitundaga, Mumoi, Subukia,
 Igwamiti, Kianoe, Kinoru and the Ward
 Springs.
    Several farmers in the Subukia Valley
 said they all agree with the extension
 officers that only the afforestation of the
 catchment will sustain the production of
 vegetables, particularly during the dry
 season.
    Father John Jones who is in charge of
 the Marian Shrine has established a big
 tree seedlings nursery with the assistance                           Subukia Hill and Valley: Extensive forest destruction    has caused massive soil erosion on the previously hil~hly productive land.
