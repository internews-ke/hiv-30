 In January 1997 the chairman of the Kwale County Council gave his consent in writing for prospecting within
 the area of Kwale District. In April 1997 the Mining and Geology Department issued a special licence to allow                       cattle rustlers

 In early '1998, the District Development Committee (DOC) found it necessary to institute a District
 Environmental Committee to study the project's activitigs. The sub-committee made recommendations that
 were addressed in the EIA process. Following this, the Terms of Reference were drafted by CES and
 presented to the DOC for approval.                                                                                                                                                                                              The Marakwet      Kanu and Ford-
