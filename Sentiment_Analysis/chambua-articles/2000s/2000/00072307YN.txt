Those aged between 9-10 will be exposed to\r\n personal computers (PC), and how best to utilise them. The13-14-year-olds will\r\n learn video techniques like panning, zooming and much more.\r\n       The course is divided into six age-appropriate modules.\r\n       The programme hopes to attract school-going children who wish to have fun\r\n while learning. Through animation, they will be able to make their own alphabet\r\n choice.\r\n       Suresh Kumar, the head of the programme, says the type of learning that\r\n will be offered will also make children kind to animals and the environment. The\r\n curriculllm has characters designed to promote responsibility.\r\n      The programme schedules include summer (holiday) camps in which\r\n children will attend classes for two hours in 15 days.\r\n      It also includes an annual one-hour a week session.\r\n        Kavia Panna ,S, a pupil at Peponi Primary School, told the 'Young Nation'\r\n that the centre has a good atmosphere for children to become computer literate\r\n at primary school level.\r\n      The 'self-learning' approach is expected to help the children realise their\r\n computer dreams.\r\n                                                                                                                                      -\r\n                                                                                                                                      \"-\r\n                                                                                       The above illustration is the winning piece this week.
