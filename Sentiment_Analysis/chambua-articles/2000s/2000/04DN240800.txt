Mr Basil Earle Wainwright, who
claims to have a cure for HIV/
Aids, wants the government
ordered lo allow hwnan trials of
tie proçedure.
[n a suit against the Permanent
Secretary in the Ministry of
Health. Mr Wainwright, popu
lady known as Dr Stone, wants
the PS, Prof Julius Meme,
ordered to allow human thais of
the treatment procedure known as
Polyatomic Aspheresis
Dr Stone, who filed the suit
through a Nairobi lawyer, Mi’
Paul Mwangi, claims to have
invented the controversial
treatment system.
Dr Stone is also applyin for an
order to prohibit the Mimstry of
Health from interfering with his
research effort.
He says that his application
was prompted by the fact that
HlViAids infection rate in Kenya
stood at 700 persons a day while
the death rate is 500 people per
day.
He says the actions of the min.
istry were biased, discriminatory
and unreasonable. They were
influenced by extraneous matters
and failure to consider relevant
issues, he adds.
The PS’s action in refusing
him to carry out research was an
abuse of office, he argues.
He further avers that his com
pany, Polyatomic Aspheresis
Research Limited, had been
engaged in the research on the use
of polyatomic oxygen in the treat
ment of chronic diseases since
1996.
A physicist by profession, Dr
Stone says he has been engaged in
the development of new technolo
gies and inventions.
He says he has been involved in
the global search for the appropri
ate use of oxygen in (he treatment
of chronic diseases in human
beings
