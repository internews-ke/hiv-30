{"text": "Sunday Nation, December 31, 2000\r\n\r\nYEAR TO END FIRST\r\n\r\ndiplomatic nature of the tragedy.\r\nWhen Information, Transport and Communications\r\nMinister Musalia Mudavadi faced CNN\r\ncameras to tell the world about the accident, his\r\nwas the face of a man who understood that when\r\nyour national flag carrier crashes, you owe the\r\nworld at least the information, if not an\r\nexplanation.\r\nThis rapid response reflex was also seen when\r\na Kenya Railways train exploded into flames\r\ncausing death and injuries in Athi River.\r\nAmong the first at the scene for the rescue was\r\nMr Titus Naikuni, the Transport and Communications\r\nPermanent Secretary. Also there promptly\r\nwere Police Commissioner Philemon Abong'o,\r\nthe KR Managing Director Douglas Odette and a\r\ndirector of operations at police headquarters, Mr\r\nJohn Onono .\r\nFirefighters from the Kenya Army, Kenya Air\r\nForce and City Council came to the scene.\r\nKenyans seem to have learnt a lot from the\r\nterrorist bomb that struck Nairobi in August,\r\n1998. Authorities seem to be getting the cue that\r\nthey owe Kenyans an .explanation and some apo]-\r\nogy when crises strike.\r\nThat was not always the case in the past. When\r\nthe 1998 bomb went off, the government reacted\r\nby dispatching the Genera] Service Unit and\r\nPolice to the scene. No one thought that counse]-\r\nlors and information would be needed. Traditionally,\r\ngovernment officials would maintain a tight\r\nsilence, with an explanation that only the minister\r\ncould talk.\r\nThat minister or manager would conveniently\r\nbe \"out\" even when in. The authorities saw the\r\nUS take care of its citizens at the bombed embassy.\r\nKenyans read discrimination. The fact is, US\r\nembassy officials understood that a government's\r\nfirst duty is to its citizens. Kenyans have learnt.\r\nDeath came closer home when Ebola struck in\r\nUganda as the year neared its end. There was fear\r\nthat the malady may cross over to Kenya. The\r\nMinistry of Health was seen to be concerned and.\r\ndid screen people at the border.\r\nThe danger may not be over yet. But there is a\r\nfeeling that the government tried. The climax was\r\nthe expulsion of 137 Ugandans who had been\r\nbooked in at the Nairobi Safari Club, where they\r\nwere' holding a politica] conference. The government\r\nfeared they could have been carriers of the\r\ndisease.\r\nSome people described the eviction as callous.\r\nAfter all, Ugandans are our neighbours. However,\r\nHealth Minister Amukowa Anangwe was\r\nright. The government's first duty is to its\r\ncitizens. That learning has tied well with the emergence\r\nof parliamentary committees seen\r\nto be acting directly on behalf of the\r\ncitizens.\r\nWhen Kenyan soldiers were hemmed\r\nin in Sierra Leone, the parliamentary Defence\r\nCommittee marched to the West African country\r\nto get first-hand information. In Parliament,\r\nnumerous MPs wanted a statement on the safety\r\nof Kenyans in Sierra Leone.\r\nSome people questioned the logic behind send- -\r\ning MPs to the battleground at the expense of\r\ntaxpayers. But it is what other countries do. Congressional\r\ncommittees are so powerful in the US\r\n.that they can stop what a President would allow if\r\nthey consider it inappropriate. Last year, Senator\r\nJesse He]ms told the UN that the US might pull\r\nout of the international body if members kept\r\npressing the country to pay its debt.\r\nSen Helms was speaking as the chairman of\r\nthe Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. Earlier\r\nlast year, he stopped USAid from giving\r\nmoney to West African countries that wanted to\r\ncontrol flow of small firearms even though President\r\nClinton had approved the assistance.\r\nParliamentary committees, where they work,\r\npoint to a healthier watchdog role by Parliament.\r\nIt is something that emerged strongly this year.\r\nKenyans have reason to hope that it continues.\r\nKenyan authorities did away with red tape\r\nafter the plane crash. They were annoyed when\r\nthey met that bureaucracy in Abidjan. We can\r\ntake pride in the knowledge that the tragedies\r\nhave pushed us into responding to emergencies in\r\nthe internationally acceptable manner.\r\nThere were fears that Kenya might descend\r\ninto Zimbabwe-style land takeover chaos when\r\nthe year began. Western media predicted that and\r\nloca] politicians urged Kenyans to do it. It failed,\r\nan indication that Kenyans understand that they\r\nhave a unique position in Africa and do not bow\r\nto every whim.\r\n\"Peace is a central variable in predicting the\r\nfuture. We may see it as political rhetoric but it is\r\na requirement that Kenyans should not take for\r\ngranted,\" said Mr Po]ycarp Ochilo, a lecturer at\r\nthe University of Nairobi and a regular traveller\r\nto foreign destinations.\r\nSailing through the chaos in Zimbabwe and\r\nother neighbouring countries marked another\r\nKenyans' commitment to remaining within the\r\npaths of the rule of law.\r\n\"We have lots of prob]ems,\" Mr Ochilo says,\r\n\"but we are not the worst of the African lot. He\r\npointed out that even with damaged infrastructure\r\nand lowest economic performance, Kenyans have\r\nnever missed their salaries, even this dying year\r\nwhich is regarded as one of the hardest Kenyans\r\nhave faced.\"\r\n\"Of course we can do better. But the trials of\r\nthis year have shoWn a unique resilience of Kenyans.\r\nWe have reason to hope for the best.\"\r\nMr Ochi]o, the President of the African Counci]\r\nfor Communication Education, mentions the\r\nexpansion of the media as a great achievement\r\nthis year. He says it is an indication that there\r\ncould be an expansion of the democratic space\r\nthat comes with a libera]ised media market. .\r\n\"Libera] media is necessary in a democracy.\r\nThe Iiberalisation of airwaves is, therefore, an\r\nachievement journalists cannot ignore.\"\r\n\"In our low and beaten moods, we often fail to\r\nrecognise what we should congratulate ourselves\r\nfor,\" Mr Ochi]o said.\r\nThis year, a Kenyan doctor, Mr Fabian Mwanyumba,\r\nwas _among the -only three scientists\r\nawarded the Young Investigators Award at the\r\n]3th World Aids Conference.\r\nDr Mwanyumba was recognised for his studies\r\non mother-to-child transmission of HIV.\r\nHis studies sought to identify the exact stage at\r\nwhich most HIV -positive mothers infect their\r\nbabies. And to think that the research was done at\r\nthe Coast General Hospital, - one of the many\r\nmuch-maligned health institutions in Kenya,\r\ncould be another indication that we need to\r\nappreciate what we have.\r\nDr Mwanyumba's achievement did not get\r\nmuch publicity at home. He was no politician.\r\nBut it is another indication that despite the very\r\nhard times the nation is going through, other\r\nnations, more so our neighbours, have a lot of\r\ncatching up to do.\r\nThe World Bank and the Internationa] Monetary\r\nFund aid may not be everything. But the fact\r\nthat the donors renewed their engagement with\r\nKenya after nine years is a triumph to count in\r\n2000. The resumption is a reminder that at times,\r\nwe suffer needlessly. The government always\r\nknew what was to be done. And there were\r\nalways people who could do it. But we chose not\r\nto do so and suffered for it.\r\nSave for President Moi's promised surprises,\r\nthe big events of 2000 are over."}
