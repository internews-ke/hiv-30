{"text": "\ufeffDAILY NATION, TUESDAY, JUNE 13,2000\r\n\r\nFORGET THE ECONOMICS\r\nPOVERTY HAS RISEN BY 10 PC IN FIVE YEARS\r\n\r\n\"Trickle-down\" economics is not\r\nworking! With per capita income\r\nat roughly the same level as it\r\nwas in 1988 (and these were' the\r\nheady days of 4-5 per cent\r\ngrowth), and an increasing\r\nnumber of Kenyans living on\r\nless than a dollar and eating less\r\nthan 2,250 calories every day,\r\npoverty is the one economic indicator\r\nthat has gone up over the\r\npast year.\r\nFrom around 40 per cent in\r\n1994; the national poverty level\r\nhas risen steeply to 50 per cent\r\nin 1999 - effectively an increase\r\nof 10 percentage points in\r\nfive years! Simply put, at this\r\nrate of economic deterioration,\r\n90 per cent of Kenyans will be\r\nwallowing in poverty at the time'\r\nwe expected to join the NIC\r\nranks in 2020! Clearly this is\r\nunacceptable, and a radical rethink\r\nin national strategy is necessary\r\nto pull Kenya out of the\r\nmorass.\r\nYet, paradoxically, Kenya has\r\nperformed well in meeting its\r\nother macro-economic targets.\r\nFor most of the past decade, the\r\ngovemment has emphasised the\r\nimportance of maintaining single\r\ndigit inflation rates, low interest\r\nrates and stable foreign exchange\r\nrates.\r\nThese were the three pillars of\r\nthe government's strategy for\r\neconomic growth. In isolation,\r\nthe targets for these three pillars\r\nhave been met, but benefits are\r\nnot trickling down, and the public,\r\n-producers and consumers are\r\nfar from celebrating.\r\n, Inflation is a real success story.\r\nWe have not forgotten the\r\nhigh inflation rates of 1993,\r\nwhich made living almost unbearable\r\nfor many people. The\r\ngovernment committed to maintaining\r\nsingle digit inflation and\r\nthis has certainly been the case\r\nfor the last two years. In 1999,\r\nwe recorded the lowest official\r\nrate of 3.5 per cent yet.\r\n, Slow. growth in agriculture\r\nover the past two years (1.5 per\r\ncent in 1998 and 1.2 per cent in\r\n1999), as well as continued increases\r\nin petroleum prices and\r\nthe delayed effects of the shilling's\r\ndepreciation continue to\r\nexert pressure on consumer prices.\r\nIndeed, these inflationary\r\npressures are likely to persist,\r\ngiven the famine and drought situation\r\nprevalent in many parts of\r\nthe country.\r\nThe slowdown in money supply\r\ngrowth is a moderating factor\r\nin inflation management, and\r\nthis is reflected in falling rates of\r\nunderlying inflation during the\r\nyear. In this regard, at least it is\r\ncommendable that we are living\r\nwithin our budget and avoiding\r\nborrowing heavily from expen-\r\n'sive local sources.\r\nHowever, the slowdown in\r\nspending h'as negative repercussions.\r\nInfrastructure remains\r\nlargely neglected and most sectors\r\nof the economy are in glaringly\r\nbad shape.\r\nRecent increased spending on\r\nroad repairs, particularly in urban\r\nareas, will increase money\r\nsupply. Kenya's development\r\npartners are not yet ready to release\r\nsubstantial amounts of\r\nmoney for public works. And the\r\nfunds under fuel levy, unless ac-\u00b7\r\ncumulated over the years, may\r\nnot be sufficient to for the required\r\ninvestment. This suggests\r\nthat funding other than the EI\r\nNino rehabilitation programme\r\nwill be obtained from expensive\r\nlocal borrowing.\r\nBorrowers are not taking the\r\nbait of lower interest rates ..\r\nBuilding on the argument, and\r\nthe observation that high interest\r\nrates were slowing down the\r\neconomy, it.was assumed that if\r\nthe government reduced its borrowing\r\nfrom the private sector\r\nthose funds would be available\r\nto local investors at lower and\r\nmore attractive rates. (See table\r\nelsewhere) Interest rates on the\r\n91-days Treasury bill, and in reality\r\nfor all other facilities,\r\nreached their lowest level in\r\nthree years at the beginning of\r\n1999. They rallied with the\r\nTreasury bill rate, increasing by\r\nabout 10 percentage points by\r\nthe end of the year. Interest on\r\ncommercial bank deposits followed\r\nthe same pattern. As is\r\nusual at this time of the year,\r\nT-bill rates have fallen dramatically\r\nagain (to around II per\r\ncent), but borrowers still refuse\r\nto bite!\r\nThe low interest rate experience\r\nof 1999 did nothing to build\r\ndemand for credit. As the table\r\nshows, overdraft rates remain\r\n\"upwardly mobile but downwardly\r\nsticky\", while business is\r\nlooking for a stable interest rate\r\naround the 20 per cent level. The\r\ngeneral slowing of the economy\r\nhas also created little incentive\r\nto borrow. Indeed, _the government\r\nmay be the only beneficiary\r\nas it was able to settle its Treasury\r\nbill obligations at a lower\r\nrate for the year.\r\n1999 was an interesting year\r\nfor the financial sector. Two\r\ncommercial banks were resuscitated,\r\nand the Central Bank\r\nshows every sign of maintaining\r\nand improving further the discipline\r\nof the sector. These are\r\nwelcome and confidencebuilding\r\nsigns given the erosion\r\nof public faith of the recent past,\r\nwhich followed the collapse of\r\nsome banks and disclosures on\r\nnon-performing loans.\r\nThe future for commercial\r\nbanks in Kenya is of interest.\r\nThey see limited retums from\r\nsmaller customers, and their traditional\r\nagricultural businesses,\r\nand continue to focus on risk--\r\nfree T-bill investments. Alternative\r\nservice providers for these\r\nless profitable groups are not\r\nemerging quickly enough. At the\r\nclose of 1999, average liquidity\r\n'of commercial banks exceeded\r\nby a factor of two the minimum\r\nliquidity requirement.\r\nThe falland fall of the shilling:\r\nEven though the shilling has\r\nbeen losing ground against the\r\nmajor trading currencies in the\r\nworld for a long time now, critics\r\nmaintain that it is overvalued.\r\nTheir main argument is that Kenya\r\ngenerates insufficient foreign\r\nexchange through either trade or\r\nservices to maintain such a\r\nstrong shilling.\r\nSupport by government intervention\r\nis a thing of the past, and\r\nmany feared the flight of \"hot\r\nmoney\" chasing the most attractive\r\nT-bill rates. The table elsewhere\r\nindicates that these fears\r\nwere unjustified. There was little\r\ndepreciation of the shilling with\r\nthe lowering of interest on Treasury\r\nbills.\r\nOne can easily conclude that\r\nthere is no direct relationship between\r\nTreasury bill rate and the\r\nexchange rate based on the table.\r\nMarkets do react sentimentally.\r\nThey reflect hopes and possibilities\r\nof realising large credits in\r\nthe immediate future from IMF\r\nand World Bank. These are mirrored\r\nin the appreci~tion of the\r\nshilling between September and\r\nDecember 1999 with the negotiations\r\nfor resumption of fin!lncial\r\naid, as are the effects ofrecent\r\nclaims about land grabbing.\r\nKenyans, fewer than we\r\nthought. good news or bad? Historically,\r\nKenya's high population\r\ngrowth rate is regarded as a\r\nkey factor in the decline of available\r\nservices and per capita income.\r\nPopulation grew at an average\r\nof 3.4 per cent per year\r\nbetween 1979 and 1989, and was\r\na matter of national and international\r\nconcern. Rates have fallen\r\nsince, to 2.9 per cent between\r\n1989 and 1999, and to 2.4 in\r\n1999. Future growth is projected\r\nat.2.0 per cent.\r\nAs a result, and contrary to\r\npopular expectation, the recent\r\nCensus provides a result of 28.7\r\nmillion, far lower than the ,30\r\nmillion population estimated as\r\nrecently as the end of 1998.\r\nAlthough the population\r\ngrowth rate has slackened, the\r\ncountry's education system continues\r\nto chum out valuable potential\r\nresources into a labour\r\nmarket with very limited employment\r\nopportunities~\r\nEconomic slowdown means jobs\r\nparticularly in formal employment\r\nstagnate: '\r\nTotal employment grew by\r\n7.7 per cent between 1998 and\r\n1999, against annual increase in\r\nlabour supply of 500,000 people\r\neach year (10 per cent of total\r\nemployment). The informal s~ctor\r\ncontinues to be the largest\r\nemployer in Kenya. However,\r\nthere is much underemployment\r\nin this sector, and value-added\r\nremains low. This sector is the\r\nfastest growing sector in the\r\neconomy, and is a key driver for\r\npoverty alleviation. [t requires\r\nspecific focus and support particularly\r\nof quality control, prodUct\r\nmarketing and credit.\r\nThe HIV/Aids scourge in\r\nKenya is real and impacts heavily\r\non bot~ mortality rates and labour\r\noutput. At the end of 1999,\r\nit was estimated that more than\r\n2.2 million Kenyans were living\r\nwith HIV, and that we lose more\r\nthan 500 people dai ly to\r\n\r\nCONTINUED PAGE 5 COL 1"}
