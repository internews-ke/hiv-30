{"text": "            Nairobi, Monday, October 2, 2000\r\n   A good showing\r\n   for Kenya but ...\r\n    Kenyan athletes did a splendid job in the Sydney Olympics,\r\n    which ended yesterday.        Having won six medals, they were\r\n    ranked only second to Ethiopia among African countries.\r\n       The two gold medallists - Reuben Kosgei and Noah Ngeny\r\n    - lifted the spirits of many Kenyans, especially at this time\r\n    when we all crave something positive to distract us from the\r\n    country~s social and economic problems.\r\n       Equally commendable were silver medal winners Paul Tergat\r\n   Wilson Boit and Eric Wainaina. Also finishing among the top\r\n   three Bernard Lagat and Joyce Chepchumba, who won bronze.\r\n      While the women's volleyball team failed to make an impres-\r\n   sion, they competed in the true Olympics spirit of honour. We\r\n   say congratulations.\r\n      But could Kenya have done better?, Reputed to be among\r\n   some of the best middle and distance runners in the world, our\r\n  athletes had plenty of oppOrtunities to surpass their performance\r\n  in 1988 Seoul Olympics but bungled up everything.\r\n      The medallists in Sydney did not win by fluke. They all shared\r\n  something in common - right focus, serious preparations and\r\n  the determination to do well in the games.                    '\r\n      Their Ol~pic      dream started four years ago. In Ngeny's own\r\n words, he skipped the money spinning Grand Prix circuit to\r\n concentrate on the Olympics.\r\n     Prior to the games, Tergat ran only four races, including the              COMMENTARY\r\n trials,. while Wainaina last ran in a marathon race in January.\r\n     ThI.S goes to show that success comes through sacrifice and\r\n plan~mg. These medallists are now hot properties for athletic\r\n me~tmg promoters and they will soon recoup all earnings lost                   Snap out of this denial\r\n whIle preparing for the Olympics. For example, it would be a\r\npromoter's dream to have a rematch between Ngeny and Hicham\r\nEl Guerrouj of Morocco or Tergat and Gebreselassie ..\r\n     The Kenya Amateur Athletic Association           (KAAA)      must\r\nprocedure 'should also be beyond reproach.\r\nshare the blame.
