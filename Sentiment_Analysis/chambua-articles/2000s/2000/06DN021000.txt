   A good showing
   for Kenya but ...
    Kenyan athletes did a splendid job in the Sydney Olympics,
    which ended yesterday.        Having won six medals, they were
    ranked only second to Ethiopia among African countries.
       The two gold medallists - Reuben Kosgei and Noah Ngeny
    - lifted the spirits of many Kenyans, especially at this time
    when we all crave something positive to distract us from the
    country~s social and economic problems.
       Equally commendable were silver medal winners Paul Tergat
   Wilson Boit and Eric Wainaina. Also finishing among the top
   three Bernard Lagat and Joyce Chepchumba, who won bronze.
      While the women's volleyball team failed to make an impres-
   sion, they competed in the true Olympics spirit of honour. We
   say congratulations.
      But could Kenya have done better?, Reputed to be among
   some of the best middle and distance runners in the world, our
  athletes had plenty of oppOrtunities to surpass their performance
  in 1988 Seoul Olympics but bungled up everything.
      The medallists in Sydney did not win by fluke. They all shared
  something in common - right focus, serious preparations and
  the determination to do well in the games.                    '
      Their Ol~pic      dream started four years ago. In Ngeny's own
 words, he skipped the money spinning Grand Prix circuit to
 concentrate on the Olympics.
     Prior to the games, Tergat ran only four races, including the              COMMENTARY
 trials,. while Wainaina last ran in a marathon race in January.
     ThI.S goes to show that success comes through sacrifice and
 plan~mg. These medallists are now hot properties for athletic
 me~tmg promoters and they will soon recoup all earnings lost                   Snap out of this denial
 whIle preparing for the Olympics. For example, it would be a
promoter's dream to have a rematch between Ngeny and Hicham
El Guerrouj of Morocco or Tergat and Gebreselassie ..
