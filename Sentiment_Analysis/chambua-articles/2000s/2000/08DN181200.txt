 Our conti~ent must brace for 'benign neglect' from Republicans
           By SALIH BOOKER
               Mr George      W. Bush
              hen asked about Africa
 W             during the second presi-
               dential campaign debate,
  responded:    "There's    got to be
  priorities."
      Africa did not make his short list:
  The Middle East, Europe, the Far East,
  and the Americas was the order of his
  priorities.
      A Bush presidency portends a return
, to the blatantly anti-African policies of
  the Reagan-Bush years, characterised
  by a general disregard for black people
  and a perception of Africa as a social
  welfare case.
      Vice-President      Dick Cheney      is
  widely expected to steer the younger
  Bush on most' policy matters, espe-
  cially foreign affairs. Mr Cheney's
  perspective on Africa in the 1980s was
  epitomised by his 1986 vote in favour        President Clinton: Bush backed his            VP-elect Dick Cheney: Wanted                     President-elect Bush: Africa not in           Secr~tary of State Colin Powell: No
