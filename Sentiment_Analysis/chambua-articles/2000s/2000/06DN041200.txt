 Nassir must not get
 away with this folly
  Cabinet Minister Shariff Nassir's reiteration yesterday that he
  urged rioting youths on an arsonist rampage to hit back at other
  riotous groups is both brazen and deplorable. It is also most
  regrettable, coming from a stalwart of a Cabinet that not only
  puts much store by collective responsibility     but whose head,
  the President, is to be seen most Sundays in church and to be
  often heard calling for religious and communal tolerance and
  co-existence.
     Mr Nassir's two greatest claims to prominence are precisely
  that he is a member of the Cabinet and a political devotee of the
  President's as a ruling party hard-liner. But he serves the inter-
  ests of neither office when he calls press conferences          to
  acknowledge that, yes, he did indeed add fuel to the fire of a
. full-scale riot in Nairobi South B by telling Muslim youths "not
  to turn the other cheek" and to retaliate to the burning of a
  mosque in such a way as to outdo their perceived adversaries in
  the scale of the outrage perpetrated against them.
     And why did Mr Nassir, a Minister of State in the Office of
  the President, engage in such incendiary bad advice bang in the
  middle of a riot? He blithely says: "I told the Muslim youth to
  hit back with greater force if they are provoked because I am a
  leader who is ready to sacrifice myself for my people and I do
  not like cowards."
     This incoherent would-be populism is the most grievous non-
 sense. Mr Nassir is ready to sacrifice absolutely nothing. In           COMMENT ARY
 fact, if every member of the Cabinet behaved the way Mr
 Nassir has done, and bragged about it at press conferences
 afterwards by speaking through both sides of their mouths, this
 country would be aflame from seaside cpast to lakeside coast          A toast to liberated men
 and all points North and South.
     Mr Nassir's conduct is totally unacceptable. No Cabinet min-
 ister anywhere in the world, outside of a fascist regime (and
 so much of his deficiencies as a leader as of the sorry state Of
 there are virtually none of these left), could get away with Mr
 Nassir's actions and utterances of the past weekend. And if Mr        in the fight against Aids
 Nassir does indeed get away with it, this will be a reflection not
governance and rule oflaw and decency in this country.
   What happened at South B last week is to be deeply regretted
                                                                       I've always had the nagging suspicion that                                                           and drug-related risk-taking."
