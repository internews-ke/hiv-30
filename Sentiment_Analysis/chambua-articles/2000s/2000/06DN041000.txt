   Rid City Hall of
   stultlbling blocks
    Nairobi Town Clerk Geoffrey Mate makes a very serious allega-
    tion indeed when he accuses councillors and chief officers of
    sabotage.
       He tol~ jou,?alists on Monday that City Hall's politicians and
    the functIOnanes had hatched a plot to frustrate the council's
    restructuring programme. Without mentioning names, he added
    the officers concerned wanted to cover up their misdeeds.
       Internecine wars at the council are no longer news. Indeed, a
   good number of its sessions have ended up in fisticuffs. But the
   latest claims are unsettling for the simple reason that City Hall is
   in dire need of reorganisation if it is to deliver effective services
   to residents.
       The council has been in the doldrums for longer than most
   Nairobi residents care to remember. City infrastructure, including
   schools and hospitals, are in a deplorable state of disrepair. The
   council has more staff than it knows what to do with. Garbage
   collection was such a nightmare that residents came up with their
   own alternatives. Plot scandals, involving officers and council-
   lors, have been too numerous to count. The litany of ills is long.
      But, even as services have deteriorated, the council's capacity                                                                                                                               I

                                                                                                                                                                                                    2000
      Against this backdrop, Mr Mate's accusations of a conspiracy
  to block reforms takes on very serious connotations. It is in the
  interest of all parties that City Hall is cleaned up.                       COMMENTARY
      Mr Mate needs to be very ruthless if he is to remain on track in
  his efforts to implement the recommendations of the Mbugua
  Report. Too often, the objectives of Govemment probe teams are
  defeated by recalcitrant officials.
      However painful restructuring, it will be worthwhile all round         Parliament should
  if the result is to streamline services at City Hall. That will,
  inevitably, mean job cuts and new operational systems and struc-
  tures.
      In that process, it will be absolutely necessary to redefine the                                                                                                                                        I
