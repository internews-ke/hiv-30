{"text": "DAIL Y\r\nNATION\r\n     Nairobi, Thursday, August 3, 2000\r\nRuling on HIV\r\nwife a landmark\r\nThere can be nothing as callous, as insensitive and as crude\r\nas a self-righteous human being dishing out judgment upon\r\nhis fellows as though he were God.\r\n   Our Constitution forbids discrimination of any kind and,\r\nalthough when it was framed, the Aids scourge was\r\nunknown, discrimination on that ground, whether in the\r\nworkplace or in any social setting, is still patently illegal.\r\n   That, obviously, implies that, on the domestic front, you\r\ncannot discriminate against your spouse on account of his\r\nor her HIV status unless the condition is such that one of\r\nthe spouses endangers all others in the family and, there-\r\nfore, has to be physically removed from contact with the\r\nrest. And the answer to that is hospitalisation, not some\r\nkind of quarantine.\r\n   That is why the ruling by three appellate judges that a\r\nman who drove away his wife from her marital home to\r\nlive in their servant quarters because she had tested HIV\r\npositive is a landmark.\r\n    The judges were overturning an earlier ruling by a High\r\nCourt judge that denied the wife the enjoyment of her\r\nhuman rights and even took away custody of their children.          NEWS ANALYSIS\r\nThe man, who works for an international company, had\r\nsued for divorce after 10 years of marriage, and the judge\r\nhad agreed with him that the wife posed a grave threat to\r\nhis life.                                                           Did we sell our soul to\r\n    The appeal judges ordered him to take her back, saying it\r\nwas morally wrong and insensitive for the woman, who\r\nwas contributing her share of the monthly mortgage pay-\r\nments, to be denied her rights by being confined to a single\r\nroom with only a simple bed and a cooker.                           get aid from the IMF?\r\n    This judgment should set a precedent for cases of that\r\nnature where abuse of human rights are visited upon hap-\r\n less people who, before Tuesday, had no idea where to turn\u00b7\r\nto.
