All we can do is\r\n  sit back and watch how the development              will impact on the\r\n  money market, in both the long and the short term.\r\n      Will loans become cheaper and more available to Ken-\r\n  yans? Will commercial banks stop auctioning the property of\r\n  defaulters?    Will our heavily-indebted        leaders and business-\r\n  men borrow cheaply to refinance the big loans they owe the\r\n  commercial banks?\r\n    , We need to observe how the Bill's passage will impact em\r\n  the other macro-economic         indicators - the exchange rate,\r\n  inflation and the balance of payments.\r\n      If, for instance, there is capital flight, as has been predict-\u00b7,\r\n  ed, then we must, in the short run, expect a depreciated shil-\r\n  ling. We live in a a global financial village in '!Vhich billions\r\n  of dollars can move from one continent to another at the\r\n  touch of a button .\r\n . The prospect of a depreciated          shilling is especially worri-\r\n   some because, with oil prices already on an upward trend and\r\n   in view of the fact that the oil industry is among the biggest             COMMENTARY\r\n  pl.ayers in our dollar market, ,we may end up with even higher\r\n  petroleum prices.                                          ,\r\n      During the euphoria characterising        the debate on the Bill, it\r\n  was found expedient to bash the World Bank and the Interna-                Why epidemic spre:ads\r\n  tional Monetary Fund. MPs had a field day criticising the\r\n  policy of liberalisation      and looking for scapegoats       for ,our\r\n',economic problems. The mood was captured by the Demo-\r\n  cratic Party Chairman Mwai Kibaki, who declared that the\r\n  Goyernment had \"sold its soul to. foreign theories\" ..                     despite the awareness\r\n      It is one thing to thump the chest and seek scapegoats.
