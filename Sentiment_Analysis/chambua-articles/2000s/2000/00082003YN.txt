{"text": "\ufeffAUGUST 20, 2000\r\nBY MWAKERA MWAJEFA\r\n\r\nBigMama struts across the school compound in a\r\nflashy manner that attracts a young man. Moments\r\nlater, the boy finds himself in an exclusive beach\r\nhotel rubbing shoulders with the rich and mighty.\r\nUnder this \"magical spell\", he finds himself on a divan\r\nbed with Big Mama, who introduces him to a fantasy world\r\nhe had no idea about.\r\nSeconds later, Big Mama extends a thick envelope to\r\nthe sheepish boy in which she has stashed Sh20,000. In it is\r\nalso a small note saying: \"You have become a member of\r\nthe exclusive club. Welcome and use the money to buy\r\nyourself a coffin. Bye....\r\nThis and more is what members of the Tononoka Youth\r\nDevelopment Group (TYDG),had for the Mombasa public\r\nrecently.\r\nTitled \"Big Mama\", the play' eaches youth to refrain\r\nfrom indiscriminate sex because it could lead to death.\r\nWith the Aids/HIV scourge ti Iking its toll, the TYDG\r\nfears that unless youth are educllted about the problem,\r\nthey will all fall prey to it.\r\nStarted early this year, TYDG has 20 members who are\r\nusing open-air theatre to help figllt the life-threatening ills in\r\nsociety.\r\nIdleness and lack of employ~\"ent are leading youth to\r\ndrug abuse, alcoholism, smoking commercial sex and\r\ncrime.\r\nThe group's treasurer, Peter Cchieng, says the youth are\r\nsuccumbing to drugs, alcohol anI I the Aids scourge.\r\n\"Our aim is to keep ourselves busy, now that\r\nemployment opportunities have b ~come rare,\" Peter adds.\r\nThe group is also engaged in clea n-up campaigns.\r\nDuring the August 12 open-ail show at Tononoka\r\ngrounds, TYDG used concerts, pu ns, poems, speeches and\r\nplays to create awareness on dru~'S and Aids.\r\nThrough the poem 'Aids - The:Killer' by Esther Mweni,\r\n19, the public was cautioned to b( careful about their sex\r\nlives while \"Enough is Enough\" by Anna Nyange, 17, talks of\r\ncoming to grips with the reality th\\ ft indiscriminate sex is not\r\nsafe. '\r\nNicholas Wanjogu and Tina R,Iphael, in a Kiswahili\r\npiece 'Ukimwi Kinywa Kipana', sheIW how Aids is deadly,\r\nwhile Tina's solo verse 'Moshi,' warns against indulging in\r\nsmoking.\r\nAnother play, 'Jihadhari na Madawa ya Kulevya,'\r\nemphasises the need to avoid dru~s as they also influence\r\nrowdy behaviour ,\r\nPeter says they need statione,\r\n1\r\n\" costumes and a proper\r\nvenue for their rehearsals in order 0 improve their\r\nperformances,. I\r\nThe group is app~aling for ass; ltance from individuals,\r\nwell-wishers and non-governmenta I organisations to come\r\nto their aid. The group also plans t(\u00b7 perform plays based\r\non secondary schools set books in order to raise funds."}
