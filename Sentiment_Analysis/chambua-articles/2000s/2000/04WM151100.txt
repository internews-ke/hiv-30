NEVER TOO YOUNG FOR A WALK IN THE NIGHT

BY JAMES MIRITI
It'spast midnight and a
group of underage .girls
are gathered outside a
nightclub in Chuka town.
Unmoved by the harsh
weather, the shabbilydressed
girls can be heard' discussing
the night's prospects. The
oldest among them, 14-year-old
Jackline Gatwiri, is trying to
cheer them up. "Things haven't
always been this bad," she
assures them, but is quick to add
that perseverance is a must in
their new trade.
True to her prediction, a
visibly-drunken man emerges
from the shadows and after a
short discussion leads the youngest
of them, ll-year-old Angela
Gatune, away.
In Meru South district, hundreds
of underage girls are being
pushed into prostitution by worsening
economic conditions, over-
; loaded school curriculum, and a
culture that has always treated
women as second-class citizens.
Three months ago, Angela was
an innocent 11- year-old child
who liked to play hide-and-seek
within the security of her mothers
house in the drought-hit Mutino
village in Tharaka Division. But
as the impact of drought sunk in,
her family decided to remove her
from school so she could seek
employment to help feed her family
and also educate her two
brothers.
After a week of wondering
from house-to-house looking for
employment, she found herself in
Chuka town with no job, money,
shelter or security, That's how
she became part of Gatwiri's
group; the offer of shelter and
food was too tempting for a hungry
girl to resist.
Once considered a universal
crime, the trade in children's
flesh is increasingly being
regarded simply as a business,
with support from tour agencies,
affluent travellers, outdated tradi-
.tions and even from governments
which have failed to enact effective
laws to safeguard children,
especially girls.
As early as 1994, World Watch
magazine had warned that child
prostitution had become a multibillion-
dollar industry and that
children were being traded like
commodities. Although Kenya is
yet to gain the notoriety of the
world's leading capitals of the
child sex industry, evidence
shows that the number of underage
girls peddling sex for a living
is increasing at an alarming rate
both in towns and villages.
At 14 years, Gatwiri is already
a seven-year-old veteran of the
streets. Born in the slums of Nanyuki
town, she ventured into the
streets at seven. Seven years later,
she claims to have slept with an
uncountable number of men, procured
four abortions and is a veteran
of Kenyans juvenile remand
homes. As far as she can remember,
her only contact with formal
education was her frequent visits
to Nanyuki schools to scavenge
for left-overs which was her main
upkeep.
Is she aware of HIV/Aids and
the dangers she has been exposing
herself to? "Over the years, I
have watched many of my friends
succumb to a myriad of illnesses,"
she admits but quickly adds
that 90 per cent of her customers
will not agree to use a condom.
According to the Progress of
sexuality in Meru South District.
One of the volunteers, Kenneth
Murithi, says that as many as 50
per cent girls in this age category
have misperception about risks of
contracting Aids. He says that
the majority of men seeking sex
with underage girls are mainly
motivated by a misplaced desire
to protect themselves from the
disease since they believe that
young girls are free of the virus.
"On the contrary, most of the
girls roaming the streets suffer
from many forms of sexually
group has 16 members ranging
between 11 and 14 years. "Hunting"
in a pack ensures their surviva~'
she says. When a member
is arrested, they are able to contribute
money to bail her out and
they are also able to keep track of
the whereabout of each group
member. This is because Some
men are known to collect girls
from the streets and lock them up
in secret houses where they are
used as sex slaves.
Gatwiri says their greatest enemies
are the police and older
prostitutes who attack and rob
them, accusing them of undercharging
customers and thus
downgrading the business. "But
they are only jealous because we
attract more attention," she adds.
She also cites cases ofuncooperative
customers who demand
odd forms of sex "but are unwilling
to pay for the extra risks". To
them rape is an initiation." Many
times, a member of our groups
turns up gang-raped and assaulted
but we are helpless since we cannot
turn to the police for protection,"
she says.
But not all underage girls are
pushed to the streets by economic
difficulties.
Lillian Muthoni comes from a
relatively well-off family. Her
father is a teacher and also a
farmer. She claims she was
for~e9 to run away from home
when school life became difficult.
A slow learner, she was forced to
repeat classes and was still in
class five when her peers were
sitting for standard eight examination.
Today she blames her uncompromising
father and teachers
who she claims had reduced her
to a laughing stock among the
school community. Although she
readily agrees that life at home
was more comfortable and lesshazardous,
she is not ready to go
back and has shaken off several
attempts by her parents to take
her back.
As troubling as· it may sound,
the explosion of child prostitution
in Kenya boils down to market
forces of supply and demand. A
community destabilised by HIVAids
pandemic, increasing poverty
amidst political lmcertainty
and the rapidly-widening gap
between the rich and the poor is
producing more potential victims
and more: potential exploiters of
innocent children.
In the world of child prostitution,
no story is more heartwrenchin"
than that of a child
who has 'been deceived or forced
by violence into the trade. But it
is perhaps more tragic when parents
who have no criminal record
push their daughters to the streets
to fend for themselves.
In Kenya today, a boy is more
likely to get basic education than
a girl. With little prospects of
making it in any other field, a girl
child will easily be enticed by
men into early sex and if anything
goes wrong, they turn to the
streets to earn a living.
Unfortunately, those who end
up in the streets experience a
world that alternately uses and
rejects them. Passed from the
security of their homes into the
hands of sex-crazed men, many
child prostitutes are not empowered
enough to feel wronged by
society. Their predominant feeling
is fear of being abused by the
next customer and a shame of
being involved in a dirty trade.
