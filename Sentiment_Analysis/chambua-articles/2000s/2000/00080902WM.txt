His mother had\r\n\r\ntravelled to Kakamega for a\r\n\r\nfuneral and he had been left in\r\n\r\nNairobi with his artist father as he\r\n\r\ngoes to school.\r\n\r\nJohn weeps as he recounts this.\r\n\r\nAs 1 saw the women he had\r\nand they said he had been\r\n\r\n\r\nstopped along the way by a man.\r\n\r\nWhen he delayed in returning, '1\r\n\r\nwent to look for him and found\r\n\r\nhim sprawled on the ground,\r\n\r\ngrimacing. When 1 tried to lift\r\n\r\n\r\nhim up, he fell over. That was\r\n\r\n\r\nParents should\r\n\r\nteach their children\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat kind of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntouches are\r\nappropriate and\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich ones are not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen 1 discovered blood coming\r\n\r\nfrom his shorts.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe boy pointed to some train\r\n\r\n\r\ncoaches in the area saying Baba\r\n\r\n\r\nMaggie, who had hUlt him, was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe man was arrested and tests\r\n\r\n\r\ndone which confirmed the boy\r\n\r\n\r\nhad been sexually molested.

He says a gang calling\r\n\r\n\r\nitself \"42 Brothers\" is terrorising\r\n\r\nchildren in Makongeni.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn says the man offered him\r\n\r\n\r\nSh20 000 out of court settlement\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbut that he declined to take it as\r\n\r\n\r\nhis son might be .in danger of\r\n\r\ndying from HIV infection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever Police spokesman\r\n\r\nPeter Kimanthi says the man was\r\n\r\n\r\ntaken to court on August 2 and\r\ncharged with the offence.\r\n\r\n\r\nKimanthi says the sexual mo-\r\nlestation of boys is hardly ever\r\nreported to the police. \"This is an\r\n\r\noffence that is rare iri our records\r\n\r\n\r\n~Ithough this does pot mean it\r\n\r\ndoes not happen,\" he says.\r\n\r\nKenya and his wife were\r\nshocked when they were told by a\r\ndoctor their two-yeariold son had\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen infected with: a sexually\r\ntransmitted disease. :\r\n\r\nSuspecting the house maid\r\n\r\ncould have been the culprit, they\r\nlaid th~ trap and caught her red-\r\n\r\nhanded.\r\nGladys, a teacher, says al-\r\nthough cases of boys ,getting sex-\r\nually molested are on the in-\r\n\r\n\r\ncrease, they are ever mentioned\r\n\r\nas attention is always resting on\r\n\r\n\r\ngirls ..\r\n\r\n\r\nPaediatricians are reporting an\r\n\r\n\r\nincrease in sodomy c~ses against\r\n\r\nl\r\n\r\nchildren ..\r\n\r\nThe director of Am ni Counsel-\r\n\r\n\r\nling Centre, Mr Mi~e Moloney\r\n\r\n\r\nsays abusers of boys have psy-\r\n\r\nchological problems Qr their sex-\r\n\r\n\r\nual desires are not being fulfilled.\r\nWhile some may be:unmarried,\r\n\r\n\r\nothers are using sexJal abuse to\r\nshow their power.       :\r\n\"They want to show they are\r\n\r\npowerful by abusing the power-\r\nless. As they do this, they threaten\r\nthe children they are abusing,\r\n\r\nmaking them feel guilty. Abuse is\r\n\r\nalways connected. with power\r\n\r\ncomplexes.\"\r\n\r\nHe explains that a house girl\r\n\r\nwho abuses an employer's son\r\n\r\ncould be doing so out of anger\r\n\r\nagainst the employer. The same\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nso a devilish act. There are people\r\n\r\nwho look out for virgins for\r\n\r\ncleansing rituals for example\r\n\r\nfrom Aids or other evil-spirits-\r\n\r\nrelated diseases. Children are the\r\n\r\n\r\nbest targets. It's no wonder cases\r\n\r\n\r\nof child abuduction are on the\r\nrise,\" says a parent who is con-\r\ncerned with devil worship activi-\r\n\r\n\r\nties inthe country.\r\nTo guard against abuse, Molo-\r\n\r\nney says parents     should. teach\r\n\r\ntheir children what kind of touch-\r\nes are appropriate and which ones\r\n\r\nare not. \"You could do this\r\nthrough dfawing an outline of the\r\nhuman body and using it to illus-\r\n\r\ntrate what you are teaching,\" he\r\n\r\n\r\nsays.\r\n\r\nChildren, he says, should be\r\n\r\n\r\nencouraged to tell parents if any\r\n\r\n\r\none tries      to abuse     them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Caution them against. talking\r\n\r\nto strangers or accepting anything\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom them,\" he says, adding that\r\n\r\n\r\nthey should also be advised\r\n\r\n\r\nagainst going toby an adult homes\r\nunaccompanied anyone's fami-\r\n\r\n\r\nly member or accepting to enter\r\n\r\nsomeone's car without their par-\r\n\r\nents' permission."}
