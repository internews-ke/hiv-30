School crisis" calls
for urgent action
The full weight of the famine is yet to be felt. But clearly
it is set to be more serious than others we have experi-
enced in recent years. It is for this reason that the govern-
ment is now looking for ways of obviating its impact and,
among other things, waiving taxes on imported maize.
   One of the areas that have felt the hunger pangs is
education, which, according to conservative government
estimates, has witnessed a massive dropout in an enrol-
ment of about two million children in recent months.
Independent surveys, however, indicate that up to three
million children have dropped out of school for reasons
closely associated with poverty and, specifically, famine.
   It is against this background that Education Minister
Stephen Kalonzo Musyoka issued a directive to
headteachers in famine-hit areas to waive levies that,
compounded by the food burden, may force parents to
withdraw their children from schools and, ultimately,
push the dropout portfolio higher.
