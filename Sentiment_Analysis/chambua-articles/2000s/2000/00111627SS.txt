Worldwide, over 190,000 women die from the disease annually. East and\r\n    Southern Africa have the second highest rates of cancer deaths. This is due to the relative lack of screening programmes to prevent the progression of the\r\n    illness and the lack of information among women of the need to go for screening. The bulk of cervical cancer cases are associated with sexual y transmitted\r\n    infection. If detected early, this disease is\r\n    curable.
