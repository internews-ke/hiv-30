 Challenges facing
 education sector
As schools countrywide         re-open tomorrow,       it's time to
reflect on the challenges facing the education sector in this
millennium and the way forward.
   The government's     goals to enhance the quality of educa-
tion and reverse all losses made in the last century have
remained elusive and the sector has been bogged down by a
myriad of setbacks every passing year.
   Notable    though, is the fact that the government           has
increased' its annual allocations to the sector in the last 10
years. The primary sector has especially           benefited from
more than 60 per cent Qfthe education recurrent budget.
   Sa':1ly, however,   more than 80 per cent of the funds
devot.'~d to education     have gone into paying salaries for
teache;s and lecturers leaving parents to shoulder the greater
burden     of operations,     stationery    and maintenance      of
schools.
   This imbalance distribution       of funds is largely to blame
for the <ieclining fortunes in the sector.
   The gross enrolment rate at the early childhood level has
remained consistently      low, standing at 34 per cent despite
official proclamations    in the last decade to the effect that the     MONDAY VIEW
rate would be raised to 50 per cent by the end of the 20th
 century.                                                    '

 due to lack of opportunities    and the transition rate to sec-

     The greatest challenge to the sector is, however, posed by
