   Make Aids drugs
   affordable to all
  ~t is right and proper that the government and all its partners
  III the fight against Aids should emphasise, as they have                                                                                                               ~I?
  done so far, prevention rather than cure as the first line of
  defence against the human immunodeficiency virus.                                                                                                                          $,-
      And yet, the debilitating effects of Aids on the population
  are increasingly becoming all too apparent. A great number
  of useful, active and youthful people infected with HIV are
  enfeebling the country's health institutions with demands on                                                                                                                  ~.
  drugs and facilities to treat the myriad opportunistic infec-
  tions. In some areas, more than half the bedspaces in major
  hospitals are occupied by Aids patients.
      They cannot be turned away without treatment, and yet,
 there are other patients who need the health facilities, too.
  There is a continuing campaign to shift the strain visited on
 hospitals by Aids patients to homes where they can receive
 care among family, but even this approach has its
 limitations.
     A plan to provide cheap and affordable medication that
 would allow people to live longer, healthier lives and con-
 tinue to contribute to their families and society seems to be
 lacking.
     But access to Aids medication has proved critical in pro-
 longing lives to a considerable degree in developed coun-                   NEWS ANALYSIS
 tries. The provision of Aids drugs is a way .of ensuring that
 those who are infected with HIV contribute to society fully
 and endure their ailments with a measure of human dignity.
     Viewed against this background, the on-going meetings                 Political chan,geturns
 between the government and five multi-national drug com-
 panies to negotiate agreeable prices for anti-retroviral drugs
 are a welcome step in making drugs for managing Aids-
 related ailments affordable to the majority of Kenyans.
     The current price of anti-retroviral drugs in Kenya,                  into ethnic violence
 pegged at around Sh30,000 a month, is clearly beyond the
 means of many people, the majority of whom are living on
 less than Sh100 a day.
