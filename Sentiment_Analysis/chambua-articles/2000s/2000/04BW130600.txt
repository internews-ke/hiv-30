FORGET THE ECONOMICS
POVERTY HAS RISEN BY 10 PC IN FIVE YEARS

"Trickle-down" economics is not
working! With per capita income
at roughly the same level as it
was in 1988 (and these were' the
heady days of 4-5 per cent
growth), and an increasing
number of Kenyans living on
less than a dollar and eating less
than 2,250 calories every day,
poverty is the one economic indicator
that has gone up over the
past year.
From around 40 per cent in
1994; the national poverty level
has risen steeply to 50 per cent
in 1999 - effectively an increase
of 10 percentage points in
five years! Simply put, at this
rate of economic deterioration,
90 per cent of Kenyans will be
wallowing in poverty at the time'
we expected to join the NIC
ranks in 2020! Clearly this is
unacceptable, and a radical rethink
in national strategy is necessary
to pull Kenya out of the
morass.
Yet, paradoxically, Kenya has
performed well in meeting its
other macro-economic targets.
For most of the past decade, the
govemment has emphasised the
importance of maintaining single
digit inflation rates, low interest
rates and stable foreign exchange
rates.
These were the three pillars of
the government's strategy for
economic growth. In isolation,
the targets for these three pillars
have been met, but benefits are
not trickling down, and the public,
-producers and consumers are
far from celebrating.
, Inflation is a real success story.
We have not forgotten the
high inflation rates of 1993,
which made living almost unbearable
for many people. The
government committed to maintaining
single digit inflation and
this has certainly been the case
for the last two years. In 1999,
we recorded the lowest official
rate of 3.5 per cent yet.
, Slow. growth in agriculture
over the past two years (1.5 per
cent in 1998 and 1.2 per cent in
1999), as well as continued increases
in petroleum prices and
the delayed effects of the shilling's
depreciation continue to
exert pressure on consumer prices.
Indeed, these inflationary
pressures are likely to persist,
given the famine and drought situation
prevalent in many parts of
the country.
The slowdown in money supply
growth is a moderating factor
in inflation management, and
this is reflected in falling rates of
underlying inflation during the
year. In this regard, at least it is
commendable that we are living
within our budget and avoiding
borrowing heavily from expen-
'sive local sources.
However, the slowdown in
spending h'as negative repercussions.
Infrastructure remains
largely neglected and most sectors
of the economy are in glaringly
bad shape.
Recent increased spending on
road repairs, particularly in urban
areas, will increase money
supply. Kenya's development
partners are not yet ready to release
substantial amounts of
money for public works. And the
funds under fuel levy, unless ac-·
cumulated over the years, may
not be sufficient to for the required
investment. This suggests
that funding other than the EI
Nino rehabilitation programme
will be obtained from expensive
local borrowing.
Borrowers are not taking the
bait of lower interest rates ..
Building on the argument, and
the observation that high interest
rates were slowing down the
economy, it.was assumed that if
the government reduced its borrowing
from the private sector
those funds would be available
to local investors at lower and
more attractive rates. (See table
elsewhere) Interest rates on the
91-days Treasury bill, and in reality
for all other facilities,
reached their lowest level in
three years at the beginning of
1999. They rallied with the
Treasury bill rate, increasing by
about 10 percentage points by
the end of the year. Interest on
commercial bank deposits followed
the same pattern. As is
usual at this time of the year,
T-bill rates have fallen dramatically
again (to around II per
cent), but borrowers still refuse
to bite!
The low interest rate experience
of 1999 did nothing to build
demand for credit. As the table
shows, overdraft rates remain
"upwardly mobile but downwardly
sticky", while business is
looking for a stable interest rate
around the 20 per cent level. The
general slowing of the economy
has also created little incentive
to borrow. Indeed, _the government
may be the only beneficiary
as it was able to settle its Treasury
bill obligations at a lower
rate for the year.
1999 was an interesting year
for the financial sector. Two
commercial banks were resuscitated,
and the Central Bank
shows every sign of maintaining
and improving further the discipline
of the sector. These are
welcome and confidencebuilding
signs given the erosion
of public faith of the recent past,
which followed the collapse of
some banks and disclosures on
non-performing loans.
The future for commercial
banks in Kenya is of interest.
They see limited retums from
smaller customers, and their traditional
agricultural businesses,
and continue to focus on risk--
free T-bill investments. Alternative
service providers for these
less profitable groups are not
emerging quickly enough. At the
close of 1999, average liquidity
'of commercial banks exceeded
by a factor of two the minimum
liquidity requirement.
The falland fall of the shilling:
Even though the shilling has
been losing ground against the
major trading currencies in the
world for a long time now, critics
maintain that it is overvalued.
Their main argument is that Kenya
generates insufficient foreign
exchange through either trade or
services to maintain such a
strong shilling.
Support by government intervention
is a thing of the past, and
many feared the flight of "hot
money" chasing the most attractive
T-bill rates. The table elsewhere
indicates that these fears
were unjustified. There was little
depreciation of the shilling with
the lowering of interest on Treasury
bills.
One can easily conclude that
there is no direct relationship between
Treasury bill rate and the
exchange rate based on the table.
Markets do react sentimentally.
They reflect hopes and possibilities
of realising large credits in
the immediate future from IMF
and World Bank. These are mirrored
in the appreci~tion of the
shilling between September and
December 1999 with the negotiations
for resumption of fin!lncial
aid, as are the effects ofrecent
claims about land grabbing.
Kenyans, fewer than we
thought. good news or bad? Historically,
Kenya's high population
growth rate is regarded as a
key factor in the decline of available
services and per capita income.
Population grew at an average
of 3.4 per cent per year
between 1979 and 1989, and was
a matter of national and international
concern. Rates have fallen
since, to 2.9 per cent between
1989 and 1999, and to 2.4 in
1999. Future growth is projected
at.2.0 per cent.
As a result, and contrary to
popular expectation, the recent
Census provides a result of 28.7
million, far lower than the ,30
million population estimated as
recently as the end of 1998.
Although the population
growth rate has slackened, the
country's education system continues
to chum out valuable potential
resources into a labour
market with very limited employment
opportunities~
Economic slowdown means jobs
particularly in formal employment
stagnate: '
Total employment grew by
7.7 per cent between 1998 and
1999, against annual increase in
labour supply of 500,000 people
each year (10 per cent of total
employment). The informal s~ctor
continues to be the largest
employer in Kenya. However,
there is much underemployment
in this sector, and value-added
remains low. This sector is the
fastest growing sector in the
economy, and is a key driver for
poverty alleviation. [t requires
specific focus and support particularly
of quality control, prodUct
marketing and credit.
The HIV/Aids scourge in
Kenya is real and impacts heavily
on bot~ mortality rates and labour
output. At the end of 1999,
it was estimated that more than
2.2 million Kenyans were living
with HIV, and that we lose more
than 500 people dai ly to
