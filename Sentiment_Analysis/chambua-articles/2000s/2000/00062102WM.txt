{"text": "\ufeffDAILY NATION, WEDNESDAY, JUNE 21, 2000\r\nFEATURE\r\n\r\nDEATH OF INNOCENCE OR AGE OF KNOW - IT - ALLS?\r\nExperts say parents are shocked to know how much their children know about sex.\r\nThe reaction is more often damaging. How do you talk to them about sex or their sexuality?\r\n\r\n \r\nBy KWAMBOKA OYARO\r\n\"I was shocked one day when I\r\nwent to check on the children in\r\nthe bedroom and I found my\r\nseven- year-old son with a fouryear-\r\nold niece in the same bed\r\nkissing and ... I could not\r\nbelieve my eyes. When they\r\nnoticed me, they jumped out of\r\nbed and started begging me not\r\nto beat them. Oh, so they knew it\r\nwas wrong!\r\nI held them and 1 cried. God, I\r\nasked, what is going on? 1 asked\r\nthem who taught them and they\r\nstarted pointing fingers at each\r\nother. The boy accused the girl...\r\nI asked the girl and she told me\r\na neighbour's son back at home\r\nhad taught her.\r\nWhat was even shocking was\r\nto learn that my boy had been\r\nshown this behaviour by a former\r\nhousehelp . They shared the bedroom.\r\nWhat is the world coming\r\nto? I asked aloud. I broke down\r\nand cried. When 1 pulled myself\r\ntogether, I prayed for God's\r\nforgiveness.\r\nI asked the househelp whether\r\nshe had discovered anything\r\n_ strange with the two and she told\r\nme she had found them \"doing\r\nsomething bad\" in the bathroom.\r\nShe had reprimanded them but\r\nnever told me. 1 realised how\r\nnaive I had been. The two loved\r\nshowering together. The girl\r\nalways asked the boy to scrub\r\nher. I would hear giggling and\r\nlaughter - then silence in the\r\nbathroom but I never thought\r\nthere was anything. After all they\r\nare children.\"\r\nCynthia is nine years old and\r\nshe has a boyfriend. At class\r\nthree she understands many\r\nthings about sex but her parents\r\nassume she is still too young to\r\nbe taught sexuality.\r\n\"I had a boyfriend when 1 was\r\nin class one. He was in class four.\r\nHe would bring me gifts like\r\nsweets, handkerchiefs and other\r\nnice things that his mother\r\ncooked. Then we would play \"the\r\nadult game.\" He thought me what\r\nlove was all about and learnt\r\nabout sex from him.\"\r\nAt seven, Maureen knew about\r\nsex and getting babies. How did\r\nshe learn about it?\r\n\"We had a neighbour who was\r\nnewly married. We played with\r\nolder children who told us what\r\nthey did when they locked their\r\ndoor. We watched through a hole\r\non the door and saw everything.\r\nSoon she was pregnant and got a\r\nchild and the older children\r\nexplained to us the process of\r\ngetting a baby.\"\r\nWhen George was five he was\r\ntold about the condom and how it\r\nis used. \"We played with them as\r\nballoons but we knew what they\r\nwere. A boy who gave us the\r\ncondoms for inflating took them\r\nfrom his mother, a social\r\nworker.\r\nPaul and Josh were playing at\r\nthe court outside their house\r\nwhen a neighbour's son in secondary\r\nschool decided to show\r\nthem a blue movie.\r\n\"I was amazed at the things I\r\nwatched. Every time I watched\r\nthe door thinking my mother will\r\nwalk in and strangle me. This\r\nis when I told Josh that we\r\nshould leave. The image\r\nremained with me for a long\r\ntime and every time I saw a\r\ngirl, I imagined how she\r\nlooked without clothes,\" says\r\nPaul, then six.\r\nNursery and lower primary\r\nschool children are knowledgeable\r\nabout sex, says Ben\r\nKamau, a teacher at a Nairobi primary\r\nschool.\r\n\"When you mention something\r\nto do with reproduction, the girls\r\ngiggle and the boys are excited.\r\nThey are not like us when we\r\ngre~ up without knowing these\r\nthings. They can explain to you\r\nthe process of love-making until\r\nyou are shocked. I guess they\r\nwatch television a lot.\"\r\nWhile still in nursery school,\r\nRowena was exposed to adult literature.\r\nAt five, she knew about\r\nsex.\r\n\"I-left school at noon every day\r\nand there was nobody to play\r\nwith. I watched television or read\r\nmy parents' books which were\r\nfull of explicit sex topics. By the\r\ntime I reached class one, I would\r\nread David Maillu's pornographic\r\nbooks,\" says 17-year-old\r\nRowena.\r\nShe says her parents did not\r\nknow how to choose children's\r\nbooks and left their books where\r\nshe would fintl them and read.\r\nCharles was in class three when\r\nother boys laughed at him that he ,\r\nhad not had sex. He was ashamed.\r\nNow in class four, he has a\r\ngirlfriend in class two.\r\n\"Very young girls talk about\r\nsex and they provoke boys to\r\nseduce them,\" says the shy\r\n10-year-old.\r\nMathew was introduced to sex\r\nby a househelp long before he\r\nwent to school. She would call\r\nhim from his friends and ask him\r\nto assist her in folding clothes.\r\n\"In the process she would put\r\nme on top of her and what fo]-\r\nlowed I never understood until\r\nmuch ]ater.\"\r\nWith explicit television programmes\r\nand well informed\r\nfriends, young children are\r\nexposed to sex very early.\r\nMrs Anne Mutua, a counselling\r\nteacher at Nairobi Girls says\r\nparents must talk to their children\r\nabout sex as soon as they are able LU .\u2022 ' \"-\r\nto understand.\r\n\"Some parents assume that\r\ntheir children are too young to\r\nknow about sex or their sexuality.\r\nOther parents start telling their\r\ndaughters about menstruation\r\nlong after the onset of their periods.\r\nIt is awkward then because\r\nthe girls have already learnt from\r\nfriends.\"\r\nExperts say parents will be\r\nshocked to know how much their\r\nbabies know about sex. \"Parents\r\nthink that their children are the\r\ninnocent babies they were changing\r\ndiapers not long ago. But with\r\nvast information, even four-yearold\r\nchildren know too much\r\nabout sex.\"\r\nHowever, some parents use a\r\ncrude approach in warning their\r\nchildren about sex.\r\n\"My mother told me that if! let\r\na boy touch me I would get pregnant\r\nor get Aids. Then 1 was\r\nseven and I had been told about\r\nMachine generated alternative text: Dear Amani,\r\ndaughters about menstruation\r\nlong after the onset of their peri\r\nods. It is awkward then because\r\nthe girls have already learnt from\r\nfriends.\u201d\r\nExperts say parents will be\r\nshocked to know how much their\r\nbabies know about sex. \u201cParents\r\nthink that their children are the\r\ninnocent babies they were chang\r\ning diapers not long ago. But with\r\nvast information, even four-year-\r\nold children know too much\r\nabout sex.\u201d\r\nHowever, some parents use a\r\ncrude approach in warning their\r\nchildren about sex.\r\n\u201cMy mother told me that if I let\r\na boy touch me I would get preg\r\nnant or get Aids. Then 1 was\r\nseven and L had been told about\r\nmenstruation and pregnancy by\r\nolder girls. I thought my mother\r\nwas a liar and when I was 10, 1\r\ndid it with my boyfriend to prove\r\nher wrong,\u201d says Catherine, aged\r\n13.\r\nThis does not work since the\r\nchildren are already quite\r\ninformed. However, parents can\r\nstop this trend, says counsellor\r\nand nurse Florence Ngaira of\r\nPeace Medical Clinic.\r\n\u201cParents should now take it\r\nupon themselves to open up to\r\ntheir children about sex when\r\nthey are still young. Many par\r\nents leave their children to grow\r\nup without knowing the dangers\r\nor significance of sex. When the\r\nknowledge comes from their par\r\nents it is not misleading as when\r\nit comes from friends.\u201d\r\nMichael Moloney, Director\r\nAmani counselling Centre, says\r\nit\u2019s wrong to discipline four year\r\nolds if you find them kissing or\r\ntouching private pans. \u201cIf you\r\nspank them, you will leave them\r\nconfused. They will wonder why\r\nyou are so upset.\u201d\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t panic, he advices.\r\n\u201cOpen a dialogue so that they can\r\ntell you how, who showed them.\r\nBuild it up into a learning experi\r\nence. Tell them why it\u2019s not\r\nproper to touch each other\u2019s geni\r\ntals and why they should avoid\r\nwatching sexy videos or pro\r\ngrammes.\r\nChildren, he says, are curious.\r\nAfter all, they watch these sexy\r\nscenes every day on TV pro\r\ngrammes aired long before bed\r\ntime. They touch each other the\r\nway they would touch a teddy\r\nbear or a doll. Deal with the\r\nsources of influence intelligently,\r\nhe advices.\r\nI know this lady who was in\r\nlove with a man and they\r\nmoved together for a couple of\r\nyears. Then somehow they\r\nsplit and the man found\r\nanother girl friend and the\r\nlady found another friend too.\r\nHowever one day they hap\r\npened to meet in a bar and the\r\nold boy friend started abusing\r\nhis former girlfriend and then\r\nhe beat her up.\r\nMy question \u00a1s, does this\r\nshow that he really loved her\r\nand didn\u2019t want her to go in\r\nthe first place? .\r\nConcerned Lady.\r\nDear Concerned Lady,\r\nThank you for your lcttcr. Some\r\nreaders may be surprised that\r\nyou would even ask such a ques\r\nfon, others may still need to\r\nknow if there is a connection\r\nbetween beating someone and\r\nloving them.\r\nIt is a fact that when parents\r\nbeat a child they may say to\r\nthemselves and even to their\r\nchild, I am just doing this for\r\nyour own good and because\r\nreally I love you and you need\r\nto learn a lesson.\r\nSimilarly, a spouse (it is usu\r\nally, but not always, the man)\r\nmay say \u20181 love you and that is\r\nwhy I am teaching you this les\r\nson,\u2019 or, as is the case in the let\r\nter you have written - \u201cI used to\r\nlove you and I am beating you\r\nto show how angry I am that\r\nyou left.\u201d\r\nIt is only a perverted view of\r\nlove which expresses itself\r\nthrough beating the loved per\r\nson. Any normal child who is\r\nbeaten does not believe that this\r\nis an act of love. When beating\r\n. is a part of family life, it may\r\nproduce outward obedience but\r\ninwardly there will be resent\r\nment and even hatred and the\r\nchild will learn to lie and\r\ndeceive in order to avoid being\r\nbeaten.\r\nDear Concerned Lady, in the\r\nexample you have given the\r\nbeating is nothing more than a\r\ndisplay of power. The woman\r\nbecomes an object to be pos\r\nsessed and used. She is there for\r\nthe benefit of the man If she\r\nleaves then it is her Iauh. No\r\none else has any rights over the\r\nformer girlfriend. If she is seen\r\nwith anyone else then jealousy\r\nand anger produce physical vio\r\nlence.\r\nAnyone who thinks that being\r\nbeaten is the sign of another\u2019s\r\nLove is in danger of entering into\r\nan abusive relationship.\r\nLove, in every culture, is\r\nshown through concern, under\r\nstanding and respect for the\r\npartners. There is nothing manly\r\nor attractive in beating up a\r\nwoman. It is not a sign of\r\nstrength but of weakness.\r\nYour friend is to be congratu\r\nkited for splitting from an abu\r\nsive relationship.\r\n\u2022The Amani Counselling Cen\r\ntre Courses start on Saturday\r\nJune 24. The are on parent-\r\n\u00a1ng, communication skills,\r\nHly Aids Counselling. Call to\r\nbook."}
