    Cervical cancer is a leading cause of cancer deaths, among women in Kenya. Worldwide, over 190,000 women die from the disease annually. East and
    Southern Africa have the second highest rates of cancer deaths. This is due to the relative lack of screening programmes to prevent the progression of the
    illness and the lack of information among women of the need to go for screening. The bulk of cervical cancer cases are associated with sexual y transmitted
    infection. If detected early, this disease is
    curable. Family Planning Association of Kenya
    has int~nsified its fight against cervical cancer.
    Over the past decade, between eight and 20                                                                          Family Planning
