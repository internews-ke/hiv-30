 September.                            -
     Several branches of the Kenya National Union of Teach-
 ers (KNUT) have, in fact, defied their national leaders and
 called for a strike to halt the transfers.
     As a result, some questions need to be addressed. What is -
 the purpose of the transfers? Are teachers justified in oppos-
 ing them? Is the timing right?
     According to the government, the objective is to ensure
 even distribution of teacher~ throughout the country, on the
 premise that certain regions have an excess of teachers
 while the hardship areas, including arid and semi-arid lands,
 are understaffed.
      For instance, a district like Meru Central has a surplus of
  1,006 teachers while Kitui, in the same province, is under-
  staffed by 488. Such anomalies must be redressed urgently.
      After all, it is economically unjustifiable to have on the
  payron teachers who are not productive, especially at a time
  when the entire public service is being rationalised.
      At any rate, all teachers sign a contract with the govern-
  ment that obliges them to serve in any part of the country.             NEWS FEATURE
  Which makes it ridiculous for the same teachers, through
  their union officials, to turn around and reject transfers.
      An issue that" needs to be considered, however, is the              Mbeki -bashing ruled
  timing. Procedurally, the Teachers Service Commission
  transfers teachers at the beginning of it term to ensure conti-
   nuity. Posting a teacher to a school in the middle of the term "
   disrupts learning programmes. It is for this reason that the
   timing has been opposed. It is likely to be disruptive.                out at Aids talks in SA
 " Though teachers swear to serve in all parts of the country,
   there are certain mitigating circumstances that make it diffi-
   cult for some to go and live in certain areas, including phys-
   ical disability, poor health and marital considerations.                                                                                                              specifics relevant to our situation, which
