By KARIUKI WAIHENYA
Teachers yesterday demanded the
withdrawal of a circular directing
education officers to list those
suffering from Aids.
They also demanded an apol
ogy from the Teachers Service
Commission and accused the sec
reLary Mr Benjamin Sogonio of
being unprofessional.
Mr Sogomo told the Nation
yesterday that the commission
did not intend to go round check-
¡ng the health status of teachers
but only required information on
the death rate of teachers without
giving any names tu the educa
tion officers.
Press reports indicated yester
day that the TSC had in a circular
signed by Mr Sogomo instructed
all district and municipal educa
tion officers to compile a list of
all sickly eachcrs to determine
the number of Aids sufferers.
The details sought include sta
tistics on how many tcahers may
be too weak to perform their
dUties and how many have died of
Aids in the previous month.
The Kenya National Union of
Teachers threatened to throw the
education sector into disarray if
the circular was not withdrawn.
Deputy Secretary general Fran
Cis Nganga said: “The circular
was carelessly done, alarmist and
intended to dìscriminatc against
and condemn teachers, Wfo is a
sickly teacher? Doesn’t the TSC
know that HIV tests can only be
carried out by qualiÍied personnel
and that there is no law compel
ling teachers to undertake the
tests?”
I lowever, a copy of the circu
lar obtained by the Notion
revealed that it had been copied
to the teachers union.
It reads: “Heads of schools are
informed that cases of teachers
who arc too weak to cariy out
their teaching duties should be
treated as patients of any other
disease and be handled as per the
code of regulations for teachers.’
Meanwhile, the Kenya Human
Rights Commission said th cir
cular was disturbing because it
meant that the Aids scourge was
emerging as a discrimination cri
tena in work places.
The Programmes Officer for
Advocacy, Mr igambi Kiai.
said that Aids sufferers should not
be discriminated against as long
as they did nor threaten the health
of others and were able to dis
charge their duties and
responsibilities.
