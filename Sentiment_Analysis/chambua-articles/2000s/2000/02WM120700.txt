YOU NEED NOT FEEL ASHAMED

Dear Amani,

I am a regular reader of your
column and it has really
helped me in some areas.
I have a problem which has
been bothering me for a long
time. When I was 22 years (I
am now 28) I was raped by a
man and infected with STD's
of which I became aware
after three months due to
abdominal pains. I was
treated and the final test
showed that I was O.K. But
from that time until now I
still have abdominal pain.
Recently I saw a doctor and
she told me it is PID. Pelvic
Inflammatory Disease. She
treated me but in vain. However,
she told me that because
I had ulcers they could also
affect my condition. Sometimes
I scratch my private
parts and sometimes I feel a
burning sensation.
I am so worried. I have
never shared my experience
with anyone. From that time I
have kept myself from sex.
Sometimes I think I might be
suffering from Aids and I feel
like committing suicide even
though I am a committed
Christian.
Worried Lady.


Dear worried lady,
Dear Worried Lady,
Thank you for your letter. You
have taken a very
wise step in writing
to us, for, as you
say in your letter "I
have never shared
this, even with a
friend." This statement
tells me much about
your problem.
Worried Lady, I read somewhere,
"we are as sick as we
are secret". At that time I
found the statement shocking
but as time passed I began to
believe that there is a lot of
truth in it.
Your secrecy is because of
the fear of telling people what
you went through six years ago.
There is fear of being misunderstood
or of being blamed for
the rape. And perhaps even you,
yourself feel a deep shame and'
guilt, as if you were responsible
for it.
It has long been held that
women who are raped only
have themselves to blame, that
in fact they lead the man on
until he can no longer control
himself. And so the rape is a.
foregone conclusion and the
woman's fault. Many women
share this belief.
It is a false belief. Fortunately,
it is beginning to go. What-'
ever were the circumstances of:.
your rape it was still a crime
and a traumatic violation of
your person. It was not your
fault,
Many women take years to
overcome the trauma of rape
even when they have been
involved in therapy, whether
group or individual. Far from
having therapy, you have
closed yourself all these yearS
from any possibility of getting
help, all because of your fear
and your shame. You have carried
a huge burden, not daring
to share it with anyone. No
wonder you are sick.
When the effects of exposure
to any severely stressful event
persist for many years, we call
this Post Traumatic Stress Disorder
(PTSD).
Rape is a severely stressful
event. You have many feelings
resulting from this trauma:
some of these you may be
aware of and others you may
have repressed. Apart from fear
and guilt, there is severe anxiety,
depression, anger, low selfesteem,
and so on.
When we repress our feelings
we are at high risk of getting
Some physical symptoms, ulcers
is one of them, and I would
think that your other symptoms
could also be the result of
repression. That, of course
would need to be checked out.
Until we deat' with our feelings
,the chances are that the symp-
'toms will remain.
Worried Lady, you say you
have kept yourself from sex
. since the time of the rape. My
question is; what made you
"keep yourself' from sex? The
experience of rape can cause a
person to turn off sex altogether
because rape is an act of vio-
. lence using sex as a weapon.
Rape is not
predominantly
a sexual
act, it is
violence.
Once a person
has had the
experience of sex abused in this
way, that person can be affected
so negatively that the sexual act
will tend to be experienced in
the same way afterwards, even .
in the most loving relationship.
It is thus imperative for you
to be able to talk this over with
someone you can trust.
lt is not a bad thing to get an
HIV test confirmed, even more
than once. But there comes a
point when you have to accept
the negative result.
How do you see yourself?
You perhaps see yourself as
violated, second hand, unlovable
and incapable of love- not
good enough for any man. You
see yourself at an age when
your peers are either planning to
get married or are already married.
And of course there are the
expectations of family and
friends. There is also the possibility
that you .have a fear and
distrust of men in general.
It is true you have been victimised
but you do not have to
go on living as a victim. Start to
free yourself by simply taking
the first step. That step, of
course, is to talk to someone
you trust - it could be a friend, a
pastor, a medical person, your
parents or a counsellor .
Twenty eight is not too old to
be a new beginning for you;
Worried Lady,
If you do not live too far
away from Nairobi, welcome to
Amani counselling Centre.
