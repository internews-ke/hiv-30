Why are they now\r\n.calling for the President to continue in power after 2002?\r\n That would clearly be against the Constitution - and they\r\n know it.\r\n    At the weekend, two Kanu MPs, Mr Musa Sinna and Mr\r\n Eric Morogo, added their voices to the cacophony, reason-                                             \u2022\u2022   0\r\n ing that there is no way the President can leave this country\r\n disunited. They did not elaborate. What is the correlation\r\n'between national unity, the end of a presidential tenn of\r\n oftice and explicit constitutional limits on that incumbency?\r\n    These MPs and others are entitled to their views, but\r\n.some of their pronouncements amount to nothing more than\r\n provocative hot air ..\r\n     First, it is far from clear that Kenyans are agreed about a\r\n referendum deciding the presidential tenn. The ruling party\r\n has on more than one occasion said as much whenever the             SPECIAL REPORT\r\n Qpposition has calIed for a referendum on any number of\r\n  i$sues.\r\n     S~condly, K~nya is a multip~n:Y state.

HIV: What Kenyan\r\n    There are many reasons why a country can be disunited,\r\n the principal one being the quality of its leadership. If the\r\n present leaders have not been able to unite the nation, as the\r\n MPs implicitly acknowledge, how are they expected to do\r\n so after the year 2002? If presidential incumbency depends          employers should do\r\n on factors of disunity for its perpetuation, where IS the pre-\r\n mium, for an incumbent, in alIowing unity to thrive If it\r\n signals the end of power?\r\n    Right now, Kenyans do not have enough electricity or\r\n water.
