We are turning into moral monsters

Your articles about the Aids scourge was very welcome
('Saturday', December 11, 1999). Lately, Kenyans has
been confronted by a number of moral issues including
whether or not abortion should be legalised. The
current issue is whether or not the use of condoms
should be encouraged to curb the spread of Aids. The
anti condom use proponents have prescribed a
solution which I think is very simplistic - abstain until
you are married and be faithful after that. Is it not
possible for two unmarried adult lovers to be faithful to
each other? Does it mean too that those who never get
married whether by choice or chance have no right to
ever have a sexual relationship? I had a relative who
was a nun for many years. She later left the order and
the very fir.st boyfriend she met infected her with HIV.
She died. I don't believe she was immoral. I also
believe that no human being enjoys abusing, his/her
I body by bElingimmoral, unless they are not of sound
: mind. Aids is a monster but let it not turn us into moral
: monsters. The silver lining on this dark cloud of Aids is
that it gives us the chance to become more humane.
Let us stop preaching and condemning. Let us start
caring.
