      Are fees guidelines
      too good to be true?
     The government has again released fees guidelines for sec-
     ondary schools, which at face value look friendly to parents.
     This is because many public secondary schools have ~een
     charging exorbitant fees, money that was rarely put mto
     proper use.
        Many boarding schools charge upwards of SMO,OOOa
     year, a figure far above the reach of many parents. As a
     result, many children have been for,:ed out of school.       .
        While everyone may celebrate thIS good news, especIally
     during these hard times,· there. an~ certain .is~ues that need to
     be addressed. First, are the guldehnes reahstlc?
        According to the government figures, national schoo!s ~re
     expec:'ed to charge a maximum of Sh22,500, provmclal
     boarding schools Sh17,250, and day scho~ls Sh6,850.
        It is instructive that headteachers of natIOnal schools were
     quick at.'d unanimous in their response, claiming the figures
     are unworkable. Their argument was that schools have dif-
     ferent requirements and therefore, expenditur:s. ~o !mpo~-
     ing a common levy without consl!ltmg the mstitutIOns. IS
     likely to create problems as there IS bound to b7 .financlal
     strain that might translate into shortages of prOVlSlons and,
     ultimately, lead to student unrest.                ....
