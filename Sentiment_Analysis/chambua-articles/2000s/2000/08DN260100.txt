       Early Piregnancies were
      rare in the past, the same
       is common today due to
       pre-marital sex. PHILIP
      MAINGE in Nakuru and
      WANGULU ELIEZER in
          Nairobi, detail how
        modernity has abetted
           moral decadence.
           -    s the condom war rages unabated, 88-
                pre-marital sex was taboo.
  A             year-old Mwangi Kinyanjui listens
                bemused. Gone are the days when
       "I had two beautiful girlfriends who loved
    me dearly. Any time they came to my thingira
    (hut), we only talked joyously. At bedtime, I
    snuggled      between them," the old man-
    reminisces.
       The girls only" allowed him to fondle their
    breasts and thighs and would not permit him to
    go beyond those limits for fea~ of pregnancy. It
    was taboo for a mature girl to have a child
    outside marriage, he says, and girls who found
    themselves with children out of wedlock were
    forced to marry old men who had other senior
    wives.                                         -
       These girls we:re called gicokio (used-up).
    The shame of being called gicokio made many
    girls to cherish chastity.
       Today, young Kenyans engage in sex at early
    ages. According to'the Population Council, sex-
    ual debut for most Kenyan youth is age 16.5 for
    boys and 15.5 for girls. Kenya has been cited as
  one of the few cOlmtries in Africa
  where
  youth engage in early sex.
      According to the 1998 Kenya
  Demographic and Health Survey,
  3.3 per cent of the majority of girls
  aged 15 years weT<: pregnant at the
-time of the survey, as were six per
  cent of those aged 16. At the same
  time, 19.6 per cent ofthe girls aged
   17; 30.1 per cent of those aged 18,
  and 44.9 per cent of girls aged 19                                        YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL: Most Kenyan cultures revered chastity before mar-
