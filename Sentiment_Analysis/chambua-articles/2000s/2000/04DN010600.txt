Gitari warns against falling prey to sects

Christians were yesterday warned
against blindly following splinter
religious groups.
The head of the Anglican
Church, Archbishop David Gitari,
said the sects placing big advertisements
in the print and electronic
media were commercially
motivated.
He said the publicity-hungry
sects were 'exploiting unsuspecting
worshippers in their mistaken
belief that all their problems
could be solved.
He said the groups, mostly
imposed on Kenyans from foreign.
countries, were suspicious in
their approach to the Christian
doctrine, and he warned Kenyans
against following them blindly.
Speaking at the Kiriithiru
Anglican Church, Murang'a District,
he said most of the new
sects claimed to possess miraculous
power to heal and solve economic
hardships.
Dr Gitari asked: "If they can
really cure diseases, why can't
they emulate Jesus when he
healed the leper and told him to
go and not to tell anyone?"
On the Aids scourge, he
reminded the youth to abstain
from premarital sex and undergo
an HIV test l;>eforethey enter into
marriage.
Marriage partners ought to
know their HIV status to make
wise choices, he said, although
this was not official church
policy.
He said the Anglican style of
worship was being reviewed to
reduce defection by the youth.
