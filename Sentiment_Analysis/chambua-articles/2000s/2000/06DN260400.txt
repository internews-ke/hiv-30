Africa needs a new
strategy on malaria
As 50 African Heads of State assemble in Nigeria for a meet-
ing with the leaders of eight industrialised nations over
malaria, there is an urgent need for the continent to define
and clearly articulate its position on this killer disease.
   The summit has been called as part of the World Health
Organisations' Roll Back Malaria campaign and seeks to

 do so because they lack access to health-care and preventive
drugs.
   And yet development of drugs alone will not eradicate t!;iis
disease from the continent. There have been demands fOr
cheap and locally-produced anti-malarial drugs which need to
 be stepped up.
    The continental and world effort should, however, only                             NEWS FEATURE
