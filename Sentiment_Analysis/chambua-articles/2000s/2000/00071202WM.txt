{"text": "\ufeffDAILY NATION, WEDNESDA Y ,JULY 12,2000\r\n\r\nYOU NEED NOT FEEL ASHAMED\r\n\r\nDear Amani,\r\n\r\nI am a regular reader of your\r\ncolumn and it has really\r\nhelped me in some areas.\r\nI have a problem which has\r\nbeen bothering me for a long\r\ntime. When I was 22 years (I\r\nam now 28) I was raped by a\r\nman and infected with STD's\r\nof which I became aware\r\nafter three months due to\r\nabdominal pains. I was\r\ntreated and the final test\r\nshowed that I was O.K. But\r\nfrom that time until now I\r\nstill have abdominal pain.\r\nRecently I saw a doctor and\r\nshe told me it is PID. Pelvic\r\nInflammatory Disease. She\r\ntreated me but in vain. However,\r\nshe told me that because\r\nI had ulcers they could also\r\naffect my condition. Sometimes\r\nI scratch my private\r\nparts and sometimes I feel a\r\nburning sensation.\r\nI am so worried. I have\r\nnever shared my experience\r\nwith anyone. From that time I\r\nhave kept myself from sex.\r\nSometimes I think I might be\r\nsuffering from Aids and I feel\r\nlike committing suicide even\r\nthough I am a committed\r\nChristian.\r\nWorried Lady.\r\n\r\n\r\nDear worried lady,\r\nDear Worried Lady,\r\nThank you for your letter. You\r\nhave taken a very\r\nwise step in writing\r\nto us, for, as you\r\nsay in your letter \"I\r\nhave never shared\r\nthis, even with a\r\nfriend.\" This statement\r\ntells me much about\r\nyour problem.\r\nWorried Lady, I read somewhere,\r\n\"we are as sick as we\r\nare secret\". At that time I\r\nfound the statement shocking\r\nbut as time passed I began to\r\nbelieve that there is a lot of\r\ntruth in it.\r\nYour secrecy is because of\r\nthe fear of telling people what\r\nyou went through six years ago.\r\nThere is fear of being misunderstood\r\nor of being blamed for\r\nthe rape. And perhaps even you,\r\nyourself feel a deep shame and'\r\nguilt, as if you were responsible\r\nfor it.\r\nIt has long been held that\r\nwomen who are raped only\r\nhave themselves to blame, that\r\nin fact they lead the man on\r\nuntil he can no longer control\r\nhimself. And so the rape is a.\r\nforegone conclusion and the\r\nwoman's fault. Many women\r\nshare this belief.\r\nIt is a false belief. Fortunately,\r\nit is beginning to go. What-'\r\never were the circumstances of:.\r\nyour rape it was still a crime\r\nand a traumatic violation of\r\nyour person. It was not your\r\nfault,\r\nMany women take years to\r\novercome the trauma of rape\r\neven when they have been\r\ninvolved in therapy, whether\r\ngroup or individual. Far from\r\nhaving therapy, you have\r\nclosed yourself all these yearS\r\nfrom any possibility of getting\r\nhelp, all because of your fear\r\nand your shame. You have carried\r\na huge burden, not daring\r\nto share it with anyone. No\r\nwonder you are sick.\r\nWhen the effects of exposure\r\nto any severely stressful event\r\npersist for many years, we call\r\nthis Post Traumatic Stress Disorder\r\n(PTSD).\r\nRape is a severely stressful\r\nevent. You have many feelings\r\nresulting from this trauma:\r\nsome of these you may be\r\naware of and others you may\r\nhave repressed. Apart from fear\r\nand guilt, there is severe anxiety,\r\ndepression, anger, low selfesteem,\r\nand so on.\r\nWhen we repress our feelings\r\nwe are at high risk of getting\r\nSome physical symptoms, ulcers\r\nis one of them, and I would\r\nthink that your other symptoms\r\ncould also be the result of\r\nrepression. That, of course\r\nwould need to be checked out.\r\nUntil we deat' with our feelings\r\n,the chances are that the symp-\r\n'toms will remain.\r\nWorried Lady, you say you\r\nhave kept yourself from sex\r\n. since the time of the rape. My\r\nquestion is; what made you\r\n\"keep yourself' from sex? The\r\nexperience of rape can cause a\r\nperson to turn off sex altogether\r\nbecause rape is an act of vio-\r\n. lence using sex as a weapon.\r\nRape is not\r\npredominantly\r\na sexual\r\nact, it is\r\nviolence.\r\nOnce a person\r\nhas had the\r\nexperience of sex abused in this\r\nway, that person can be affected\r\nso negatively that the sexual act\r\nwill tend to be experienced in\r\nthe same way afterwards, even .\r\nin the most loving relationship.\r\nIt is thus imperative for you\r\nto be able to talk this over with\r\nsomeone you can trust.\r\nlt is not a bad thing to get an\r\nHIV test confirmed, even more\r\nthan once. But there comes a\r\npoint when you have to accept\r\nthe negative result.\r\nHow do you see yourself?\r\nYou perhaps see yourself as\r\nviolated, second hand, unlovable\r\nand incapable of love- not\r\ngood enough for any man. You\r\nsee yourself at an age when\r\nyour peers are either planning to\r\nget married or are already married.\r\nAnd of course there are the\r\nexpectations of family and\r\nfriends. There is also the possibility\r\nthat you .have a fear and\r\ndistrust of men in general.\r\nIt is true you have been victimised\r\nbut you do not have to\r\ngo on living as a victim. Start to\r\nfree yourself by simply taking\r\nthe first step. That step, of\r\ncourse, is to talk to someone\r\nyou trust - it could be a friend, a\r\npastor, a medical person, your\r\nparents or a counsellor .\r\nTwenty eight is not too old to\r\nbe a new beginning for you;\r\nWorried Lady,\r\nIf you do not live too far\r\naway from Nairobi, welcome to\r\nAmani counselling Centre."}
