The\r\n once densely wooded hillsides was left\r\n bare.\r\n    But there is a ray of hope, thanks to an\r\n ambitious community based afforestation\r\n project initiated by an Irish Priest, Father\r\n John Jones, and backed by government\r\n extension staff which aims at\r\n rehabilitating 370 squares of the critical\r\n Subukia water catchment area.\r\n    At the height of the severe drought\r\n which hit Subukia and other parts ofthe\r\n country last year, a peasant farmer who\r\n had invested all his savings in a tomato\r\n crop, took a rope and hanged himself\r\n after the streams flowing from the hills\r\n dried up, ruining the farmer's entire\r\n crop.\r\n    Among the seasonal rivers which rise\r\n from the Subukia water catchment area\r\n are Gitundaga, Mumoi, Subukia,\r\n Igwamiti, Kianoe, Kinoru and the Ward\r\n Springs.\r\n    Several farmers in the Subukia Valley\r\n said they all agree with the extension\r\n officers that only the afforestation of the\r\n catchment will sustain the production of\r\n vegetables, particularly during the dry\r\n season.\r\n    Father John Jones who is in charge of\r\n the Marian Shrine has established a big\r\n tree seedlings nursery with the assistance                           Subukia Hill and Valley: Extensive forest destruction    has caused massive soil erosion on the previously hil~hly productive land.\r\n of the area agricultural extension officer\r\n Mr Muthima Githinji, the forest\r\n extension officer Mr Richard Robo and\r\n the soil and extension officer Mr Joseph       Rescuing Subukia Valley\r\n Okiring.\r\n    Mr Githinji, Mr Robo and Mr Okiring\r\n who accompanied said that farmers in\r\n the area have already been issued with\r\n 500,000 tree seedlings of species such\r\n as Prununs Africana, Mexican Green                According to the current government           By February last year for example,               Kenya's forests cover approximately          This came true this year when flash\r\n Ash, Juniperus, Olea Africana,                 Development Plan document, the total          Nakuru district had established                  three percent of the total land area which   floods sweeping down from hilly areas\r\n  Warbugia Ugandensis ( Muthiga),               area under forests in Nakuru District is      plantations covering only 55 hectares out        is under great pressure from human           where forests have been wiped out\r\n Dombea and Alubizia Gumifera.                  145,790 hectares out ofwhic1168,113           of the targeted 785.                             encroachment.                                caused widespread damage in parts of\r\n.
