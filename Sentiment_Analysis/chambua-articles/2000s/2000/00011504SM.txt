{"text": "\ufeffSaturday, January 15, 2000\r\n\r\nWe are turning into moral monsters\r\n\r\nYour articles about the Aids scourge was very welcome\r\n('Saturday', December 11, 1999). Lately, Kenyans has\r\nbeen confronted by a number of moral issues including\r\nwhether or not abortion should be legalised. The\r\ncurrent issue is whether or not the use of condoms\r\nshould be encouraged to curb the spread of Aids. The\r\nanti condom use proponents have prescribed a\r\nsolution which I think is very simplistic - abstain until\r\nyou are married and be faithful after that. Is it not\r\npossible for two unmarried adult lovers to be faithful to\r\neach other? Does it mean too that those who never get\r\nmarried whether by choice or chance have no right to\r\never have a sexual relationship? I had a relative who\r\nwas a nun for many years. She later left the order and\r\nthe very fir.st boyfriend she met infected her with HIV.\r\nShe died. I don't believe she was immoral. I also\r\nbelieve that no human being enjoys abusing, his/her\r\nI body by bElingimmoral, unless they are not of sound\r\n: mind. Aids is a monster but let it not turn us into moral\r\n: monsters. The silver lining on this dark cloud of Aids is\r\nthat it gives us the chance to become more humane.\r\nLet us stop preaching and condemning. Let us start\r\ncaring."}
