FAMILY LIFE

A father cries over son

By OGOVA ONDEGO

Four- year -old Joseph had
followerd some estate
women to draw some

water for his family on a

Friday afternoon. His mother had

travelled to Kakamega for a

funeral and he had been left in

Nairobi with his artist father as he

goes to school.

John weeps as he recounts this.

As 1 saw the women he had
and they said he had been


stopped along the way by a man.

When he delayed in returning, '1

went to look for him and found

him sprawled on the ground,

grimacing. When 1 tried to lift


him up, he fell over. That was


Parents should

teach their children


what kind of



touches are
appropriate and


which ones are not



when 1 discovered blood coming

from his shorts."


The boy pointed to some train


coaches in the area saying Baba


Maggie, who had hUlt him, was



there.


The man was arrested and tests


done which confirmed the boy


had been sexually molested. He

was admitted       to Kenyatta


National Hospital. When he went
back to Makongeni Police Station


where he was being held,
Ndung'u was told the man- had
been released on bond.

So shocked was he that he im-

tion of Women Lawyers Federa-
mediately rushed to the who is-



sued him with a letter he took to
the Nairobi Provincial Children's
office who issued him with an-


other letter to the Provincial Po-
lice Officer on the matter.

"How do you release someone

before evidence is complete-
won't he interfere with investiga-

tions?" He says the suspect is a
habitual abuser of children in the,
area and that the police never act
on him. He says a gang calling


itself "42 Brothers" is terrorising

children in Makongeni.


John says the man offered him


Sh20 000 out of court settlement



but that he declined to take it as


his son might be .in danger of

dying from HIV infection.





However Police spokesman

Peter Kimanthi says the man was


taken to court on August 2 and
charged with the offence.


Kimanthi says the sexual mo-
lestation of boys is hardly ever
reported to the police. "This is an

offence that is rare iri our records


~Ithough this does pot mean it

does not happen," he says.

Kenya and his wife were
shocked when they were told by a
doctor their two-yeariold son had


been infected with: a sexually
transmitted disease. :

Suspecting the house maid

could have been the culprit, they
laid th~ trap and caught her red-

handed.
Gladys, a teacher, says al-
though cases of boys ,getting sex-
ually molested are on the in-


crease, they are ever mentioned

as attention is always resting on


girls ..


Paediatricians are reporting an


increase in sodomy c~ses against

l

children ..

The director of Am ni Counsel-


ling Centre, Mr Mi~e Moloney


says abusers of boys have psy-

chological problems Qr their sex-


ual desires are not being fulfilled.
While some may be:unmarried,


others are using sexJal abuse to
show their power.       :
"They want to show they are

powerful by abusing the power-
less. As they do this, they threaten
the children they are abusing,

making them feel guilty. Abuse is

always connected. with power

complexes."

He explains that a house girl

who abuses an employer's son

could be doing so out of anger

against the employer. The same



so a devilish act. There are people

who look out for virgins for

cleansing rituals for example

from Aids or other evil-spirits-

related diseases. Children are the


best targets. It's no wonder cases


of child abuduction are on the
rise," says a parent who is con-
cerned with devil worship activi-


ties inthe country.
To guard against abuse, Molo-

ney says parents     should. teach

their children what kind of touch-
es are appropriate and which ones

are not. "You could do this
through dfawing an outline of the
human body and using it to illus-

trate what you are teaching," he


says.

Children, he says, should be


encouraged to tell parents if any


one tries      to abuse     them.




"Caution them against. talking

to strangers or accepting anything


from them," he says, adding that


they should also be advised


against going toby an adult homes
unaccompanied anyone's fami-


ly member or accepting to enter

someone's car without their par-

ents' permission.
