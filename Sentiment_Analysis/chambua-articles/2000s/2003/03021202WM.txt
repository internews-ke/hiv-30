But it has had to make provision for its\r\nsick because in its midst are some 16 orphans who\r\nare infected with the Aids virus.\r\nThe home, which takes in children shunned by\r\nsociety provides shelter and comfort for the homeless.\r\nThere are II children in pre-primary school, 7X\r\nin primary, 13 in secondary and two who are waiting\r\nto join university.\r\nThe nurse manages the sickroom, but the healthcare\r\nburden is heavier than the institution can bear.\r\nLucas Shitekha, the home's chairman, says he\r\nhad thought of sending the HIV positive Aids\r\norphans to a home in Nairobi so they could receive\r\nbetter care, but the same guardians who would not\r\ncare for them refused, arguing that they would not\r\n'want the children buried so far away from ,home. It\r\nis against the local custom.\r\nAs he grapples with the problems at the home,\r\nShitekha fears about the risk of olcler infected children\r\ninfecting the younger, uninfec:ted ones. For\r\nthe ones the home is able to put through school,\r\n, there is hope and promise.\r\nSeth Shikuri, 19, is preparing to join Moi University\r\nto study Electrical and Communication Engineering.\r\nRight now, he is taking an abridging couse\r\nin physics in preparation for the engineering programme.\r\nHis entry to the university is a dream come true\r\nfor Shikuri, whose family could not afford to send\r\nhim to school. He was rescued by the Malaika Children's\r\nHome, which sponsored his education right\r\nthrough secondary school.\r\nJoan Khabakali Mulindi, also from a destitute\r\nfamily, is another beneficiary of the Malaika Children's\r\nHome.\r\nMulindi scored an A-minus in the Kenya Certificate\r\nof Secondary Examination, and is waiting to\r\njoin university for a medicine or.computer science\r\ncourse. She is currently taking computer lessons in\r\nNairobi.\r\nJackline Mutobo recently completed a nursing\r\ncourse at the Mukumu Mission Hospital. She, too,\r\ncomes from the home, which has paid for her education\r\nfrom primary through secondary school and\r\nnursing college. Mutobo offers p&rt-time nursing\r\nservices at the institution while she waits for the\r\noutcome of her interview at the Mukumu Hospital.\r\nEstablished in 199Xto provide shelter, care and\r\neducation for 150 needy children and young people,\r\nthe horne is trying to venture into'unfamiliar territory.\r\nThe initial construction and general maintenance\r\nof the children for the first four years was\r\nfunded by Ushirikiano wa Afrika na Ujerumani, a\r\nGerman charitable organisation with projects in\r\nEast Africa. When the funding ended in December,\r\n2001, and the administrators are now expected to\r\ninvolve the community in sustaining the activities of\r\nthe project.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARRYING EARLY TO RAISE KIN\r\nYOUTHS ORPHANED BY AIDS BEING SUCKED INTO HASTY UNIONS\r\n\r\ncouple,\" says a community worker from the Rural Education and ~\r\nEconomic Enhancement Programme (REEP). I\r\nAlthough the local Luhya community, as well as many others, tra- .'\r\nditionally encouraged early marriage, what is happening in Busia'~, \r\n1 Butula Division is unusual, says REEP coordinator Mary Makokha.\r\n\"'Young people are being forced into marriage after their parents\r\ndie of Aids-related ailments,',' she says.\r\nNational Aids Control Council figures place Busia District among\r\nthe areas worst hit by the scourge. It is estimated that three in every\r\n10 people in the district are infected with the Aids virus.\r\nYoung women between 15 and 25 years are the most vulnerable.\r\nThey lack proper information on Aids and how to avoid contracting\r\nit. Young and old men are constantly trying to lure girls into risky\r\nsexual relations.\r\nPoverty is also fanning the problem. Many people eat just one\r\nmeal in a day, and young women are bein!~pushed out of home to try\r\nto earn 11 living as commerci<'J1sex workers. Their earnings go to support\r\ntheir siblings. Still others choose the route of early marriage\r\nbelieving it is safer, but there are no guarantees.\r\nMakokha's organisation has started a loan scheme to help young\r\npeople set up small businesses. It also runs Aids training sessions on\r\nprevention strategies.\r\nShe sees the initiative as good, but \"there is still work to be done\r\non sensitisation\". Anthony says if someone paid school fees for\r\nhim, he would not mind going back to school even if it meant attending\r\nevening classes .\r\n\r\nAn Association of Media Women in Kenya (Amwik) feature\r\nCONTINUED FROM PAGE 1"}
