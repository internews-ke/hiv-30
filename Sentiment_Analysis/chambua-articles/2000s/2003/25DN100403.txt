  The farmers use two ways of repelling the elephants by planting
the chilies around the fields, and also by burning the chilies as
briquettes.                                                                  i

crops, such as cotton, to chilies, which has brought economic benefits.
One project is already selling "elephant" chili sauce.                       !
   Many farms are laid out rather haphazardly, with no clearly               i
defined edge that elephants can recognise.
It was suggested that a clear path should be created between forest          !
and field, a well-defined border, which is recognized by the elephants
that they are on hostile terrain.
   Then' the farmers plant hot chilies and dense, thorny thickets of         i
sisal around the field perimeter, something elephants do not usually
enjoy trekking through and they tend to avoid unpalatable and
thorny plants. Thorny thickets also keep other animals out of the
field and sisal could also be an other source of income.
Next comes the cash crops, which elephants eat but not particularly          I
enjoy, such as cotton, Then the farmers plant the good stuff, the corn
and bananas, deepest in the field.

   Chilies can be low cost and effective elephant repellents as ele-         t
phants avoid chili plants.
  The farmers use two ways of repelling the elephants by planting
the chilies around the fields, and also by burning the chilies as
briquettes.                                                                  i

   Zimbabwe has cut elephant damage by about three-quarters using
chilies and farmers in Mozambique and Zambia have joined the spicy
bandwagon as well.                                                           i
   They also switched from cultivating previous elephant-prone cash          !
crops, such as cotton, to chilies, which has brought economic benefits.
One project is already selling "elephant" chili sauce.                       !
   Many farms are laid out rather haphazardly, with no clearly               i
defined edge that elephants can recognise.
It was suggested that a clear path should be created between forest          !
and field, a well-defined border, which is recognized by the elephants
that they are on hostile terrain.
   Then' the farmers plant hot chilies and dense, thorny thickets of         i
sisal around the field perimeter, something elephants do not usually
enjoy trekking through and they tend to avoid unpalatable and
thorny plants. Thorny thickets also keep other animals out of the
field and sisal could also be an other source of income.
Next comes the cash crops, which elephants eat but not particularly          I
enjoy, such as cotton, Then the farmers plant the good stuff, the corn
and bananas, deepest in the field.
