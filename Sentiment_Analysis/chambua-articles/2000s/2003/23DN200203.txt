    "If the vaccine works, then the VaxGen story is good news for us, for
    it shows that it is possible to come up with other approaches to tackle
    the Aids epidemic," says Prof)\ dinya Achola, one of the Kenya Aids
    Vaccine Initiative researchers.
    Kavi programme manager Omt Anzala says that even if the vaccine is
    shown to work, other approach,:s should not be abandoned. Sayd Dr
    Anzala: "We can mix the approaches and come up with effective
    vaccines. So other approaches Slould be supported to go ahead."
    Echoing his sentiments, International Aids Vaccine Initiative l:\dvises
    that research has to go on until 1vaccine for all HIV strains is found.
    Fears are, however, rife that if the vaccine is proved effective, there
    will be no cause for countries Iil;e Kenya to celebrate. The HIV strain
    the vaccine targets and possible pricing mechanisms may deny
    deserving cases to access it.
    Because it is designed on the b~sis of HIV strain B - the one
    predominant in Europe - it is :;tillnot proved suitable to Africa,
    where the predominant HIV stJain is C.
    In Kenya and the neighbouring countries, the predominant HIV .
    strain is A. Strain B is also found, but only among an extreme
    minority. Researchers make it dear that the vaccine will have to be
    tested in African countries to Sfe if it can also work here.
    World Health Organisatipns de Jate has equally centred on the
    questions of how vaccine deve!(.ped for ~ne strain ~an ,:"ork on other
    strains. especially those found IIIdevelopmg countnes hke Kenya.
    Similarly, Aids experts say if the vaccine works, the s~all numbe~ of
    Kenyan Aids patient with the ~ strain may n.ot.'ac.cessIt due to pn~es.
    Because VaxGen is a commercIal company, It IShkely to charge high
    prices to recoup its research and development costs.
    Recently, to make it difficult .for developing count~ies to access
    medicine in Europe or Amenca, developed countnes have proposed a
    new rule.
    They want countries that impor. or manufacture ~heaper versions of
     these medicines to do so only under emergency situations.
     This means that, even if one country wants to import the vaccine from
     a cheaper source or to manufac :ure it locally, it has to prove that it is
     facing an emergency situati~n ..                        '.
     Other implications are that Iftte vaccme works and ISusable m
     developing countries, some reSfarcher says donors may become
     unwilling to fund future research in the area. They will perceive the
