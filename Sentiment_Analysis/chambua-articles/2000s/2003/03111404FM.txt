{"text": "\ufeffDaily Nation/ Friday, November 14, 2003\r\nVarsity reaching out to the community\r\nEgerton's Resource Centre giving hope and skills to people living with HIV/Aids\r\n\r\nBy LORRAINE ANYANGO \r\nSociety tends to alienate people infected\r\nwith HIV/Aids, making them feel they\r\nhave nothing to live for. At the Egerton\r\nUniversity in Njoro, a project aimed at\r\ngiving hope and self-respect to people\r\nliving with Aids, while re-integrating'them into\r\nsociety, has been set in motion.\r\nThe university's Community Resource Centre\r\n(CRC) seeks to give an opportunity to people\r\ninfected with HIV within the surrounding community\r\nto engage in productive activities, even as they\r\ndeal with the killer disease.\r\nThe centre is also offers use of its resources to\r\nthose visiting the centre. Lecture theatres are used\r\nfor training and counselling, while young people\r\nfrom the neighbourhood have seized the opportunity\r\nand are using the university's computer laboratories\r\nto acquire IT skills ..\r\nFor now, however, they can only use the facilities\r\non weekends - when the university's regular students\r\nare not using them - as they await the'completion\r\nof a building that will house the community\r\ncentre. The administration of the centre not only\r\nprovides preventive services, but also aims to integrate\r\nAids patients into viable economic and social\r\nroles. There are also innovative programmes for\r\nmothers of Aids patients and orphans.\r\nAlongside the HIV/Aids programmes, the\r\nresource centre also has a cyber cafe. When complete,\r\nthe centre will also operate a shop, a restaurant,\r\nyouth programmes, knitting and dressmaking\r\ncourses, information technology classes and a\r\nhealth clinic.\r\nThe project is jointly funded by Egerton Univer-\r\n\u00b7sity and McCormack Graduate School of Public\r\nPolicy in Boston, US.\r\nThe centre aims at harnessing young people's talents\r\nbefore they drift to self-destructive activities\r\nlike drug abuse or risky sexual behaviour, which is\r\none of the main ways by which HIV/Aids is spread.\r\nIt has so far trained and awarded guidance and\r\ncounselling and computer literacy certificates to 32\r\nyoung people, mainly girls, who are currently working\r\nwith others in clubs and schools in the university's\r\nneighbouihood in anti-HIV/Aids campaigns.\r\nCounselling and IT\r\nRahab Kamau, who went through six months of\r\ntraining in counselling and IT, said the knowledge\r\nthey acquired at the centre had enabled them to\r\nreach and counsel many young people in and out of\r\nschool.\r\nTogether with some of the others who graduated,\r\nshe is now discouraging youths from indulging in\r\ndrugs, thereby reducing their risk of contracting\r\nHlV/Aids.\r\nThe 32 were selected for training after being\r\ninterviewed by the centre's staff, and following consultations\r\nwith local church leaders. They were all\r\nrequired to have finished Form Four, so that a uniform\r\ntraining programme could be designed for\r\nthem.\r\nAlthough lack of finance remains an obstacle to .\r\ntheir aims, says Kamau, some of the skills they had\r\nacquired, particularly computer training, were marketable.\r\nWhen completed, the centre will house diverse\r\nsocial and economic programmes to address the\r\nHIV/Aids in the community, as well as within the\r\nuniversity.\r\nThe dean of the faculty of Arts and Social Science\r\nat the University, Dr Michael Thuo Kuria,\r\nwho. doubled up as the centre's coordinator, said\r\nthat there was need to bridge the gap between the\r\nuniversity's students and the out-of-school youths\r\nliving around the university.\r\nDr Kuria, who died on Monday soon after conducting\r\nthe Nation round the centre, said it was also\r\na meeting place for mothers whose children have\r\ndied of Aids-related complications.\" The programme,\r\nhe added, would give such mothers funds\r\nand a forum where they could share their experiences\r\nand find relief, knowing they were not alone.\r\n'Participants would be equipped with life skills to\r\nhelp them to exercise self-control.and later, even\r\ncounsel others, Kuria said.\r\n\"We shqJl provide each participant with a role\r\nmodel among the professors in order to create a\r\nsense of self-worth and dignity.\r\nKuria said the McCormack School was in the\r\nprocess of setting up a university consortium to\r\ndevelop similar community resource centres in all\r\npublic universities in the country.\r\nAdvisory'board\r\nThe First Lady, Mrs Lucy Kibaki, will chair the\r\nadvisory board of the consortium. Others on the\r\nboard include the chair of the National Aids Control\r\nCouncil, Prof Miriam Were, renowned educationist\r\nDr Eddah Gachukia, and industrialist Dr\r\nManu Chanda ria.\r\nThe multi-faceted programme will target mainly\r\nyoung uninfected people, who, without effective\r\nintervention, could soon get infected.\r\nThe first stage of the project will involve the\r\nestablishement of cyber cafes and computer laboratories\r\nin the universities.\r\nThe universities, in collaboration with local partners,\r\nwill focus their varied expertise on different\r\naspects of HIV/Aids, including medical care, dispensing\r\nof medicine, care giving and the reintegration\r\nof Aids patients into society.\r\nAppropriate technology, including satellite radio,\r\nwill be used as tools for data gathering, and communication\r\nto support the programme.\r\nKljria regretted, though, that the community did\r\nnot like the university students because during\r\nstrikes, the students had destroyed their property.\r\nParicularly hard-hit had been small-scale traders\r\nwhose businesses were barely off the ground.\r\nThe centre, he said, had intentionally been established\r\noutside the university campus to create a situation\r\nwhere members of the public would interact\r\nwith university students and get to know them,\r\nmaking it easier for them to work together\r\nSome Njoro residents living near the campushave\r\npraised the university for taking a positive step\r\ntowards combating Aids at the community level,"}
