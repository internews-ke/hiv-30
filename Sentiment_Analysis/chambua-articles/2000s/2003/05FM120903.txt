joining the European Union next May, Estonia has emerged as one
of Europe's new sex havens.
   The government wants to clean up Tallinn but new anti-sex trade
laws in some West European countries could result in bringing in
more sex tourists to its pretty cobbled back streets.
   "I've heard many foreigners say: 'Oh yes, Estonia, the land of
cheap and beautiful women'," said Kristiina Luht, coordinator of a
Nordic-Baltic project working to stop the trafficking of women.
   Estonia votes on Sunday (September 14) in a referendum on EU
membership. The latest polls show around 70 per cent back EU
entry, crowning a decade of often painful reforms. Estonia also joins
North Atlantic Treaty Organisation next year.
   The country's economic growth since regaining independence from
the Soviet Union in 1991 - a robust 5.8 per cent last year - has
been one of East Europe's success stories, spurred by higher foreign
investment and a surge in tourism ..
   But that growth has been more than matched by the rise in the
capital's "red-light" trade.
Big business, big problem
Sex is big business in Tallinn. The city of just 400,000 has up to 3,000
prostitutes and around 50 brothels ..
   "Prostitution is a .very serious problem for Estonia," said Social
Affairs Minister Marko Pomerants, who has vowed to speed up
efforts to tackle the sex trade.
   Prostitution itself is not illegal in Estonia. Pimping - or profiteer-
ing from selling others' sexual services - is banned.
   Analysts say the problem is not so much lax legislation, but a lack
of enforcement.
   "Tallinn's main asset is availability and price," said 'Mr Maximus',
a frequent Finnish visitor to the capital's brothels.
   Most acknowledge that prostitution is largely a result of poverty,
combined with the lure of fat profits for the pimps.
   Pomerants said he hoped further economic and social integration
with the West would help combat a combination of social depriva-
tion, crime and prostitution.
   Like other ex-communist states in Central and Eastern Europe,
 Estonia's soaraway economy has brought with it a widening social
 gap between the 'haves' and 'have-nots', with regional pockets of
 high unemployment, poverty and despair.
. Attitude
 Luht said many Estonians also had a get-rich-quick attitude, paying
 little heed to moral scruples.
     "H's a strange form of capitalism. You need money to show off,
 but no one asks where it comes from," she said.
     A recent study showed a surge in firms touting for prostitutes. At
 least 30 companies advertised well-paid jobs for women, but told
 undercover researchers they really sought prostitutes.
     "If a girl earns 1,000 kroons ($69.65) a night, she'll be spoiled,"
  said Mr Maximus. "She'll never go back to work in a shop some-
  where for just 2,500 kroons a month."
      He said most prostitutes were from Estonia's big Russian minority,
  often from Soviet-style industrial cities in the northeast which have
  suffered most under the new market economy.
      Men from neighbouring Finl.and account for the majority of
  Tallinn's sex tourists, along with local businessmen. But the city's
  everything-goes reputation'is spread¥!g ..
      Groups of young Britons, celebratil1'gJheir pre-wedding "stag
  nights" are now a common sight on the capital's streets.
  IDV explosion                                -
  As many western countries try to curb, or at least control, prostitu-
  tion - Sweden has banned the buying of sexual services, and Fin-
  land may follow suit - ~stonians .fe.ar. could bring more tourists
                                            this
  to their sex trade, especially after JOlllmgthe El:Pwhen border con-
  trols are phased out.                             ~.
     "We must be careful to avoid becoming a paradise forprostitu-
  tion " Pomerants said, concerned about an explosive spread of HIV /
   Aid~ and the plight of wom.en trapped in t'he sex trade.
     UNAids, the United Nat\~~' Aids agency, recorded 1,474 new
  HIV infections in Estonia in  ztJM -   the highest per capit.;1rate in
  Eastern Europe. Most new cases were related to drug abuse, itself
  closely linked to the sex trade ..                             '
