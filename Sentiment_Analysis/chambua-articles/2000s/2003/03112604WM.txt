PROTECTING CHILDREN AGAINST SEXUAL PREDATORS\r\n\r\nAs Kenyans gear up towards a month of fest,viles. we are reminded that\r\nthere are many children in Kenya who may not be gearing up to the\r\ncelebrations due lo shattered dreams stemnhir)9 from child abuse. There are\r\nthousands of children who are HIV positive as a consequence of abuse and\r\nmany more who have pen-ranent physical and psycttolocaI scars as a\r\nconsequence of the same. Last weel\u00e7 the world marked the Child Rights\r\nWeek with highlights such as the Universal (Jay Against Child Abuse\r\ncelebrated on the eve al the Universal CMd Rights Day (20th Noveri-iber)\r\nthat is intended to renind us of the duty we owe these Vulnerable of our\r\nsociety. Unfolunately, our sensibilities haye been closed to the vulnerability\r\nto abuse Ici our children . We. often thin o) abuse as O\u2019OCurrin\u00f6. td,other\r\nchlklrenand not tooUrs, yel the bad nOw is your child is probably un4eroi\u00f1g\r\nsexual -abuse as you read this-article, 1,asundergOfle abusa. or, lat\u2019\r\nheightened risk of sexuaL-abuse. As Kenya mOiis 16 day\u0161 of activism bn-\u2019\r\ngender-based violence, we are reminded ttat for women and girls, the risk\r\nfactor remains being female. According to statistics frofl the CRADLES\r\nCase Trends Monitor that hghIights trends in cases handled by the CRADLE,\r\napproximately 81% of all cases handled in our legal aid clinic constitute\r\nsexual abuse of girls. 52 % of these consittule defilement of girls below 16\r\nyears. 14% rape of girls between 16 and l7years. 10% abduction of guis\r\nbelow l6years and 5 % involve incest. These ledeed constitute an extremely\r\nsmat percentage of the total number children and won-ten who suffer sexual\r\nabuse daily in our country. Most of these cases go unreported due to various\r\nfactors ildudir,g stigmatization, embarrassment or fear of family break down,\r\nespecially ti the abuser s a relative\r\nThe profite of an abuser Is even more disturbkig and calls for great caution\r\nespecially among parents. We often beeve that the abuser is that gruesome\r\nhorrible, unkempt, ogre-like male stranger who stalks our children ln dark,\r\nunLitaUsys and who secretly monitors the movements of parents and once he\r\nconhmis that they are away from home, mercilessly descends on the children\r\n and wrecks havoc. We are convinced that the abuser must be tt,at st\u00c5stance\r\nabuser who stalks unsuspecting children or wayfays them n thick bushes and\r\nthat once a chance presents itself he pounces on them and sexually abuses\r\nth\u00f5ni. While indeed these aie possible abusers. CRADLE\u2019s experience points\r\nto other unlikely quarters. . \u2018..\r\nHi9h on the list of abusers s that trusted school-teacher, pastor, uncle.\r\nnetghbor, doctor and aunt. In our study, amongst the professionals. teachers\r\nrank highest and amongst those with access to dieldien the trusted neighbor\r\nfollows hOt on the heals. Many of th, abusers are persons the child trust and\r\nthey use the trust as a basis of luring the child. The site of abuse will often be\r\nthe neighbors home, the parents home (especially  house helps and.\r\nrelatives indudlnq fathers). Others wiN abuse children in bushes or thickels\r\nespecially \u00a1f they are not frequented or ll a child uses It laie \u00a1n the evenings,\r\nUnfortunately some children are kiNed subsequent to the sexual abuse\r\nespecially-It they happen to know the abuser and whole communities have to\r\nlive in tear foc themselves and their children If no one \u00bfs apprehended. Cases of\r\nabuse by dpciors in hospitals or private d,nics have also been reported\r\nLllcewise persons holdrg high public offices have been reported to abuse\r\nhouse\u2014helps who In. most cases conceiv\u00e9 and are thrown out to go and bring up\r\nchildren on their own. . , . . .\r\nCases of Incest have increased over the years. This has especially affected\r\ngirls between four and seven years. In a number of cases gills with mild\r\nretardation have been known lo be easy targets. Subsequently mothers who\r\nare accused of rncitlng children against the fathers are forced lo flee for their\r\nlIves. The CRADLE has often been forced to grapple with the problem of not\r\nonly en\u0161uring thai the offender is brought to book but also obtaining shelter toi\r\nthe women arId their children. it has been established that these women have\r\non many occasions ran back to their parents due lo extreme physical violence\r\nby their husbend and it they leave thai, children behind these \u00e1re turned into\r\nsexual objects. Unfortunately some df these girls get infected with sexually\r\ntransmitted diseases including HIV!Aids. This spells double tragedy as the very\r\npoison who is supposed to ensure the protection and welfare of the family\r\ncauses untold suffering. , ,.\r\nExtreme efforts are often made by abusers to conceal the abuse including\r\nbathing the Child, ireats of death O even idlling the chad. Due lo lear ctldren\r\nkeep quiet tor long periods. In some cases they wrIl confine In their friends or\r\nexhibit some behaviors especially withdrawal or retissai to be bathed. By the\r\ntime parents r to learn Of this any Possible evidence thai may lead to a\r\ncnviction wil have been destroyed. Distraught parents have often been\r\nasked whether they suspected sexual abuse of their children especially by\r\ntheir spouses and .e first answer Is usually no. Upon reflection they say that\r\n,i they been keen they wod\u00f0 have been able to interpret certain signs but\r\nby then the damage is already dane. -\r\nThe effects of abuse range from sexually transmitted diseases to extreme\r\ntrauma. Children have exhibited signs of withdrawal, anxiety, aggression,\r\nregressive development behavior and emotional disorders such as\r\ndepression. Most of these effects are lOng-term meaning that the child has to\r\nlive with the abuse for better part of her life. Protection of every child from this\r\nkind of danger then becomes extremely necessary. The passing of the\r\ncriminal amendment Act was a positive move esp\u00e9claijy the raising of the age\r\nof consent to 16 years rernovai of requirement of coation encement\r\nof the sentence for sexual abusers and Inclusion of boys as victims of abuse.\r\nThere is however need for a comprehensive Law that addresses sexual\r\noffences in a more holistic manner. There Is need to expand the offences\r\nagainst morality to indude expaoita of children iii video shows or massage\r\npalours and to include trafficicing and sale m chaciren.
