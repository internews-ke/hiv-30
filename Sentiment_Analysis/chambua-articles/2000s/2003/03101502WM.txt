October 15, 2003 Wednesday\r\n\r\nPROSTITUTES IN SEARCH FOR FUN AND LOVE\r\nCONTINUED FROM PAGE 1\r\nFertile ground ,,-,C\r\nDiscos do indeed 'llppeartO be'a fertile ground to\r\nseek a marrillge partner: That is why David amal-\r\n10,18, goes to Kimwa disco yvery Wedm;sday. He\r\nhopes to meet his future.~ife here. His friend married\r\na girl from Kimwa twp:-years ago and they are\r\ndoing well as a family. The woman is hard-working\r\nand, amalia believes, had had all the fun that life\r\noffers so she will never go back to discos or prostitution.\r\n\"Some of these girls you see here want to settle\r\ndown. They do this out of desperation. They are\r\nlooking for money to help their families. They are\r\nnot born prostitutes.\"\r\nIn his quest for a wife, amalia has had relations\r\nwith six girls in the last year but has yet to find one\r\nwilling to settle down. When he gets one, he says,\r\nhe will not ask her to go for an HIV IAids test\r\nbecause it would mean having one done himself,\r\nyet .he fears knowing his HIV status.\r\n,The management of Octopus Disco has taken a\r\npractical approach to the problem, and has\r\ninstalledcondom dispensers in their washrooms.\r\nThese serves people likelike 17-year-old Triza just\r\nfine: she dashes to the washroom to pick some up\r\nwhen she strikes a deal with a man.Unfortunately,\r\nexperience has shown her that men are not keen on\r\nusing them. \"\r\nAfter an hour of dancing at Donna discotheque,\r\nshe 'once left with a man she had met on the dance\r\nfloor. They agreed that he would p~y her Sh600 for\r\ntwo hours of passion but after lockmg the hotel\r\nroom he discarded the agreement and they had sex\r\nwithout condoms. When he was through, he\r\n~howed her the door and paid her nothing.\r\n~ltl),ough she felt used, she could not report to the\r\n,) police for fear of being arrested.\r\n\"My boyfriend gives me company and these men\r\n-- who talk to me love me. It is good to be loved.\r\nWhen I go out with them, I feel special and I enjoy\r\nthat time immensely.\" -\r\nChristine, who is much better dressed than the\r\nother prostitutes in the vicinity, seeks men out\r\npurely for sexual pleasure. Every Wednesday, she\r\nmoves from one disco to another in search of one.\r\nChristine dropped out of school in Form Two\r\nthree years ago. Her parents, who are financially\r\nstable, set up a beauty and hair salon business for\r\nher in Kisumu town. She makes good money and\r\nhas no responsibilities. She is candid about why she\r\nprostitutes herself:\r\n\"I need a man once in a while. I cOme here to\r\nmeet one, and an extra coin in the ppcket is not\r\nbad. You see, when you are a prostitute you really\r\nget addicted to it.\"\r\nShe hopes one of her clients will make her a marriage\r\nproposal. She has a friend who got a husband\r\nin the same way and is now raising a family.\r\nAnd she will not goto hospital because she\r\nbelieves unprotected sex inevitably leads t<:>HIV\r\ninfection so \"there is no point of going to h?spital\r\nas there is no cure for Aids\".\r\nOther young people engage in prostitutiqn\r\nbecause it gives them a sense of power. They move\r\nfrom one Kisumu disco to another, biding their\r\ntime. As the night wears off and the moneyed men\r\ngo home, ,the prostitutes reduce their charges and .\r\nthen we can afford to take them,\" says the19-year-\r\nold Kevin, a Form Four schoolleaver.\r\nHe frequented discos while in school and got\r\nhooked to prostitutes. He has no girlfriend, saying\r\nthat girls make unrealistic demands on men and\r\ninsist on marriage after just one meeting.\r\n\"It is easier with prostitutes. Girlfriends are so\r\ncomplicated but with a prostitute, you don't have to\r\ntell her your name and it is not important that you\r\nknow hers. No attachment. And that is what I like.\"\r\nLike his friends, Kevin cannot afford to take a\r\nprostitute to a hotel, so they use nearby dark '\r\nstreets. But they have to dodge the guards in the\r\narea. Whil,~they sometimes do use condoms they\r\ndon't seem to be overly concerned about ha~ing\r\nunprotected sex.\r\nWhile many prostitutes have been driven intG\r\nthe trade by poverty and lack of guidance fromthe\r\nadults in their lives, others are forced into the trade\r\nby their mothe~ or guardians. A young girl nar- ,_\r\nrates how her mother took her away from her job .\r\nas a househelp and hooked her up with a prostitute\r\nfrom her home in Kombewa.\r\n\"My mother insists that I give her as much\r\nmoney as 'my trainer' gives her mother. Sometimes\r\nI make up t.oSh2,OOOa night and when I give her\r\nsome of thISmoney,'she is very happy and asks me\r\nto work harder.\"\r\n.~ut sometimes bu~iness is so bad that they are\r\n~llhng to have sexWItha guard for as little as Sh20\r\nJust to get bus fare home.\r\n*,!ames have been changed to conceal identity"}
