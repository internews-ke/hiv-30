The\r\n F              flies- which cau;e sleeping sickness in man and nagana in cattle - breed in the park\r\n                and then invade t leir farms in Lambwe Valley.\r\n                    Claimed Joe Owiro, a Kamoto village farmer: \"Despite many promises in the last\r\nneighbour we have lost 10 high-luality animals to nagana in the last six months.\"\r\n    Four farmers say they have recently lost 22 cows, worth about Sh220,OOO. hey claim that milk\r\n                                                                                       T\r\nproduction has declined and bet f cattle quality is low.\r\n    This is despite the presence of major research institutions, like the International Centre for Insect\r\nPhysiology and Ecology (Icipe), the Kenya Wildlife Service, the Kenya Trypanosomiasis Research\r\nCentre (Ketri) and an African l nity tsetse control programme.\r\n    The farmers say these institutions and the Government are not doing enough to help them.\r\n    However, Ketri director Dr Hathu Ndung'u says farmers are blowing the issue out of proportion,\r\nthat the situation is not as bad a~ they portray it.\r\n    Says Dr Ndung'u: \"In Novenber, we intervened to try to reduce the number of tsetse flies in\r\nLambwe Valley, eventually eralicating them. What we have achieved in the last three months is\r\nencouraging. \"\r\n                                               However, he admits that the situation has not been en-\r\n                                            couraging in the recent past.

In such areas, it trains farmers, communi-\r\nty health workers and other stake IOlders on these technologies.\r\n    The Lambwe farmers, howevl:r, see a motive in their continued suffering and the presence of\r\ntsetse in the region. It is that local research institutions would like the problem to persist as a means\r\nto attract donor funding.\r\n    A few years ago, the European Union gave Kenya Sh680 million for tsetse control. Tsetse is\r\nestimated to affect 60 per cent of t 1e country's rangelands.\r\n    Out of this money, Icipe is said to have got about Sh367 million. The rest went to the Government.\r\n   The Lambwe Valley was supposed to be a recipient. Yet the farmers allege that no tangible\r\nbenefits accrued to them.\r\n   \"We were told tsetse eradication was feasible because this is in an isolated area, but we are yet to\r\nsee serious efforts to do so,\" a farn ler observes.\r\n   \"Contrary to farmers belief,\" Dr Ndung'u ripostes, \"we are determined to introduce new                                                                                                                PholofCorrespondenl\r\n                                                                                                               Officials set up a target for controlling tsetse in Lambwe Valley.
