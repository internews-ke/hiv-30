{"text": "\ufeffDaily Nation I Tuesday, September 23, 2003\r\n\r\nAIDS CENSUS, SAYS WHO\r\n\r\nENVOY ACCUSES WEST OF DOING LITTLE FOR AFRICA\r\n\r\nBy Julius Bosire.\r\nThe UN has blamed the West for failing\r\nto direct enough resources to Africa's\r\nfight against HIV /Aids.\r\nThe UN secretary general's special\r\nenvoy for Africa, Mr Stephen Lewis,\r\nsaid the West was spending a lot of\r\nresources to fight terrorism while they\r\nchannelled little to take care of children\r\norphaned by Aids.\r\n\"Africa needs no instructions from\r\nthe West; Africa needs no arrogance\r\nfrom the West; Africa needs no churlish\r\nlectures from the West. Africans know\r\nHIV/Aids in all its manifestation and\r\nrequirements,\" Mr Lewis said.\r\nHe was addressing the 13th Interna- .\r\ntional Conference on Aids and Sexually\r\nTransmitted Infections in Africil(ICASA)\r\nat the Kenyatta International\r\nConference.\r\nHe said no one in the world had\r\ndeveloped a plan to cope with the millions\r\nof children orphaned by Aids.\r\nThe knowledge and human resources,\r\nhe said, were in Africa, including\r\norganisations of people living with\r\nAids, inspired youth peer counsellors,\r\npolitical and religious leadership, activist\r\nwomen's groups and a sophisticated\r\nstrength on the continent.\r\n\"What is missing are the tools and\r\nsupport to do the job. Provide those to\r\nAfrica, and we can break the back of\r\nthis pandemic,\" Mr Lewis said.\r\nHe said despite all odds, with those\r\norphaned by Aids becoming young parents,\r\nAfricans were determined to save\r\nthe continent. Orphaned children was\r\nthe most vexing issue related to care\r\nbecause there were no enough adults to\r\nlook after the children, he said.\r\nMeanwhile, the World Bank warns\r\nthat HlV/Aids causes greater long-term\r\ndamage to national economies than\r\npreviously assumed.\r\nIts latest research says that by killing\r\nyoung adults, the disease was robbing\r\nthe children of victims of Aids one or\r\nboth parents to love and educate them.\r\nThis undermines the basis of economic\r\ngrowth in the long run.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE URGED TO ESTABLISH DRUG PROCUREMENT CENTER\r\n\r\nBy Nation Team\r\n\r\nThe Government should consider setting\r\nup a procurement centre to enable\r\nAids patients buy cheaper drugs.\r\nA joint report by Medecins sans\r\nFrontieres and the World Health\r\nOrganisation says that Kenya could\r\nexpand access by including Iifeprolonging\r\nAids drugs, commonly\r\nknown as anti-retrovirals, in the existing\r\nnational drug distribution system as\r\nCameroun has done.\r\nSays the report: \"In Kenya, where\r\nmore than 2.2 million are infected by\r\nAids, generic ARVs are used in the\r\nnon-profit sector including MSF\r\nprojects. \"\r\nApproximately 800 people are receiving\r\ntreatment in MSF projects in Homa\r\nBay, Busia and Nairobi where the\r\norganisation, is paying $292 per patient\r\nper year.\r\nHowever, to date, these lower cost\r\nmedicines are only available through\r\nlimited non-profit distribution and are\r\nnot available through a national procurement\r\ncentre, says the report entitled\r\nSurmounting challenges: Procurement\r\nof Anti\u00b7retroviral medicines in low\r\nand middle\u00b7 income countries.\r\nLast week, the Government launched\r\na national programme to provide drugs\r\nto patients in public hospitals.\r\nThe programme, under which the\r\nGovernment has set aside Sh150 million,\r\nwill initially benefit 6,000 patients.\r\nMs Sophie-Marie Scouflaire, the lead\r\nauthor of the MSFIWHO report says:\r\n\"In the 10 countries profiled in the\r\nreport it has been possible to supply\r\nlow cost quality ARVs to MSF projects\r\nbut in many cases lack of a government\r\nprocurement strategy has meant that .\r\nMSF had set-up supply channels\r\nin-country.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST LADIES DEMAND LAWS TO CURB VIRUS\r\n\r\nAfrican First Ladies yesterday\r\nchallenged governments to\r\nenact laws which will protect\r\ncouples from philandering\r\npartners.\r\nAddressing a satellite conference on\r\nthe HIV/Aids pandemic, the First\r\nLadies of Uganda, Guinea, Rwanda\r\nand Kenya expressed concern that\r\nwomen, particularly in the rural areas,\r\nwere more vulnerable to their unfaithful\r\npartners who infected them with\r\nsexually transmitted diseases and the\r\nAids virus.\r\nThrough their Organisation of African\r\nFirst Ladies Against HIV/Aids (OAFLA),\r\nthe First Ladies called on women\r\nlawyers to come up with a law to protect\r\nwomen and children from unfaithful\r\nhusbands who infect their wives\r\nwith the Aids virus.\r\n\"We must stop this. Even God has\r\nmade adultery a sin to prevent a\r\nspouse from infecting\r\ntheir partner,\" said\r\nUganda's Janet Museveni.\r\nThe First Ladies said it\r\nwas time Africans recognised\r\nthe enormity of the\r\nproblem, accept its magnitude\r\nand surmount the\r\nmany difficulties ahead in combating\r\nits spread.\r\nThey said the first step towards combating\r\nthe disease's spread was by\r\nfrankly talking about unprotected and\r\nirresponsible sex, its impact, the HIV/\r\nAids disease and other issues regarded\r\nby most African communities as taboo.\r\n\"Now is the time to talk about HIVI\r\nAids at the family table, at the pulpit,\r\nin the media and at all gatherings\r\nincluding funerals and weddings. We\r\nmust curb the spread of the pandemic,\"\r\nsaid Mrs Lucy Kibaki.\r\nMrs Kibaki was optimistic that even\r\nwith limited resources, the continent\r\ncould overcome the devastation of the\r\nAids pandemic.\r\n\"People, especially women and girls,\r\nshould have the freedom, the power\r\nand the knowledge to make decisions\r\nabout their health,\" she said.\r\nThe conference, whose theme is Empowering\r\ngirls and women in the fight\r\nagainst HlVlAids, noted that while\r\neveryone was vulnerable to getting\r\nAids, the poor were more at risk.\r\n\"Now is the time for every government\r\nin Africa to integrate anti-retrovirals in\r\ntherapies to prolong lives of the infected.\r\nThat is the only way that infected\r\nparents can live long enough to take\r\ncare of their children,\" the First Ladies\r\nsaid.\r\nMrs Museveni challenged other African\r\ncountries to follow the Ugandan\r\nexample where the government\r\nacknowledged the threat posed by the\r\ndisease early enough and took measures\r\nto curb its spread.\r\n\"We moved from fear, panic and\r\ndenial to commitment and action and\r\nnow to renewed commitment,\" MIS\r\nMuseveni told delegates at the conference\r\nwhich ends today.\r\nIt happened at a time when her country\r\nwas least prepared. Uganda had\r\njust come out of a protracted civil war\r\nand the country's main objective was\r\nrecq~truction and rebuilding the\r\ncountry which was in a shambles.\r\n\"We were less p't~ared when it hit us.\r\n&uHwo decades later\r\nHIV/Aids is contained\r\n<111 Uganda.\"\r\nWith a nati\r\nIence rateq\r\ncent a~d 11~\r\ncent in other .~\r\nUganda has th\u20ac eS1~'\"\r\nincidence of Aids in\r\nsub-Saharan Africa.\r\n\"This gives us hope that the scourge\r\ncan be contained.\"\r\nUganda used all available platforms to\r\nraise the alarm on HIV/Aids and the\r\nsensitisation in the country is 100 per\r\ncent. First sex encounter has risen\r\nfrom age 14 to 18, said Mrs Museveni.\r\n\"Everyone must be told that they and\r\nonly they can change their behaviour\r\nand practice in the face of Aids and\r\ndeath,\" she said.\r\nRwanda's First Lady Jeannette Kagame\r\nsaid OAFLA's role was to catalyse\r\nactions geared towards treatment\r\nof opportunistic diseases and to work\r\nWith other agencies such as the United\r\nNations to contain the disease.\r\n\"We know what needs to be done but\r\nthere is need for mobilisation to support\r\nprogrammes to fight Aids.\"\r\nOther countries like Cameroon, Zambia,\r\nBenin, South Africa and Burkina\r\nFaso sent representatives. Later, the\r\nFirst Ladies held a fundraising dinner\r\nto advance their campaign for effective\r\n:.s~rategies to eradicate stigma and dis-.\r\nCtimination of people infected\u00b7ana .\r\naffected by HIVI Aids."}
