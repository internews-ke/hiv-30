every other emotion that could be brought out.
  It has also been a fortnight when Kenyans, united in grief,
put aside their differences, suspended the heated political
arguments, to honour a man who stood out for moderation
and reconciliation; a man whose very lifestyle recognised that
there is a time for work and a time for play; that the skuldug-
gery of politics must not occupy our every waking moment.
  The best tribute we can give Mr Wamalwa, then, is to is
borrow some of the admirable traits he displayed in his publ~c
career. Foremost, as we say the final farewell this afternoon,
we must conduct ourselves with dignity and sobriety.
  Mourn, we will, each in his or her own way and to his or her
heart's content. But we must not do so in a fashion that,dis-
rupts the proceedings of a sombre occasion, that might lead to
shoving, pushing, stampeding or a general breakdown of law
and order.
We owe it to Mike
We must be on our best behaviour - not just because the eyes of the
world will be on us, but because we owe"it to Mike - as l\ll called him
irrespective of social status -, to bid him adieu in a fashion that he
would have been proud of.
   That is for today. In the long term - in the coming days, weeks,                                              WAR ON KILLER DISEASES.                               GITURA MWAURA
