{"text": "\ufeffDaily Nation/ May 28, 2003\r\n\r\nA BOOK OF MEMORIES TO HELP CHILDREN COPE WITH DEATH\r\nBy PHILIP MWANIKI\r\nFamily life, for 50-year-old Catherine\r\nWangui, has been a series of divorces and\r\nmarriage break-ups.\r\n\"I never got to know my grandfather\r\nafter he divorced my grandmother. My parents,\r\ntoo, divorced when I was in teenage; and now I\r\nam also separated from my husband ..\r\n\"If my children were to be left without me, they\r\nwouldn't have anyone to talk to,:' she says. Wangui\r\nworries about the memories her children will\r\nhave of their family. She is HIV positive, and agonizes\r\nabout leaving them alone.\r\n\"In the book I am preparing, I will include\r\ninformation about all the male parents in the\r\nextended family. The children never came to\r\nknow them. The break-ups left children being\r\nraised only by their mothers:' she says.\r\nWangui's is not just a record of family memories.\r\nIt is a scrap book containing details about her\r\nwishes, her belongings and what should happen to\r\nthem, and how she would like her children to live\r\nwhen she is no longer with them.\r\nAnd she is not alone in preparing a record of\r\nher life. Many infected parents are being trained\r\nto prepare their children for eventual death.\r\nSince her parents disclosed their HIV status to\r\nher, Mercy Mukami':' has been worrying endlessly.\r\nShe is the eldest in her family, and is dogged by\r\nthe fear of what her relatives might do once her\r\nparents die.\r\nThe Memory Book initiative, launched by the .\r\nSociety of Women and Aids in Kenya (Swak),\r\nensures that parents leave their children with\r\ninformation on their family history. Parents are\r\nshown how to prepare the book, and to include\r\ninformation about all their property and how they\r\nwould like their children to use it in their absence.\r\n\"In the book, the children can feel their parents'\r\npresence, th.ereby reducing the trauma that\r\ncomes with being orphaned,\" says Mercy Wahome,\r\nSwak's assistant coordinator.\r\nThe Memory Book is produced in loose sheets\r\nof paper, each with a different heading - such as,\r\n\"My favourite memories for you and my hopes for\r\nyour future.\"\r\nPhotographs and other items that carry unique\r\nmemories - like happy moments together and\r\nengagement rings - can be put aside and stories\r\nabout them included in the book.\r\nPeople are encouraged to make photostat copies\r\nof the book to make sure that not just a few\r\npeople have access to it.\r\n\"The project enables children orphaned by\r\nAids to live with positive memories of their parents,\"\r\nsays Wahome.\r\nThe idea of the Memory Book originated in the\r\nUnited Kingdom, as a tool to help the children of\r\ncancer patients cope with the death of their parents.\r\n\"This idea was adopted for use by people\r\ninfected by HIV/Aids and is quickly gaining\r\nmomentum,\" Wahome says.\r\nIn Uganda the National Community of Women\r\nLiving with HIV/Aids launched the initiative in\r\nllJlJ5.The organisation's chairperson, Scovia\r\nKasolo, says the initiative \"has since registered\r\nmassive success with the children orphaned by\r\nAids in the country\".\r\nKaso!o is also the lead trainer of the Memory\r\nBook initiative in Kenya and Uganda. Kenyans\r\nfirst got involved in the Memory Book project at\r\nthe beginning of 200\\.\r\nAmerican charities such as USAid, through the\r\n. Family Health International (FHI), and the Bill\r\nand Melinda Gates Foundation, finance the\r\nproject through the Hope for the African Child\r\nInitiative.\r\nChildren get to be equipped with information\r\nand knowledge they can fall back on and help\r\nthem seek assistance from relatives, or appeal to\r\nthe law in case of abuse or being disinherited.\r\n\"It is necessary for parents since they don't\r\nknow what will become of their children after\r\ntheir death:' Wahome says.\r\nTabitha Gathungu, who is Swak's secretary in\r\nCentral Province, says some relatives have vehemently\r\nprotested against the idea of the memory\r\nbook, believing it to be a harbinger of death.\r\nSimon Wamai, 32, says: \"It gives one a feeling\r\nthat he is writing a death wish, making him realise\r\nthat he is dying and that is what creates discomfort.\"\r\nWamai, who has been trained under the initiative,\r\nsays what keeps him and other patients\r\ngoing is the fact that it is to benefit their children.\r\nSo far, 30() HIV-positive people from all the\r\ncountry's eight provinces have been trained on\r\nhow to prepare a memory book.\r\n\"The training is to enable them to write their\r\nown memory books, with technical support from\r\nthe national secretariat,\" says Swak official Susan\r\nNdung'u.\r\n\"We hope that the Memory Book will soon be a\r\ncommon feature with families infected and\r\naffected by the pandemic,\" she adds.\r\nThe initiative also hopes to ease the burden\r\nparents feel when they have to disclose their positive\r\nHIV status to the children, and prepare them\r\nand their children for permanent separation.\r\nParents and children communicate better, says\r\nWahome, hence enabling them to prepare for\r\ndeath.\r\nTrainers cite sensitising one's relatives to assist\r\nin writing the book as one of the most difficult\r\nissues.\r\nIn training, parents are taught about the various\r\nissues they can cover in the book, like the family\r\nhistory and aspirations.\r\n\"The parents, too, get to understand the importance\r\nof making a valid will after being taught\r\nhow to go ahout it,\" says Wahome.\r\n\"Name has heen changed 1oproieci idel1lily"}
