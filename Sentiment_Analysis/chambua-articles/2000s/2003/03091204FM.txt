{"text": "\ufeffDaily Nation/ Friday, September 12, 2003\r\nChildren pour out their\r\nheartsin Aids messages\r\n\r\nBY PHILO IKONYA\r\nAdults write carefully, vaguely and guardedly\r\nwhen their turn comes to sign the community\r\nmessages book on Aids at Nairobi's St\r\nAndrew's Presbyterean Church.\r\nBut not so the children.\r\nWhen they begin to express themselves, Information\r\nand Tourism Minister Raphael Tuju's \"Lets\r\nfight back Aids so that Aids can be beaten!\" or the\r\ndistant \"God bless you\" do not hold a candle to\r\nhow the children pour out their feelings on Aids.\r\n\"God cares for those who are six [sick],:' writes a\r\nsix year-old boy who is HIV positive. There is a\r\nqueue of child~en behind him eager to put their\r\nfeelings and thoughts to paper.\r\n\"Auntie, now I know you wiUlive longer,\" writes\r\na little girl. All her hope is pegged on access to care\r\nthat is a part of fighting the virus. Other little ones\r\nwrite of how they miss people the\u00a5 have lost to\r\nAids ..\r\nIn their little doodly handwritings, their emotions\r\npour out in all sincerity. Their thoughts so humane,\r\ntheir hope so unfailing, their fears too strong to be\r\ndismissed.\r\nSeven-year-old Karoli Njoroge writes three different\r\nmessages. \"Take care!\" then, \"Aids is a killer\r\n'deseas' [sic], and after a while,'returned to pen:\r\n\"Aids is a very bad deseases [sic].\"\r\nIt is Sunday at St Andrew's Church, and worshippers\r\nare queuing to put their messages and names\r\ndown. These messages will be pasted on a quilt and\r\nbe used to make a tapestry to be hung on the walls\r\nof the Kenyatta International Conference Centre\r\nduring the 13th International Conference on HIV/\r\nAids and Sexually Transmitted Infections in Africa.\r\nThe quilt will be read by over 7,000 delegates\r\nwho will be meeting to discU\u00a3.~\"A.=~s to Care\".\r\nMessages will be taken down in many otherplaces around the country.\r\nKeen to read\r\nThere is joy in knowing that children can spontaneously\r\nwrite down their fears and be keen to read.\r\nFor many of the children at the church, it was\r\nimportant for them to know how their agemates\r\ncame to be infected if, as one put it, \"they do not do\r\nsex because they are too young\" ..\r\nExplaining that children can be infected in their\r\nmother's wombs or at birth does not always quiet\r\nanxieties. Did the mother get the doctor's permission\r\nto have him as a baby who did not get Aids?\r\nAnother concludes that he has Aids because a\r\nwoman living with the disease gave him a kiss on\r\nthe cheek.\r\nAnswering the children's questions requires\r\npatience, honesty and courage, but it is a job that\r\nmust be done as part of the growth of dialogue on\r\nHIV /Aids.\r\nTuju says people should be encouraged to take\r\nthe HIV test, and challenges the church to do more\r\nin breaking the silence over Aids.\r\nSociety needs to embrace those infected as a way\r\nof breaking the stigma with which people living\r\nwith Aids are treated.\r\n. When he speaks again, Tuju talks of hope and\r\nwindows of opportunity as Kenyans get informed\r\nabout Aids. That there are discordant couples -\r\nonly one partner is infected - and these are in the\r\nrange of 40 per cent of all couples.\r\nThe Reverend George Wanjau, a former moderator\r\nof the Presbyterean Chruch, writes, \"God\r\ncares, we care!\" It echoes what Pastor phYllis\r\nOchillo, and many others, had asked worshippers to\r\ndo: take Aids personally and care for everyone\r\naffected and infected.\r\nAids has proved just how difficult it is to influence\r\nhuman sexual behaviour this way or that. It\r\nhas demonstrated how much human beings are\r\ncreatures of habit. But HIY /Aids has also taught,\r\nthe world the value of putting up a brave fight.\r\nHumanity's hope lies in information and action.\r\nIn spite of the sad reality that faces mankind, in\r\nspite of so many deaths, so many children getting\r\norphaned, so many suffering without medication, so\r\nmany being afraid of testing and others testing,\r\nAids is a challenge that is being faced head-on.\r\nSome of the messages on the quilt demonstrate\r\njust how people are doing that: \"Abstinence could\r\nsave you, but information could save a friend. Get\r\ninformation\"; \"Aids is not a disease of the poor\";\r\n\"Access to care is possible\"; \"People with Aids can\r\nlive long and productive lives\"; \" Lets fight Aids,\r\nnot people living with Aids.\"\r\nMost of these short messages will be used to\r\nmake banners that will be displayed along the\r\nstreets of Nairobi during the Icasa conference.\r\n\r\nFIRST LADIES COMING TO TOWN FOR A MAJOR MEETING\r\nSome of the seven first lad.ies expected at a\r\nmajor Aids meeting in Nairobi will don\r\ntracksuits on September 20 to run as a show\r\nof solidarity with girls and women ravaged by the\r\ndisease .\r\nAlready, four wives of Africanheads6fstate\r\nhave confirmed attendance of the Qrganisation of\r\nFirst Ladies Against Aids meeting in Nairobi and\r\nwill take part in activities during the International .\r\nConference on Aids and Sexually Transmitted .\r\nInfections in Africa (Icasa) at the Kenyatta International\r\nConference Centre (KICC). The first ladies'\r\nparticipation in the meeting is being seen as giving\r\nHIY/Aids a high political profile.\r\nKenya's First Lady Lucy Kibaki, who has invited\r\nthe other first ladies, registered for the run on Monday.\r\nThe run is one of the major curtain-raisers to\r\nthe Icasa conference, which w~l bring together over\r\n7,000 delegatedrom Africa and the rest of the\r\nworld.\r\nMrs'Kibaki and first ladies from Uganda, Gabon\r\nand Rwanda are among those who have confirmed~\r\nattendance, and are expected to perform certain\r\nactivities during the meeting. It will be the first time\r\nthat Kenya is hosting first ladies in such large num~\r\nbers.\r\nDuring the ICAs1\\. meeting, the first ladies are\r\nexpected to hold a two-day Organisation of First\r\nladies Against Aids meeting.\r\nICASA is one the biggest events to ever happen\r\nin recent tjmes in Kenya, and official sources said\r\nsecurity and other arrangements for the first.iadies\r\nwere complete.\r\nPresident Mwai Kibaki, who is the patron of the\r\nconference, has appoint~dJhree government minis\"\r\nters - lIealth's Charity Ngilu,1'0urism's Raphael\r\nTuju, and National SecuritY\"'3Chris Murungaru -\r\nto ensure that its success \u2022.\r\nThe conference, held every two years, is expected\r\nto outline strategic priorities, charting the way for- .\r\nward onbow to tackle HIY/Aids from an African\r\nviewpoint.\r\nIt brings together top African al!d other world\r\nscientists, social and political leaders as well as communities\r\nto share their experiences'imd current'\r\ntrends in the management of HIY/Aids and STIs.\r\nTwo years ago, the 12th Icasa meeting was held in\r\nOuagadougou, Burkina Faso. The theme of the\r\nconference was 'The Communities Commit Themselves'.\r\nStarted in 1987 to address HIY/Aids and STIs\r\nand providing solutionsJrom an African perspective,\r\nIcasa is one the most highly regarded events in\r\nthe world.\r\nThe Nairobi meeting, which will be held between\r\nSeptember 21 and 26, is the thirteenth. Its theme is\r\n'Care to Access: Challenges.'\r\nAccess to antiretroviral drugs, prevention of\r\nmother-to~child transmission of HIY, opportunistic\r\ninfections, and Aids vaccine development are some\r\nof the major issues expected to feature.\r\nAway from the scientific arguments, the conferenCe\r\nhas also set into motion a flurry of other activities.\r\nOver 150ushers are being recruited to welcome\r\nthe guests. An estimated 600 security personnel are\r\nearmarked for deployment to ensure security\r\naround the conference and in areas where the delegates\r\nwill stay.\r\nAnd for KICC, the sun has never shone as bright\r\nas now. Everything is being spruced up: walls are\r\ngleaming with new paints, the lighting system is\r\nunder repair, and standby generators are being\r\ninstalled. At the end of it all, the government will\r\nhave spent over ShIGOmillion.\r\n\r\nAN AWC FEATURE"}
