The problem is how to raise the resources\r\nrequired for the task. For the truth is that the Government\r\nhas no chance of raising even half the money needed.\r\n   Yesterday, President Kibaki estimated at Sh203 billion the\r\nlevel of investment required in three years. This figure is\r\nmore than what the Kenya Revenue Authority collects in                                                                             BETWEEN US 0 KWAMCHETSI MAKOKHA\r\ntaxes every year.\r\n   Where then will the money come from?
