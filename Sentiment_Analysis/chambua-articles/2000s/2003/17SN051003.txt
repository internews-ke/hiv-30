                                         Dr Frank said: "It's not just lions. Populations
                                         of all African predators are plummeting."
                                             He said the wild dog population had fallen

                                         blissfully unaware that these large carnivores

                                          has got rifles and poisons."
                                              He said his study in the Laikipia region had

                                           locals to earn money from the predators. He
                                           suggested that this could be achieved either
                                           through tourism or through sport hunting.
