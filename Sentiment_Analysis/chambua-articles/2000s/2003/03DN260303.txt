WAR ON SCOURGE
ANGLICANS PLAN NEW AIDS CURRICULUM

By Nation reporter

The Anglican Church will introduce
a new Aids syllabus in its
theological schools and colleges
as part of the campaign against the
scourge.
The church also pledged to intensify a
campaign to remove the stigma
associated with Aids and to
convince its followers that the
disease was not a punishment
from God.
Anglican bishops, pastors and
lay members gathered at the
Limuru Conference Centre
yesterday to work out ways of
fighting Aids.
It is part of the campaign
launched on Sunday by President
Kibaki involving religious organisations
in drawing up plans to combat the '
scourge.
The ACK would, at the same time, train
church workers on caring for anq supporting
the infected.
The plan was presented by Archbishop
Benjamin Nzimbi to HeiIlth minister
Charity Ngilu.
"The Church has the moral responsibility
to provide accurate information and
allow individuals to make informed
choices on testing and relationships,"
Archbishop Nzimbi said.
The minister was for the second day listening
to views from religious organisations
on how to contain Aids.
On Monday, the Catholic
Church presented its views and
called for chastity among the
unmarried and faithfulness
among the married.
In its plan, the Anglican
Church says it will strengthen
its education departments and
a bursary scheme for children
orphaned by Aids.
The archbishop said the
Church would integrate Aids
activities in all pastoral work and collab·
orate with others to curb the spread of
the disease.
The Church would also advocate morality,
he said.
"The community, and the Church in particular;
has a commitment tpeliminat~
this epidemic. We haveto fight our way
out and the time is nowflle said.
Those who attended thet>ne-day meeting
accused donors of failing to invest in
developing an Aids vaccine.
They sought to know why such organisations,
which gave a lot of money to fight
Aids, could not use part of it on vaccine
research.
Answering a question, Health permanent
secretary Julius Meme said: "We
are also perplexed why large sums of
money are given for the fight against the
scourge instead of developiirg a vaccine."
Prof Meme said vaccine development
would take less than 15 per cent of what
was being spent in the fight against the
disease.
