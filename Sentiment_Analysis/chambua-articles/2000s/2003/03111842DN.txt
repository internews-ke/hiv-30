This is an HIV/AIDS initiative to promote a positive approach to the fight against HIV/AIDS, in\r\n       support of the National HIV/AIDS Communication Strategy implementation.\r\n       In this campaign, the Minis.try of Health targets young people aged 12-25, HIV free (Negative) Kenyan\r\n       population and people already living with the virus. The campaign is geared towards initiating an integrated\r\n       range of activities to facilitate HIV/AIDS, prevention, care and support across all provinces in the republic of\r\n       Kenya.                          I\r\n       The Ministry currently provi~es a wide range of services such as Voluntary counselling and testing (VCT),\r\n       prevention of parent to child transmission (PTCT), condom programmes, behaviour change communication,\r\n       treatment for sexually transmitted and opportunistic infections, blood safety, among others.\r\n       This campaign is critical to the delivery of these services as it will provide new information on the risks of\r\n       HIV/AIDS, and increase knowledge and motivate target groups to abstain from sex, live more positively with\r\n       HIV/AIDS, actively engage in risk reduction behaviours and efforts to remain HIV negative. The campaign\r\n       will also aim to expand on issues related to treatment, care and support of people living with HIV/AIDS, and\r\n       people adversely affected by the impact of the pandemic.                                         '\r\n        It is envisaged that the campaign will utilise a multidimensional approach, incorporating electronic, print\r\n        media activities. The agenc~ will be expected to assist the ministry in mobilising resources for an additional\r\n        range of activities in parthership with private sector, philanthropists, NGO'S and community based\r\n        organisations for scaling up:an integration into the national campaign.\r\n       Interested agencies may submit EOI documentation for the provision of services to the\u00b7 National AIDS &\r\n       Sexually Transmitted Infections Programmes (NASCOP) for the services.
