      How 'Osama'

                       fter almost a decad: of wishing the problem away, scientists have ad-

       A                  Sh7-billion maize losses annually.
                             "The pest has ddied all control measures," Dr Christopher Ngich-
                          abe senior researcher at the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute
         Speaking to Agriculture and Livestock Development Minister Kipruto arap Kirwa as
      he toured Kari, Dr Ngichabe said the best hope was a pest-resistant crop the centre was
      busy developing.
         But, he said, it would take several years before the variety can be readily available to
      farmers countrywide.
          The Larger Grain Borer (A threat '0 I:ood Security 2003), another Kari study, is even
      more cautious: "There are indications that some recommended insecticidal dusts for
      mixing with shelled maize are no long:r as effective as they used to be."
          "This is the most dangerous of all ~,tored grain pests," C.M. Ngatia, one of the report's
      authors, warns. According to him, tbe pest causes up to 40-per cent maize and 73-per
                                                   cent cassava losses in three to six months.

       Some farmers have                           pest," says 1. N. Mbugua, another co-author of
                                                   the report.

                                                   even by livestock."
                                                      Efforts at biological methods - including a
       natural predator - to control LGB bave not made any significant impact.
           Dr Francis Nang'ayo, Kari's Prin~ipal Research Officer, introduced the predator in
       parts of Kiboko and Taveta but found that it worked well only at mild - that is, high -
       altitudes. Kenyans thus do not benefit from such an intervention.
           Mr Mbugua adds: "The loss callied by LGB is compound. The pest eats virtually
       everything, wooden storage structures and plastics not spared."                                                                                                                                          Photo/Reuters
           The officials add that, at the moment, the extent of the spread of the LGB is not well               " This photo won the first prize in the nature and environment stories category in the World
