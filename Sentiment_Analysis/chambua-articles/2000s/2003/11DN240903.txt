 easy access

     By NATION Correspondent
 More than 200 people infected ,with
 Aids yesterday convened a "people's
 tribunal" and passed a guilty verdict
 against the Government and multina-
 tional pharmaceutical companies.
    They accused the Government of
 paying lip-service to the provision of
 life-prolonging Aids drugs, commonly
 known as anti-retrovirals, to the 250,000
 infected people who urgently require
 them.
    They said although they welcomed
 last week's Government move to begin
 treatment of 6,000 patients in public
 hospitals soon, it was yet to design and
 implement a national ARV treatment
 plan.
    Participants at the tribunal, held out-
 side the Kenyatta International Confer-
 ence Centre, also found transnational
 pharmaceutical companies guilty for
 being "profit-driven" and failing to
 make ARVs available to poor people.
    Employers, families and society were                                                                                                                                                              Photo/FredrickOnyango'
