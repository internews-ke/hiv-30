FRIGHTENING STATISTICS RELATING TO HIV/AIDS

By Mungai Kihanya

Let's talk about sex ... and Aids.
. There are 45 million people living with
HIV in the world today. A year ago, the
number was 40 million. That gives an increase of
five million new victims in one year. In other
words, 30 more people will contract the virus by
the time you finish reading this article.
In Kenya, about 3 million people are HIVpositive.
Last year there were 500,000 new infections.
Every day, 800 people die from Aids-related
illnesses. One Kenyan will die of Aids by the time
you are through with this article ... and two more
will contract HIV!
Now, there are about 20 million Kenyans aged
between 15 and 49 years. Out of these, three million
are HIV positive, leaving only 17 million that
are negative.
Now, the number of new infections grows exponentially.-
That is, the greater the number of HIVpositive
people, the greater the rate of increase.
This trend is made clear by these figures:
• In 2002, the number of HIV positive Kenyans
increased by 500,000 from 2.5 million to 3 million.
• In 2003, the figure will rise by 600,000 to 3.1
million. Next year, the increment will be 720,000
making a total of 3.8 million HIV carriers.
• The year. 2005 will see 860,000 new infections
bringing the total to 4.6 million.
If the trend continues, all adults in Kenya will be
HIV positive at the end of 2013. And, since children
of HIV positive mothers are also infected, it is
easy to see that all Kenyans, young and old, will be
HIV positive in the next 10 years.
These numbers are frightening ... but there is
more:
The World Health Organisation estimates that
over 90 per cent of adult HIV case~ in developing
countries contract the virus through heterosexual
contact. In Kenya, this means that at least 400,000
people got the virus from unprotected sex last year.
Now, how easily does one get the virus through
unprotected sex?
Researchers from Erusmus University in Rotterdam,
Netherlands, and Princeton University in the
U~~ have found that the probability of HIV transmISSIon
through unprotected heterosexual intercourse
varies from 0.1 per cent to 4 per cent.
During t~e first 10 weeks after contracting HIV,
the probabIlIty that the carrier will transmit the
virus to a heterosexual partner is 4 per cent (man
to woman) and 2 per cent (woman to man). After
this phase, the body will develop some resistance
that brings down the transmission probabilities to
0.2 per cent and 0.1 per cent respectively.
Le~ us put these figures in perspective: Working
the hIgher transmission probability of 4 per cent, it
turns ,?ut. that if 100 HIV -positive men were to
engage in unprotected sex with 100 HIV-negative
women, four of the women would contract the
:virus..
So far this year, over 500,000 Kenyans have contracted
.J-flV through unprotected sex. Using the
probabIlIty of 4 per cent, it is easy t6 work out the
total number of unprotected sexual contacts with
HIV-positive partners in the country. This is (100/
4) x 500,000 = 12.5 million.
