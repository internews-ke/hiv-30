   Tuberculosis remain a major public
health problem despite it being preventable,
treatable and curable.
   It remains the largest killer of those
infected with HIV. TB and HIV form a lethal
combination, each speeding the other’s
progress. HIV weakens the immune system.
   Someone who is HIV-positive and infected
with TB bacilli is many times more likely to
become sick with TB than someone infected
with TB bacilli who is HIV-negative.
