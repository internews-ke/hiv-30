By JEFF OTIENO
An average of eight soldiers die of
Aids every week, the Department
of Defence said yesterday.
The military had suffered heavily
since the first diagnosis of th. disease in
Kenya in 1984. said the Vice Chief of General
Staff, Lieutenant General Koech.
“The military must be open and light the dis
ease that is consuming six lo eight soldiers
every week,” said the officer, during the
launch of an Aids Control Unit at the Depart-
ment of Defence headquarters in Nairobi.
n The Unit, formed with the help of the
National Aids Control Council, is expected to
co-ordinate Aids-related activitieS in the
department.
Officers Musa Oturo and Owiso Mbajah. who
are l-11V positive, recounted to the partici
pants their suffering since they tested posi
tive.
They urged the government to make anti
reiroviral drugs available for victims, and told
fellow soldiers to avoid irresponsible sex and
visit voluntary counselling centres for testing.
Lt-General Koech said the work øf soldiers
put them at risk of cohtracting the disease. ,
“Our soldiers have fought in Ioreigñ lands
like East Timor and Sierra Leone making
them vulnerable lo the disease,” he added.
He also singled out peer pressure among sol
diers as a factor leading to the high infectiOn
rate.
The National Aids Control Council’s Public
Sector Manager, Mr Joshua Ng’clu. said
armed forces worldwide were among the
most vulnerable groups to the disease.
“‘luis is because the pomlatiofl of the forces
is youthful sexually active and often away
from home.” said Mr Ng’elu.
