The group is currently\r\n     performing in Massachusetts. According to Harry Mwaurah, the\r\n     Milele information officer, they will have covered 23 states by the\r\n     end of the month. Milele has been well received wherever they have\r\n.1   performed, leaving behind many new fans ..\r\n  ;     \"And we have seen the success of our evangelising efforts when\r\n   \" many young people have committed their lives to waiting for the\r\n     partner that God has set aside for them,\" says Kanji Mbugua, who\r\n     spoke to Lifestyle recently when the group was on holiday in Kenya.\r\n        The other members of Milele are Kaima Mwati and Christian\r\n     Kiarie Mungai.\r\n        Just like their debut album, Forever, Level Up has catchy beats and\r\n     is worth listening to from start to finish.\r\n        \"It is an eclectic musical buffet that testifies the uniqueness of our\r\n     flavoured ministry,\" says Kanji.\r\n        The album, which is being distributed by No Doubt Records (a\r\n     Christian division of EMI), has 15 tracks. The songs are Journey,\r\n   Afrique, Love You Lord, Wodee, Live Again, Turn it Around, For\r\n   You, Faya, and Open Your Eyes.\r\n     Others are Runnin', Coming Home, Set Free, Ngai, and A New                                                                                                                                      HP recommencIs MiclOsoff Windows- XP Professional for Business.\r\n   Day. The song, Open Your Eyes, pleads with youth to lead morally\r\n   upright lives and warns that the HIV pandemic could wipe out the\r\n   entire youth population if they refuse to open their eyes.\r\n   Prepare the listener\r\n   And, For You has a straight-up gospel message laid into syncho-\r\n   beats. It is meant to prepare the listener psychologically to have\r\n   dialogue with God. The songs, Set Free and Ngai (Kikuyu for God),\r\n   delve into man's poor relations with God. They, however, encourage\r\n   listeners and other believers to seek God's help whenever they are\r\n   troubled.\r\n       Generally, the songs in Level Up are heavily inspired by the read-\r\n ~ ings of the Bible tho~gh they are presente? in an eclectic rang~ of\r\n   music - reggae, Latm pop, Congolese Lmgala, Zouk, Amencan\r\n   hip-pop and ballads infused with African sounds and rhythms.\r\n       Milele was formed in the late 1980s, and many a fan in the United,\r\n    States and Kenya find the group exciting to listen to because of its\r\n    rich blend of East African gospel pop and urban contemporary\r\n    music.\r\n       The members had an ear for music while in high school. Both\r\n    Kanji and Mwaurah        attended Nyeri Baptist\u00b7 High School while\r\n    Christian and Kaima went to Kijabe High and St Mary's School,\r\n    Nairobi, respectively.\r\n       They surprisingly l!nked up i~ ~s Angeles in 1998 when they\r\n    went to study in Amenca.

The album features songs such as Narrow, Tucheze Ngoma,\r\n     Love So Right, Hold On, Sanjoloma, and The Highway.\r\n       Mwaurah says the group has great dreams they hope to realise\r\n     back home. One of their grand missions is to establish a multi-                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \"\r\n     purpose recreational facility in Kenya.
