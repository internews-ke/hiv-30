                                    Similarly, HIV prevalence rates might be
                                stable in country C, suggesting that new infec-
                                tions are occurring at a stable rate. That may
                                not be the case, howev~r. Country C could be
                                experiencing higher rates of Aids mortality
                                (as people infected a decade or so earlier die
                                in large numbers), and an increase in new
                                infections. Overall, HIV prevalence rates
                                would not illuminate those details of the
                                country's epidemic ..
                                    So a measure of HIV incidence (the
                                number of new infections observed over a
                                year among previously uninfected people)
                                would help complete the picture of current
                                 trends. The problem is that measuring HIV
                                 incidence is expensive and complicated and
                                 difficult to carry out regularly at the national
                                 level in most countries.
                                     None of this means, however, that recent
                                 trends are a mystery. Regular measurement

                                 people can serve as a proxy, albeit imperfect,
                                 for HIV incidence. Because of their age,

                                      As the world enters the third decade of the
                                   Aids epidemi,c, its impact is undeniable.
                                   Wherever       the epidemic        has spread
                                   unchecked,      it is robbing countries        of
                                   resources and capacities on which human
                                  security and development depend.
                                      In some regions, the HIV/Aids pandemic is
                                  driving ever-larger parts of nations towards
                                   destitution. The scale of the Aids crisis now
                                   outstrips even the worst-case scenarios of a
                                   decade ago. Dozens of countries are already
                                   in the grip of serious epidemics, and many
                                   more are on the brink.
