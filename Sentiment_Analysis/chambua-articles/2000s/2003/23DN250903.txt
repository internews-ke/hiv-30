         failure to enact a crucial Bill against
 crafted.
    Although the HIV and Aids Prevention
 and Control Bill, 2003 - aimed at helping the
 Government to formulate laws and regula-
 tions on the deadly virus - has been pre-
 sented to the Cabinet, it has never been
 tabled in Parliament.
    The groups - among them the Kenya
 Network of Women With Aids and the Asso-
.ciation of People with Aids in Kenya
 (T APW AK) - say that, though the aware-
 ness level has hit the 95 per cent mark, HIV-
 positive people are still being discriminated
 against in the workplace and elsewhere.
    The announcement comes hardly five days
 after the Cabinet approved the Bill, which
 now awaits publication by the AG's office
 before it is debated in Parliament.
    The coalition is demanding its speedy
 debate and enactment to protect the two
  million-plus HIV-positive individuals.
    "Despite the high awareness levels, we still
  see our people being discriminated against,
  mainly at workplaces," says Ms Asunta                        •                                                                                                          ", ..                   Photo/Peter Karuri

   The Kenwa chief notes that the delay in
