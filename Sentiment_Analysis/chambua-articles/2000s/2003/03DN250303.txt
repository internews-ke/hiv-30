rate to late reporting for medical atten
tion.

we will all be infc,tvd before we realise

medication, most people were still reluc
tant to seek treatment.

number of health facilities with labora
tory services in the province and set up
‚I
mobile ones to check the spread of the
disease, he added.
“We are going lo upgrade the facilities
and equip them with laboratories to
bring the services closer to the people.”
