The UN, the Economic Community of\r\n  West African States (Ecowas) and several governments\r\n  condemned the coup-. But they were unable to bring\r\n  pressure on the army to restore Mr Yala to the presidency.\r\n     However, when on July 16 soldiers overthrew President\r\n  Fradigue de Menezes of the tiny island state of Sao Tome\r\n  and Principe, just off the West African coast, intense\r\n  international pressure. forced the military to back down.\r\n     At that point, many observers declared that the era of\r\n  coups in Africa was over. Now, it seems, that verdict was\r\n  premature.\r\n     It turns out, however, that Mr Menezes was restored to\r\n  power only because Sao Tome is oil-rich and and he had\r\n  only j~st returned from a visit to theUS, where he was\r\n  feted and praised by President George Bush.\r\n     The military was forced to hand back power because the '\r\n  world's most powerful states felt they couldn't trust Sao\r\n  Tome's oil wealth to an army.\r\n     Bissau, on the other hand, is qirt poor and has not\r\n  discovered any strategic minerals. The stakes are low, so                                                                         BETWEEN US 0 KWAMCHETSI MAKOKHA\r\n  the world doesn't care much who rules there.\r\n    There are useful lessons in this for both Ecowas and the\r\n  African Union.
