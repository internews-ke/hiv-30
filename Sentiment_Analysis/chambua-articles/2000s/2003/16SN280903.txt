                       infected with Aids featured
                       prominently at the six-day
                       International     Scientific
    Con erence ort Aids, which ended in Nairobi
    last Friday.
        Aids lobbyists and sufferers poured scorn
    on African leaders, especially the politicians,
    accusing them of ignoring the plight of the
    infected, but who cannot afford the anti-
    retroviral drugs.
        Transnational pharmaceutical companies,
    which had a big presence at the talks at the
    Kenyatta International Conference Centre,
    were also no~ spared. The firms were accused
    of failing to lower the prices of anti-
    retrovirals, and putting them out of the reach
    of the poor, who equally need them.
        The "people's tribunal" held on Tuesday,
•   marked the .beginning of dissent. More than
    200 Kenyans infected with Aids accused the
    Government of paying lip-service to need to
    provide the life-prolonging drugs to the
    250,000 people living with the virus.
        They then went ahead to pass a "guilty"
    verdict against the Government. However,
    some welcomed reports that Kenya would
    soon supply free ARVs to 6,000 Aids patie!lts
    in public hospitals.
        The demonstrators said that although they
    welcomed last week's Government move on
     treatment in public hospitals, it has yet to
