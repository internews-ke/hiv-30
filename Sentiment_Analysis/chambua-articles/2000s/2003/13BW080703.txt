   Washington, Monday
              travel industry trade
   A          group is campaigning
            . against new federal rules
   aimed at preventing foreign ter-
   rorists from entering the country,
   warning that the measures, as
   planned, will hurt tourism and do
   little to enhance security.
       The Travel Industry Associa-
   tion of America urged airline,
   hotel and cruise line representa:
   tives to write letters to members
   of Congress and officials within
   the Bush administration and
   described several directives from
   the State Department and the
   Department of Homeland Secu-
   rity as "ill-advised."
       The rules, which go into effect
   over the next six months, will
   require machine-readable       pass-
   ports for tourists entering the
   country without a visa; finger-
   printing of every international
   traveler; and interviews with
   applicants for a non-immigrant
   US visa.
       The organisation said the gov-
   ernment has not appropriated
   enough funding, personnel or
   equipment to carry out the rules
   in an efficient manner.
       Stuart Patt, a spokesman for
   the Bureau of Consular Affairs,
   a division of the State Depart-
   ment, disagreed,
       "This is something we've been
   studying very carefully for a long
   time," Patt said. "We wouldn't
   have put in the new rules if we
   thought that we could not imple-
    ment them." (AP)
