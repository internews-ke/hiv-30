         a light sentence for an offence that sometimes attracts
A        man found guilty of defiling a 12-year-old girL That was
sentences of up to 14 years.
    What seven years means for the 40-year-old who committed
the beastly offence is that he could be out in just over four
years to prey on other girls of tender age. Meanwhile, his
young victim will be condemned to carry the scars for life,
And more.
    For Julius Lemeno Lukumani is not guilty just of
defilement. He also carries the virus that causes Aids. As
Mombasa Resident Magistrate Faith Maithya noted, the
accused }ViIIhave condemned his young victim to a
premature and painful death if she contracts the virus.
    The magistrate added that, in defiling the girl, the accused
 was doing much more than satisfying his lust; he was
 maliciously exposing the innocent young girl to the HIV virus.
 If so, then even the charge of defilement means he was getting
 away with a slap on the wrist. He should have been charged
 with attempted murder.
    Other Commonwealth jurisdictions have successfully, under
 their existing laws, set precedents. A wide latitude is given to
 interpretation of the law. Nowhere in the statutes is the mode
 of murder or attempted murder specified,
    It might be defined, in the layman's terms, as deliberately
 and maliciously depriving or attempting deprive another                                                                                                                  DAVID MAKALI

 murder is an axe, a gun, a knife, bare hands, poison or a
 depraved sexual assault.                                                                               Lessons from Goldenberg probe
    Any HIV-positive person who plans and executes the crime
 of rape or defilement surely also knows that he is exposing his
 victim to HIV-Aids and death.
