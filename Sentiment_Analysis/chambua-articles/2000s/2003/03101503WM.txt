{"text": "\ufeffDaily Nation October 15, 2003\r\n\r\nONE WOMANS WAR AGAINST A DEADLY ENEMY\r\n\r\nBY ELISHA OTIENO \r\nIt Took a lot of courage for Jane Adhiambo to go public about her\r\nHIV-positive status. But once she made the decision, she has not\r\nlooked back, and has made it a personal mission to talk about\r\nHIV/Aids at public fora, including churches and schools.\r\nThe 32-year-old school teacher is now a well known figure in Migori\r\nDistrict, where she advocates abstinence and, if this is not possible,\r\nuse of condoms, to prevent HIV infection.\r\nHaving lost her husband, Isaac Otieno, to Aids in 2001, Jane is\r\nconvinced that by talking publicly about the disease, she can achieve\r\ntwo things: convince people that the scourge is real and show that\r\none can live positively after infection. Her openness about the subject\r\nhas endeared her to the residents of Migori District, where she\r\nlives. Her testimonies on positive living, advice on caring for those\r\naffected and infected and caution on avoiding infection have convinced\r\nmany that Aids is a reality.\r\n\"I want to ensure that information on Aids reaches all parts of\r\nMigori and the entire Nyanza Province and convince people that the\r\nscourge is with us,\" she says. \"That is why I attend public functions in\r\nthe district to talk to people and convince them to change their attitudes\r\nand behaviour to avoid infection.\"\r\n\"I want to change the perception among some members of my\r\ncommunity that Aids is a curse.\" she adds.\r\nSpirited attempts\r\nContrary to the expectations of her community, Jane has refused to\r\nre-marry, arguing that re-marriage is one of the major causes of Aids\r\ninfection.\r\n\" I flatly refused to be inherited\r\ndespite spirited attempts\r\nby my husband's clan. I did not\r\nwant to infect anybody. My\r\nconscience would not allow me\r\nto do so,\" she asserts ..\r\nThe grave reality of Jane's\r\nstatus dawned on her in 2000,\r\nwhen she tested positive at the\r\nHoma Bay District Hospital.\r\nShe was prompted to go for\r\nvoluntary testing following her\r\nhusband's prolonged ailment.\r\nThey had married in 1993 after\r\ngraduating from Migori\r\nTeachers Training College.\r\n\"My husband had become\r\nvery sick and we were both\r\nadvised to go for an Aids test.\r\nThe outcome was shocking.\r\nWe were positive,\" she says.\r\n\"The man could not believe his\r\nears, but that was the reality.\"\r\nCOURAGE: Jane Adhiambo Consequently, she does not\r\nwant her past to bog her down.\r\n\"I can't tell who infected the other, but the fact is that we both tested\r\npositive. All the same, I do not want to dwell on the past because\r\nthat can haunt me and consume my energy, thus clouding my vision\r\nfor the future,\" she says.\r\n\"Worry brings stress and death, so I steer clear of it. I eat well and\r\nuse anti-retroviral drugs,\" she says, adding that she often seeks medication\r\nwhen attacked by opportunistic diseases.\r\nA member of Power of Jesus Around the World Church, Jane\r\ngoes to church every Sunday and shares her experiences with other\r\nmembers. She says the church has not been spared by the scourge\r\nand is losing both leaders and ordinary members to Aids.\r\nHer challenge to others living with Aids is to come out in the open\r\nand talk freely about their status.\r\nFacing reality\r\n\"Let us stop hiding and face the reality about our condition. That is\r\nthe only way we can help ourselves and our communities,\" she says.\r\nOne of the activities that Jane is involved is coordinating Help\r\nWidows and Orphans Group, an organisation involved in creating\r\nAids awareness through drama and music concerts.\r\nThe organisation has set up a computer training centre in Migori\r\nTown, which raises money to support Aids orphans and widows.\r\nJane advocates home-based care for those living with Aids, saying\r\ncommunities need to support those affected of'infected to cope with .\r\ntheir conditions ..\r\nThe infection rate in Migori District stands at 30 per cent, with the\r\nworst hit being young people aged between 15 and 25. And as the\r\nnumber of widows and widowers rises, so does that of orphans.\r\nMigori District Hospital'Superintendent Peter Okoth says HIV\r\npositive patients take about 60 per cent of the beds in the institution.\r\nHard hit is Sony Sugar Company in Awendo, where factory workers\r\nand farmers are vulnerable since they have disposable incomes,\r\nwhich tempt some to engage in unsafe sexual activities. Equally at\r\nrisk are communities living around Lake Victoria, where good\r\nreturns from fishing lead some to live recklessly.\r\nA government survey shows a slow change in sexual behaviour\r\nmainly attributable to deep-seated cultural beliefs and practices, coupled\r\nwith high levels of poverty and illiteracy."}
