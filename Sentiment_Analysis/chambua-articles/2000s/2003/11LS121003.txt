Gripping song
and dance on
fatal scourge            By LUCY KILALO
            here is little new information a Kenyan on the street can
 T           be told about HIV/Aids. Or is there? Information about
             HIV/Aids is at its peak: Mother-to-child transmission,
             dirty needles, unprotected sex .... yet new infections are
             climbing. Repackaging that information in a way that
 grips attention is the challenge th~t Shades ~Iassic, a. co~munity
 youth group, has risen to. Formed 1n.20.0l at Klbera, NaIrobI, one of
 Africa's biggest slums, Shades ClassIc IS a dance troupe of young
 people preaching about the danger of l:IIV/Aids ..               ,       .
     Programme coordinator Israel K.odlaga, ~ne Qf ~he fIve plOnee~s,
 believes youth have a role to play In educating theIr peers on socIal
 issues.
      HIV/Aids is real to these young people. Half of them are orphans,
 their parents having been snatched by .the scourge. And they are
  determined not to shed more tears. WIth dance and poetry, they
  capture audiences: getting to the heart of the matter in the language
  of the street.
       The group hopes to make people accept that HIV /Aid~ exists, to
  give the disease a human face and to show that something can ~e
  done about it.
       Kodiaga vividly recalls the day this year when the W orld Ba~k
  President Mr James Wolfenson, visited and they performed for hIm
  at the arboretum. Mr WQ\fenson was so impressed that he remarked
   that out of the 148 towns he had visited, it was in Nairobi that he saw
   the best performance on HIV /~ids.           ,
 . Dancing to the tune of Achleng Abura s Udzokwenda, and other
   songs, they explore themes like the battle of wits between Coastal
   women and their up country co~nterp~rts (Wana~ak~ wa bam): You
    are left gazing at the mastery wIth whIch t~ey recIte IIn~ ~pon line of
    poetry. Suddenly, a sombre audience .lIghts ~p, WaIting to hear
    another anecdote about the society in whIch we hve.
        Their dance demonstrates the pain of unfaithfulness in ~arriag~ or
    a relationship. And if your mind slips for a second, you mIght faIl to
    understand the illustration of the banana. "So sweet yet dangerous,"
    says Daniel in Banana, one of the poems.
        The poems are written by Haji Hemed ~nd t~e dances are choreo-
     graphed by Jennifer Asego, bot~ rece.nt u~lverslty graduates ..
        The poems are dramatic and identify wIth t~e peopl.e. Sample thIs:
     Coastal women claiming the)' are the gurus. In the kItchen a~d the
     upcountry ones saying they kno~ how to tOIL But the man IS then
     warned not to look beyond the skirt.               _.
         Shades Classics began staging performances at Kibera. Gradually,
     they got better known and now receive dozens of invitations to per-
     form at various functions ..                     ,                 .
         They have been working with the NatI~nal AIds Contro~ CouncIl to
     educate students on HIV/Aids. The PartIc:.patory EducatIOnal Thea-
      tre Against Aids in School (P~T AAS) programme advocate~ for
      abstinence and has been dubbed No sex please! We are stud~nts .
         The idea says Kodiaga, is to educate the students to remain chaste
      until they ~re old enough to make more informed choices in relation-
      ships. The group expects to launch a .video and will circulate it to
       schools as an HIV/Aids resource matenal.
         They have performed for organisations such as Total Kenya, Fed-
      eration of Women Lawyers, Glaxo Smithk line, Nation Media Group,
     and Forum for African Women Educationalists. They plan to tour
     more towns in Kenya with their unique message ..
         "We have to win we must, we cannot afford to faIl as many years
     from now our gran'dchildren will ask about our ~ontributio~    ~?this
     war against Aids. They will wonder what we dId to stop It, says
      Kodiaga.
