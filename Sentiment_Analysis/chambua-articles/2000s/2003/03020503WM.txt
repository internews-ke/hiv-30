{"text": "\ufeffDAILY WEDNESDAY Nation/ February 5,2003 \r\nI KEEP GETTING INTO RUINOUS RELATIONSHIPS\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Amani,\r\nI am a 50-year-old married man. Every time I get a loan, there\r\nare women who are always ready to help me spend it, after\r\nwhich they disappear. I have helped a good number, especially\r\nthe bereaved. They normally talk very nicely, and I always end\r\nup in their arms. I have bought houses, plots and cars for them.\r\nI only come to my senses w len the money is gone and my family\r\nneeds food and clothing.\r\nTheir approach is always that they want to do business with\r\nme. In the end, though, the;' con me. Then they resurface when\r\nthere is another loan. The s'upid thing about me is that I do not\r\nknow how to put them off. ) always pity them because they have\r\nno husbands.\r\nThe funny thing is that I have not bought even a plot for\r\nmyself and now I am about to retire. I prefer to give these peo-\r\n.. pIe money and forget my mm family. Please help me out of\r\nthese problems before it is tDOlate. My wife tells me I will get\r\nAids, but we end up quarreling, because I do not want to hear of\r\nit.\r\nPlease Amani, you are tb! last hope. I do not want to lose my\r\nfamily.\r\nDear worried man;\r\nIt is good to help the bereaved, but doing it in exchange for sex\r\ncan be dangerous, especiall) in this era of HIV IAids. Your wife\r\nis, therefore, right in telling {au about the risk of getting Aids\r\nfrom your relationships. It i~ a fact that the highest mode of\r\ntransmission of HIV IAids is through sex. From your letter, you\r\nhave stated that you go for t ereaved women. Do you ever take\r\ntime to know what killed tht ir husbands? Do you use any pro- ..\r\ntection?\r\nYour other concern is the spending of your loan on property\r\nfor the bereaved women, who keep on dumping you after your\r\nmoney is finished. You also ceep falling back into the arms of\r\nother widows immediately y )u are rejected. Could this be love\r\naddition? Love addiction is ,ill ingrown dependency relationship\r\nwith another person serving as the object of our need for security.\r\nThe addict, therefore, needs the other person to make life\r\nbearable.\r\nThe addicted person goes to the lover with the aim of filling a\r\nvoid in himself. The relation::hip becomes the centre of his life\r\nbecause it offers him solace that contrasts sharply from what he\r\nfinds at home. The person then keeps on returning to it more\r\nand more. When it is not the 'e, the person feels lost. The addict\r\nis, therefore, just drawn to th e object (in your case the bereaved\r\nwomen) for security and pie, sure, but the object traps them\r\ninstead of offering security, and prevents them from growth due\r\nto dependency.\r\nThis creates a feeling of in.ldequacy as they have to keep on\r\nleaning heavily on the object (the woman) to achieve their \"happiness\".\r\nAs they get deeper mto the problem, their world\r\nbecomes narrower as they neglect their families, themselves,\r\nfriends, colleagues, relatives. md responsibility in order to focus\r\non their lovers, who usually are very demanding.\r\nTheir emotional security e epends on the relationship and\r\ntheir fear of rejection is intensified as they get more and more\r\ninvolved with the person. Thl:y are ready to using any means to\r\nkeep the relationship. In case of rejection, the addicts desperately\r\ntries to find another par tner so as to re-establish their \"artificial\r\nequilibrium\". The addict feels completely powerless over\r\nthe relationship. Could this b ~what is happening to you?\r\nYour self-worth seems to have been destroyed by bad relationships\r\nand a long string of unsuccessful attempts to replace\r\nthem by using money to control or feel powerful to people who\r\nare vulnerable. But instead 01 feeling powerful you feel used.\r\nCould you be trying to satisfy your needs through the wrong\r\nmeans?\r\nYour asking for help could signal your dissatisfaction. Being\r\naware that there is a problem is a good starting point. It might\r\nbe helpful to do a self-evaluation and find out who you are in\r\nrelation to others, what you \\\\ ant from relationships, especially\r\nwith the opposite sex, and YOllr reasons for going into these relationships\r\n- is it for money, Ie ve, sex or a fulfilling relationship.\r\nLearn to repair your own spirit and to know that love is possible\r\nonly when we reach out te another person from our\r\nstrengths rather than our wea messes. Happiness is within you\r\nand you can appraise yourself with other achievements other\r\nthan love - like in your case, having a job that can sustain the\r\nheavy loans that you've beenaking, capability to service them\r\nand a loving wife who caution; you. Lastly, try to create an emotional\r\nbalance by meeting your own needs first and then other\r\nneeds.\r\nLearn to take the risk of sa) ing no to these women and taking\r\nresponsibility over your life. III case of need for further help\r\nplease talk to a professional counsellor.\r\nDear Amani,\r\nAmani Counsellors, POBox .11738, Tel:602672/3,\r\nemaikaccti@africaonline.com:'\r\nI keep getting\r\ninto 1~inous\r\nrelationships\r\nAmani Counsellors"}
