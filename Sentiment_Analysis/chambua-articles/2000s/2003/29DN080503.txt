                improved surveillance on strains of the
flu virus in the country, saying it constantly evolves
and can be lethal.
    The Kenya Medical Research Institute (Kemri),
says the epidemic occurred last in the 60s and is
likely to recur again.
    According to scientists, the disease occurs every
40 years.
    '"It is a fact that an epidemic is looming and can
occur in any part of the world," says Dr Jeremiah
Chakaya of Kemri
    A recent study by the National Influenza Sur-
veillance Network, a research arm of the institu-
 tion, on ISO samples discovered that the prevalence
of flu also known as influenza, was about 10-15 per
cent. The samples were taken from persons aged
between 20 and 30 years.
