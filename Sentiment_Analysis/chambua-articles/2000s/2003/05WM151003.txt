      of the local economy and mode of production.
          In many areas, families lost their entire livestock,
     which not only serve as food, but also playa major
      role in the local economy. The last cattle raids
      occurred in April last year between ethnic Turkana
      and Samburu, in which the former lost a great deal
      of their stocks.
          Following the loss of their animals, the traditi?n-

      but soon gave up when most of the shrubs and trees
      withered due to drought. Many families were left
      with no means of livelihood, leading to an exodus
      to urban centres in search of employment. In the
      towns the newcomers were forced to take low-
     paying and exploitative jobs. As a result, many

      some areas, residents have resorted to eating wild
      fruits and plants to survive.

    ~ drought, the cases of Gubatu and Garfasa are com-
       pounded by other factors. For Gubatu, the drought
       is man-made. In the past five years, the river system
