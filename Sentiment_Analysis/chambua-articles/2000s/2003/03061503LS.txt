{"text": "\ufeffSunday Nation/ June 15,2003\r\nThe place of leadership in campaign against Aids\r\n\r\nBy JOE BABENOREIER\r\n\r\nJust as President George Bush offered to\r\nship a boatload of condoms to Africa, an\r\narticle in the Washingtoll Post blamed Kenyan\r\nclergy for our burgeoning population of\r\nAids patients. It quotes a sermon from an\r\nupcountry pastor thundering condemnations.\r\nPreachers, the Post argues, have stymied efforts\r\nto control HIV by telling people condoms don't\r\nwork,\r\nThe NGOs distributing condoms agree, They say\r\nthey arc saving lives by being as aggressive as\r\npossible. But many church leaders remain sceptical.\r\nAfter many years of heavy advertising for\r\n\u00b7condoms all across Kenya. doctors say the\r\nnumber of deaths due to Aids remains the same.\r\nLast September. the US Agency for International\r\nDevelopment (USAid) published a study\r\ntitled: \"Declining HIV Prevalence, Behaviour\r\nChange. and the National Response: What Happened\r\nin Uganda?\" According to the best estimates,\r\nHIV prevalence dropped from 30 per\r\ncent to 5 per cent in about 10 years.\r\n\"This dramatic decline is unique worldwide.\" the\r\nreport notes. Many African countries have had\r\ncondom campaigns. Only one has managed to\r\nbring the spread of HIV under cont'rol. Buried in\r\nthis success story is a crucial fact that contradicts\r\nprevailing opinions and the \"safe-sex\" policies\r\nsponsored by influential NGOs. Getting Ugandans\r\nto use condoms was not the decisive factor.\r\nThe greatest reduction in HIV prevalence took\r\nplace before condoms were widely distributed.\r\nThings changed when people started taking sexual\r\nself-control seriously. The report spells this\r\nout with statistics. making a comparison between\r\nUganda and several other sub-Saharan countries\r\nseverely afflicted by the pandemic. In 1YY5,\r\nUgandan males in the 15 to lY-year-old range\r\n\"were less likely to have ever had sex, more\r\nlikely to be married and keep sex within the\r\nmarriage, and less likely to have multiple partners,\r\nparticularly if never married.\"\r\nTrue Love Waits\r\nThe report suggests'that the key person to push\r\nUgandans towmds a \"zero-grazing policy\" was\r\nPresident Yoweri Museveni. His wife Janet\r\nspearheaded a youth campaign, called \"True\r\nLove Waits\". It is hard to pin down exactly why\r\nthese acts of leadership worked. But they did.\r\nWhen the Ugandan First Couple took their\r\nstand on Aids and began campaigning together,\r\nsomething happened. They reached the hearts\r\nand minds of the people on the street. This\r\nimplies that the key to success lies in a leader's\r\nability to convince people to change.\r\nCan Kenya dramatically reduce HIV prevalence?\r\nDocs it depend on the special effort President\r\nKibaki is now making? If it does. the controversy\r\nover condoms looms as large as ever.\r\nMany religious leaders continue to insist that\r\npushing condoms docs more harm than good.\r\nMany NGOs says Mr Musevcni promoted condoms\r\nshamelessly even while stressing abstinence\r\nand marital fidelity. Who should President\r\nKibaki listen to?\r\nPerhaps the President should listen to himself. In\r\nearly June, after attending the ordination of the\r\nnew bishop of Machakos, he addressed the\r\ncrowd. He has built his presidency on fighting\r\ncorruption and, once again, he spoke briefly but\r\nforcefully. \"Stop stealing.\" He said nothing\r\nabout special treatment for those unwilling to\r\nchange. On the contrary, tie sent them fair warning.\r\n\"If you don't stop stealing, we will catch\r\nyou.\"\r\nPerhaps the public needs an equally forceful\r\nmessage on HIV. \"Save sex for marriage. Be\r\nfaithful to your spouse. If you don't, you will get\r\nAids and it will kill you. We need to change now.\r\nIt's a matter of life or death.\"\r\nThe ABC message being used now is muddled.\r\nTelling people, \"Abstain, Be faithful. use Condoms\"\r\nis like ielling thieves, if can't stop stealing\r\nat least make sure you don't get caught. We\r\ndon't compromise when fighting graft. Why\r\nshould we compromise when encouraging men\r\nand women to respect God's plan for sex'?"}
