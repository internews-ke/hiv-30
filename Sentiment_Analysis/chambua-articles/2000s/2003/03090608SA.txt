It\r\nevery other emotion that could be brought out.\r\n  It has also been a fortnight when Kenyans, united in grief,\r\nput aside their differences, suspended the heated political\r\narguments, to honour a man who stood out for moderation\r\nand reconciliation; a man whose very lifestyle recognised that\r\nthere is a time for work and a time for play; that the skuldug-\r\ngery of politics must not occupy our every waking moment.\r\n  The best tribute we can give Mr Wamalwa, then, is to is\r\nborrow some of the admirable traits he displayed in his publ~c\r\ncareer. Foremost, as we say the final farewell this afternoon,\r\nwe must conduct ourselves with dignity and sobriety.\r\n  Mourn, we will, each in his or her own way and to his or her\r\nheart's content.
