The latest polls show around 70 per cent back EU\r\nentry, crowning a decade of often painful reforms. Estonia also joins\r\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation next year.\r\n   The country's economic growth since regaining independence from\r\nthe Soviet Union in 1991 - a robust 5.8 per cent last year - has\r\nbeen one of East Europe's success stories, spurred by higher foreign\r\ninvestment and a surge in tourism ..\r\n   But that growth has been more than matched by the rise in the\r\ncapital's \"red-light\" trade.\r\nBig business, big problem\r\nSex is big business in Tallinn. The city of just 400,000 has up to 3,000\r\nprostitutes and around 50 brothels ..\r\n   \"Prostitution is a .very serious problem for Estonia,\" said Social\r\nAffairs Minister Marko Pomerants, who has vowed to speed up\r\nefforts to tackle the sex trade.\r\n   Prostitution itself is not illegal in Estonia. Pimping - or profiteer-\r\ning from selling others' sexual services - is banned.\r\n   Analysts say the problem is not so much lax legislation, but a lack\r\nof enforcement.\r\n   \"Tallinn's main asset is availability and price,\" said 'Mr Maximus',\r\na frequent Finnish visitor to the capital's brothels.\r\n   Most acknowledge that prostitution is largely a result of poverty,\r\ncombined with the lure of fat profits for the pimps.\r\n   Pomerants said he hoped further economic and social integration\r\nwith the West would help combat a combination of social depriva-\r\ntion, crime and prostitution.\r\n   Like other ex-communist states in Central and Eastern Europe,\r\n Estonia's soaraway economy has brought with it a widening social\r\n gap between the 'haves' and 'have-nots', with regional pockets of\r\n high unemployment, poverty and despair.\r\n. Attitude\r\n Luht said many Estonians also had a get-rich-quick attitude, paying\r\n little heed to moral scruples.\r\n     \"H's a strange form of capitalism. You need money to show off,\r\n but no one asks where it comes from,\" she said.\r\n     A recent study showed a surge in firms touting for prostitutes. At\r\n least 30 companies advertised well-paid jobs for women, but told\r\n undercover researchers they really sought prostitutes.\r\n     \"If a girl earns 1,000 kroons ($69.65) a night, she'll be spoiled,\"\r\n  said Mr Maximus. \"She'll never go back to work in a shop some-\r\n  where for just 2,500 kroons a month.\"\r\n      He said most prostitutes were from Estonia's big Russian minority,\r\n  often from Soviet-style industrial cities in the northeast which have\r\n  suffered most under the new market economy.\r\n      Men from neighbouring Finl.and account for the majority of\r\n  Tallinn's sex tourists, along with local businessmen.

Most new cases were related to drug abuse, itself\r\n  closely linked to the sex trade ..
