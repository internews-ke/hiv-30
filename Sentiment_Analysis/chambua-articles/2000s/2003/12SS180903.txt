              . fatal disease with no specific treatment, smallpox
                had over the ages kilkd millions and left millions
                more scarred for life. Caused by the Variola virus,
                the disease - whose name is derived from the
                Latin word for "spotted" - was particularly
                terrifying because of the ease with which it could
             , spread through contaminated droplets from person
               to person. The,only pre~ention was through
               vaccination; un,treated, it killed more 30 per cent
               of its victims.                            '     .
