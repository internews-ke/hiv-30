DONORS MAKE PLEDGES TO LEND BILLIONS
By Geoffrey Irungu and Isaac ESIPISU 	 

Donors last night pledged to lend
Kenya billions of shillings but failed to
immediately quantify the amount.
The amount would be made public
next week.
Twenty five countries and institutions
pledged the money in a move that
effectively puts an end to the country's
pariah status on the international front.
"Today is a great day for Kenya. We
have been accepted by the International
Monetary Fund and the World
Bank and given pledges by 25 institutions
and countries"
Finance minister David
Mwiraria told a press
conference last night.
The only funds that
were confirmed was the
second disbursement
from the World Bank of
$50 million (Sh3.8
billion).
The money comes only
four days after the International Monetary
Fund unlocked ShI9.5 billion - to
be given in three tranches - starting
with an· immediate release of Sh2.772
billion.
In making the pledges, bilateral
.donors insisted on the need for the gov-
" emment to put in a place a "poorfriendly
budget", fight corruption and
inject funds in programmes to combat
the HIV IAids scourge.
A document obtained by the Nation
titled Statement from the United Kingdom
Government indicated that the
country was ready to offer Sh4 billion
(UK£30 million) a year. The money will
be directed to the government's privatisation,
civil service reforms and HIVI
Aids. In addition to this amount there is
a possibility of the country getting
budget support should it carry out the
reforms already agreed on.
Another document titled The United
States Statement indicated that the US
would give Sh6 billion ($78 million)
through the United States Agency for
International Development (USAid)
over the next three years mainly to fund
the Electoral Commission, Justice and
<;Onstitutional Affairs ministry, legislative
programmes and civil society
groups.
In the same document a further Sh3
billion ($38.5million) was pledged by
the US for the implementation of Kenya's
National HIVIAids Strategic plan
as well as facilitate necessary HIVIAids
and other health
legislation.
The US says in
the document that it
has also developed
a new education
programme which
will support the
government's education
reform programme
and will
focus on taking to school children in
marginalised areas. The amount for this
is not indicated in the statement.
"In the Coast province the programme
will assist communities managing
madrassa early childhood development
centres to develop primary
schools. The programme will strengthen
school management committees, train
teachers and develop curriculum and
learning materials," the US document
said ..
Another amount, not quantified in
the document, would go to fund what'
was described as President George W.
Bush's initiative to fund hunger programmes
in Africa. This is meant to
complement agricultural programmes
and enterprise development initiatives
which are already in place in Kenya.
