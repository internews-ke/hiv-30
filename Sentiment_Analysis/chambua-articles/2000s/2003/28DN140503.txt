       Fighting HIV/AIDS: The Real Challenges
                                                            tackling the disease rnto programmes and work of ail GovernmE'nt Departments
                   IV/AIDS has been in existence for            ••••••••••
                   continued to baffle scientists who.
      H            slightly over 20 years today. In. its
                   deadly march across the globe it has
         have remained locked behind laboratory· ..• '     ..
         doors painstakingly searching for a vaccine
         or a cure without much success. Clearly, it
        would not be difficult, therefore, to under-
        stand why eradicating such a disease .
         remains such a tall order.
            As people continue to die from the pan-
        demic, mankind has no option but to institute
        checks and balances which must be seen to
        supplement all the efforts from the medical
        fraternity. Every government the world over
        has been compelled to come up with strate-
        gies and mechanisms to combat this
        scourge. It is from this necessity that the
        National AIDS Control Council (NACC) was
        born.
            Since its inception soon after HIV/AIDS
       was declared a national disaster in Kenya
       three years ago, NACC has faced serious
       challenges in its role to co-ordinate the
       efforts mounted by several actors to fight the
       HIV/AIDS scourge.
            Based on recommendations and subse-
       quent follow up consultations with stakehold-
       ers, a series of seven cross-cutting chal-
       lenges have emerged that will require
       particular focus during the next three years.
       It will be critical, therefore, that NACC's
       action plan incorporates these issues:-
           Foremost, the strengthening of a co-
      ordinating body at the highest level is essen-
      tial to respond to the multi-sectoral impact of
       HIV/AIDS. The notion that the pandemic                                                       \
      could be confronted strictly as a health emer-            Agriculture Minister Kipruto arap Kirwa signs the visitors' book at the NACC stand during this year's Eldoret Agricultural Society of Kenya Show.
      gency has been replaced by knowledge that                                                         NACC uses ASK shows as one way of reaching out to the public.
      it feeds on and reinforces existing laws and
      malfunctions in social and economic sys-
      tems. Many of the more creative partner-                                                                                                                      Along with trade unions, they are also putting
      ships emerge from the realisation that HIV/                                                                                                                   their networks and resources at the disposal

      implicates everybody.                                                                                                                                         these are an exception and not yet the rule.
