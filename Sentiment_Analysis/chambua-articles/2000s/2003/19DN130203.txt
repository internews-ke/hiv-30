 Fanners cry foul over tsetse
 They clain. research institutions have been taking them for a ride

 F              flies- which cau;e sleeping sickness in man and nagana in cattle - breed in the park
                and then invade t leir farms in Lambwe Valley.
                    Claimed Joe Owiro, a Kamoto village farmer: "Despite many promises in the last
neighbour we have lost 10 high-luality animals to nagana in the last six months."
    Four farmers say they have recently lost 22 cows, worth about Sh220,OOO. hey claim that milk
                                                                                       T
production has declined and bet f cattle quality is low.
    This is despite the presence of major research institutions, like the International Centre for Insect
Physiology and Ecology (Icipe), the Kenya Wildlife Service, the Kenya Trypanosomiasis Research
Centre (Ketri) and an African l nity tsetse control programme.
    The farmers say these institutions and the Government are not doing enough to help them.
    However, Ketri director Dr Hathu Ndung'u says farmers are blowing the issue out of proportion,
that the situation is not as bad a~ they portray it.
    Says Dr Ndung'u: "In Novenber, we intervened to try to reduce the number of tsetse flies in
Lambwe Valley, eventually eralicating them. What we have achieved in the last three months is
encouraging. "
                                               However, he admits that the situation has not been en-

                                               "Icipe is not responsible for tsetse control in Kenya, for
                                            we do not undertake any control for national systems," notes
Prof Onesmo Ole-Moi Yoi, direct or of research and partnerships, Icipe.
    lcipe's role he explains, is to develop new technologies for tsetse control before testing and
validating them under different a:~ro-ecological conditions. In such areas, it trains farmers, communi-
ty health workers and other stake IOlders on these technologies.
    The Lambwe farmers, howevl:r, see a motive in their continued suffering and the presence of
tsetse in the region. It is that local research institutions would like the problem to persist as a means
to attract donor funding.
    A few years ago, the European Union gave Kenya Sh680 million for tsetse control. Tsetse is
estimated to affect 60 per cent of t 1e country's rangelands.
    Out of this money, Icipe is said to have got about Sh367 million. The rest went to the Government.
   The Lambwe Valley was supposed to be a recipient. Yet the farmers allege that no tangible
benefits accrued to them.
   "We were told tsetse eradication was feasible because this is in an isolated area, but we are yet to
see serious efforts to do so," a farn ler observes.
   "Contrary to farmers belief," Dr Ndung'u ripostes, "we are determined to introduce new                                                                                                                PholofCorrespondenl
