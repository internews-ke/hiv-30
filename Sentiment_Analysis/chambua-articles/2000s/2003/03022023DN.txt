Sayd Dr\r\n    Anzala: \"We can mix the approaches and come up with effective\r\n    vaccines. So other approaches Slould be supported to go ahead.\"\r\n    Echoing his sentiments, International Aids Vaccine Initiative l:\\dvises\r\n    that research has to go on until 1vaccine for all HIV strains is found.\r\n    Fears are, however, rife that if the vaccine is proved effective, there\r\n    will be no cause for countries Iil;e Kenya to celebrate. The HIV strain\r\n    the vaccine targets and possible pricing mechanisms may deny\r\n    deserving cases to access it.\r\n    Because it is designed on the b~sis of HIV strain B - the one\r\n    predominant in Europe - it is :;tillnot proved suitable to Africa,\r\n    where the predominant HIV stJain is C.\r\n    In Kenya and the neighbouring countries, the predominant HIV .\r\n    strain is A. Strain B is also found, but only among an extreme\r\n    minority. Researchers make it dear that the vaccine will have to be\r\n    tested in African countries to Sfe if it can also work here.\r\n    World Health Organisatipns de Jate has equally centred on the\r\n    questions of how vaccine deve!(.ped for ~ne strain ~an ,:\"ork on other\r\n    strains. especially those found IIIdevelopmg countnes hke Kenya.\r\n    Similarly, Aids experts say if the vaccine works, the s~all numbe~ of\r\n    Kenyan Aids patient with the ~ strain may n.ot.'ac.cessIt due to pn~es.\r\n    Because VaxGen is a commercIal company, It IShkely to charge high\r\n    prices to recoup its research and development costs.\r\n    Recently, to make it difficult .for developing count~ies to access\r\n    medicine in Europe or Amenca, developed countnes have proposed a\r\n    new rule.\r\n    They want countries that impor. or manufacture ~heaper versions of\r\n     these medicines to do so only under emergency situations.\r\n     This means that, even if one country wants to import the vaccine from\r\n     a cheaper source or to manufac :ure it locally, it has to prove that it is\r\n     facing an emergency situati~n ..
