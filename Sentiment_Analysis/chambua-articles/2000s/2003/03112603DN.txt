We\r\nhave been accepted by the International\r\nMonetary Fund and the World\r\nBank and given pledges by 25 institutions\r\nand countries\"\r\nFinance minister David\r\nMwiraria told a press\r\nconference last night.\r\nThe only funds that\r\nwere confirmed was the\r\nsecond disbursement\r\nfrom the World Bank of\r\n$50 million (Sh3.8\r\nbillion).\r\nThe money comes only\r\nfour days after the International Monetary\r\nFund unlocked ShI9.5 billion - to\r\nbe given in three tranches - starting\r\nwith an\u00b7 immediate release of Sh2.772\r\nbillion.\r\nIn making the pledges, bilateral\r\n.donors insisted on the need for the gov-\r\n\" emment to put in a place a \"poorfriendly\r\nbudget\", fight corruption and\r\ninject funds in programmes to combat\r\nthe HIV IAids scourge.\r\nA document obtained by the Nation\r\ntitled Statement from the United Kingdom\r\nGovernment indicated that the\r\ncountry was ready to offer Sh4 billion\r\n(UK\u00a330 million) a year. The money will\r\nbe directed to the government's privatisation,\r\ncivil service reforms and HIVI\r\nAids. In addition to this amount there is\r\na possibility of the country getting\r\nbudget support should it carry out the\r\nreforms already agreed on.\r\nAnother document titled The United\r\nStates Statement indicated that the US\r\nwould give Sh6 billion ($78 million)\r\nthrough the United States Agency for\r\nInternational Development (USAid)\r\nover the next three years mainly to fund\r\nthe Electoral Commission, Justice and\r\n<;Onstitutional Affairs ministry, legislative\r\nprogrammes and civil society\r\ngroups.\r\nIn the same document a further Sh3\r\nbillion ($38.5million) was pledged by\r\nthe US for the implementation of Kenya's\r\nNational HIVIAids Strategic plan\r\nas well as facilitate necessary HIVIAids\r\nand other health\r\nlegislation.\r\nThe US says in\r\nthe document that it\r\nhas also developed\r\na new education\r\nprogramme which\r\nwill support the\r\ngovernment's education\r\nreform programme\r\nand will\r\nfocus on taking to school children in\r\nmarginalised areas. The amount for this\r\nis not indicated in the statement.\r\n\"In the Coast province the programme\r\nwill assist communities managing\r\nmadrassa early childhood development\r\ncentres to develop primary\r\nschools. The programme will strengthen\r\nschool management committees, train\r\nteachers and develop curriculum and\r\nlearning materials,\" the US document\r\nsaid ..\r\nAnother amount, not quantified in\r\nthe document, would go to fund what'\r\nwas described as President George W.\r\nBush's initiative to fund hunger programmes\r\nin Africa. This is meant to\r\ncomplement agricultural programmes\r\nand enterprise development initiatives\r\nwhich are already in place in Kenya."}
