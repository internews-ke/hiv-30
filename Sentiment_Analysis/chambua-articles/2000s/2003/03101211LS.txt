Or is there? Information about\r\n             HIV/Aids is at its peak: Mother-to-child transmission,\r\n             dirty needles, unprotected sex .... yet new infections are\r\n             climbing. Repackaging that information in a way that\r\n grips attention is the challenge th~t Shades ~Iassic, a. co~munity\r\n youth group, has risen to. Formed 1n.20.0l at Klbera, NaIrobI, one of\r\n Africa's biggest slums, Shades ClassIc IS a dance troupe of young\r\n people preaching about the danger of l:IIV/Aids ..               ,       .\r\n     Programme coordinator Israel K.odlaga, ~ne Qf ~he fIve plOnee~s,\r\n believes youth have a role to play In educating theIr peers on socIal\r\n issues.\r\n      HIV/Aids is real to these young people. Half of them are orphans,\r\n their parents having been snatched by .the scourge. And they are\r\n  determined not to shed more tears. WIth dance and poetry, they\r\n  capture audiences: getting to the heart of the matter in the language\r\n  of the street.\r\n       The group hopes to make people accept that HIV /Aid~ exists, to\r\n  give the disease a human face and to show that something can ~e\r\n  done about it.\r\n       Kodiaga vividly recalls the day this year when the W orld Ba~k\r\n  President Mr James Wolfenson, visited and they performed for hIm\r\n  at the arboretum. Mr WQ\\fenson was so impressed that he remarked\r\n   that out of the 148 towns he had visited, it was in Nairobi that he saw\r\n   the best performance on HIV /~ids.           ,\r\n . Dancing to the tune of Achleng Abura s Udzokwenda, and other\r\n   songs, they explore themes like the battle of wits between Coastal\r\n   women and their up country co~nterp~rts (Wana~ak~ wa bam): You\r\n    are left gazing at the mastery wIth whIch t~ey recIte IIn~ ~pon line of\r\n    poetry. Suddenly, a sombre audience .lIghts ~p, WaIting to hear\r\n    another anecdote about the society in whIch we hve.\r\n        Their dance demonstrates the pain of unfaithfulness in ~arriag~ or\r\n    a relationship. And if your mind slips for a second, you mIght faIl to\r\n    understand the illustration of the banana. \"So sweet yet dangerous,\"\r\n    says Daniel in Banana, one of the poems.\r\n        The poems are written by Haji Hemed ~nd t~e dances are choreo-\r\n     graphed by Jennifer Asego, bot~ rece.nt u~lverslty graduates ..\r\n        The poems are dramatic and identify wIth t~e peopl.e.

Gradually,\r\n     they got better known and now receive dozens of invitations to per-\r\n     form at various functions ..                     ,                 .\r\n         They have been working with the NatI~nal AIds Contro~ CouncIl to\r\n     educate students on HIV/Aids. The PartIc:.patory EducatIOnal Thea-\r\n      tre Against Aids in School (P~T AAS) programme advocate~ for\r\n      abstinence and has been dubbed No sex please! We are stud~nts .\r\n         The idea says Kodiaga, is to educate the students to remain chaste\r\n      until they ~re old enough to make more informed choices in relation-\r\n      ships. The group expects to launch a .video and will circulate it to\r\n       schools as an HIV/Aids resource matenal.\r\n         They have performed for organisations such as Total Kenya, Fed-\r\n      eration of Women Lawyers, Glaxo Smithk line, Nation Media Group,\r\n     and Forum for African Women Educationalists. They plan to tour\r\n     more towns in Kenya with their unique message ..\r\n         \"We have to win we must, we cannot afford to faIl as many years\r\n     from now our gran'dchildren will ask about our ~ontributio~    ~?this\r\n     war against Aids. They will wonder what we dId to stop It, says\r\n      Kodiaga.\r\nPage \f\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------Trial Version-----------------------\r\n\r\nConvert PDF to Text Desktop Software.\r\n\r\nCopyright Convertpdftotext.net 2014.\r\n\r\nTo remove these lines, please activate your software from http://www.convertpdftotext.net/buynow.htm\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------"}
