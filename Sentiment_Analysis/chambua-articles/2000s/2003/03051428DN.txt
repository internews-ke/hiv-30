Clearly, it\r\n        would not be difficult, therefore, to under-\r\n        stand why eradicating such a disease .\r\n         remains such a tall order.\r\n            As people continue to die from the pan-\r\n        demic, mankind has no option but to institute\r\n        checks and balances which must be seen to\r\n        supplement all the efforts from the medical\r\n        fraternity. Every government the world over\r\n        has been compelled to come up with strate-\r\n        gies and mechanisms to combat this\r\n        scourge. It is from this necessity that the\r\n        National AIDS Control Council (NACC) was\r\n        born.\r\n            Since its inception soon after HIV/AIDS\r\n       was declared a national disaster in Kenya\r\n       three years ago, NACC has faced serious\r\n       challenges in its role to co-ordinate the\r\n       efforts mounted by several actors to fight the\r\n       HIV/AIDS scourge.\r\n            Based on recommendations and subse-\r\n       quent follow up consultations with stakehold-\r\n       ers, a series of seven cross-cutting chal-\r\n       lenges have emerged that will require\r\n       particular focus during the next three years.\r\n       It will be critical, therefore, that NACC's\r\n       action plan incorporates these issues:-\r\n           Foremost, the strengthening of a co-\r\n      ordinating body at the highest level is essen-\r\n      tial to respond to the multi-sectoral impact of\r\n       HIV/AIDS.
