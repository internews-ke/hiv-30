           The tourist resort of Malindi should, for instance, pro-
        mote greater understandin~ of issues, such as, conserva-
        tion and biodiversity. "You might be astonished to find
        out how uneducated citizells might be touched by such
        issues and might be eager to volunteer their time and
        efforts in order to help ane improve their district," said
        Ms Dissette.
           In Nairobi, Mr Consaga Khisa, the sales and market-
        ing manager of the The St mley, a Sarova Group hotel,
        said corruption must be cu"bed to win favour and good-
        will with donors and foreign missions. "We also have to
        curb the rampant insecuricy, and forestall· activities of
        vigilante groups like Mun;liki, whose activities portray
        Kenya as a violent society.'
           Ms Mwangi called for tt e strengthening, training and
        adequate funding of the Tourist Police Unit to ensure
        the visitors' safety.
           But in the long run, what is required is a growing
        economy that can provide m environment conducive for
        investment. "Investor inte"est in the county will have a
        positive effect on tourism," Mr Khisa said.
           "We have to improve infrastructure, especially the
        roads leading to the main' ourist attractions."
           Adequate and affordab e financing for rehabilitation
        of tourism infrastructure. especially at the Coast, is
        another challenge. Domes:ic tourism must be promoted
        to achieve the twin goals of enhancing the sustainabi]ity
        of tourism and creating ar understanding and apprecia-
