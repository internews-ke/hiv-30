CALL FOR AFFORDABLE AIDS DRUGS

FIRST LADIES TO PUSH FOR CHEAPER ANTIRETROVIRALS AND FIGHT STIGMA

African First Ladies yesterday resolved
to push for cheaper antiretroviral drugs
for Aids patients on the continent.
They would" also ,step up efforts to fight stigma and discrimination asso-
ciated with Aids and involve those
infected with HIV in the war.
These were among the seven declarations
made at the close of the two-day
Organisation of African First Ladies
Against Aids conference at Nairobi's
Safari Park Hotel.
The wives of presidents and heads of
state spoke at a news conference
shortly after
scores of delegates were
moved to tears by Ms
Joan Nyambura who lives
with my and who made
a passionate plea for the
protection and care of
widows and orphans.
"I'm not sadistic. I'm
not a statistic. I'm not a
sufferer. I'm not a victim .... I'm a woman,
I'm a mother, I'm a daughter, I'm a
survivorl" she declared in her strong
resolve to live, to the applause from the
delegates.
Ms Nyambura, a housewife from
Murang'a, said she lost her businessman
husband to Aids three years ago. "To
some, Aids is an academic subject, to
others it's an enterprise, but to me, it's
an experience," she said.
She questioned the wisdom of spending
billions of shillings on conferences
by NGOs instead of using the money on
cheaper antiretrovirals~llY in the
rural areas.
"I speak for the rural wo e me,
who has been sti and disinherited.
We pope" at the organisation will
, 'oe'ptd'ductive. Let this conference not
be another talk shop," she added.
In th<:;irst<)tcm¢t, the First Ladies
said the Aids spread among women and
girls was accelerated by cultural factors,
ignorance, poverty and violence often
meted out by men.
"This type of violence includes rape
and child defilement," said a statement
read on their behalf by Rwanda's Mrs
Jeannette Kagame.
"We will strongly advocate
increased access to
affordable care and treatment,
including scaling up
aCcess to antiretrovirals.
We will advocate laws
and specifically family
laws governing aspects of
gender relations at the
household level in our
respective countries to deter this violence
against women," Mrs Kagame
added.
She was accompanied by Kenya's
First Lady, Mrs Lucy Kibaki, and their
Guinean counterpart, Mrs Henriett
Conte.
Those of Burundi, Gabon, Cameroon,
Swaziland, Malawi, Senegal and Benin
also attended the press conference.
The talks were a satellite of the 13th
International Conference on Aids and
Sexually Transmitted Infections in Africa,
which opened in Nairobi on Sunday.

WHO PLEADS FOR GREATER ACCESS TO MEDICINE

By Nation Correspondent

The "failure by the developed
world to provide life-prolonging
Aids drugs to millions of
patients has been described as a
global emergency.
In a statement presented during
the Aids talks at the KenyaHa
International Conference
Centre, Nairobi, yesterday, the
World Health Organisation says
the anti-retrovirals are available
at a Sh75 a day or less, but do
not reach th" people who need
them most.
Six million people in the
developing countries are living
with HIV and need the antiretrovirals.
But fewer than
300,000 have access to them.
In sub-Saharan Africa, where' -
most of the people in need of
treatment live, only 50,000 are
receiving treatment.
The statement says WHO is to
work with UNAids and other
partners to tackle the treatment
emergency.
The two UN organisations
said they were renewing their
commitment to providing antiretrovirals
to 3 million people by
the end of 2!Kl5.
"We will use the rapid
response skills we have learnt in
responding to complex emergencies
in Afghanistan, Liberia
and Iraq and in quickly controlling
the recent severe acute respiratory
syndrome outbreak,"
WHO said in the statement.

WOMEN MORE WILLING TO KNOW THEIR STATUS

By Nation Correspondent
More young women voluntarily
go for HlY/Aids testing than
men, a recent survey indicates.
Testing among both young
men and women has continued
to increase in the past three
years.
The findings by Behavioural
Surveillance Survey say there
was a higher infection rate in girl
adolescents than in boys in the
past two years.
Education
The study, however, shows
that only 12 per cent of youths
interviewed said they had been
tested for HIY.
Testing increased with age
and socio-economic level, Ms
Carol Ngare of the· National
Aids/STD, Control Programme
said.
Ms Ngare said: "In both the
male and female population,
higher levels of education are
associated with much increased
use of testing services".
Ms Ngare was presenting a
paper on Experience with HIV
Testing among Kenya's Youth
Population at the Kenyatta
International Conference Centre
yesterday.
The session was part of the
ongoing 13th International Conference
on HIY/Aids and Sexually
Transmitted Diseases in
Africa.
According to the survey,
although VCTs were reaching
the rural areas, the centres were
still underserved.
The survey conducted in
October last year sampled eight
different risk groups where the
focus was Uflmarried, out of
school youth aged between 15
years and 24 years.
In the 10 districts sampled
3,23\) females and 2,8\)() males
were interviewed. '
The findings also indicate that
females were more likely to
report testing than males of the
same age, especially among the
sexually active group.
