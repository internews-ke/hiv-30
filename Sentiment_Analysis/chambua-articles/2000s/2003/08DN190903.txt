  Coups: Why the hypocrisy?
          the military. ~
          uinea-Bissau's President Kumba Yala on Wednesday
  G       formally signed an agreement surrendering power to
     The army detained Mr Yala on Sunday and announced it
  was taking over. The UN, the Economic Community of
  West African States (Ecowas) and several governments
  condemned the coup-. But they were unable to bring
  pressure on the army to restore Mr Yala to the presidency.
     However, when on July 16 soldiers overthrew President
  Fradigue de Menezes of the tiny island state of Sao Tome
  and Principe, just off the West African coast, intense
  international pressure. forced the military to back down.
     At that point, many observers declared that the era of
  coups in Africa was over. Now, it seems, that verdict was
  premature.
     It turns out, however, that Mr Menezes was restored to
  power only because Sao Tome is oil-rich and and he had
  only j~st returned from a visit to theUS, where he was
  feted and praised by President George Bush.
     The military was forced to hand back power because the '
  world's most powerful states felt they couldn't trust Sao
  Tome's oil wealth to an army.
     Bissau, on the other hand, is qirt poor and has not
  discovered any strategic minerals. The stakes are low, so                                                                         BETWEEN US 0 KWAMCHETSI MAKOKHA
  the world doesn't care much who rules there.
    There are useful lessons in this for both Ecowas and the
  African Union. If their condemnation of undemocratic                                               How Narc courts public odium
