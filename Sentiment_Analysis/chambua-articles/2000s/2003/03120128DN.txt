In fact de-stigmatization of the disease         we should take up the challenge and launch a similar initiative.\r\n      should be the new focus in fighting the war.

This is the first time in 13 years that a world focus on women\r\n     In the West, where access to ho~ta1 and medication is a jealously guarded human             will be part of World Aids Day. This is commendable as women and children are the\r\n     right, Aids is fast being tamed- aitd reduced to the status of such other treatment-        most vulnerable groups.\r\n     by-management ailments as diabetes, heart disease and some cancers.\r\n                                                                                                As earlier noted, the youth are the worst hit by this dreaded disease.

Prevention calls for the greatest self-discipline, the greatest care and\r\n     consideration, from each and every one of us. Together, we can stop the seemingly\r\n     Inexorable march of the HIV/Aids holocaust.                                                We must fight this menace together as Kenyans.

These two            efforts being made by various institutions, especially at the grassroots level.\r\n     factors; ignorance and Indifference, also add to the oppression and isolation of the\r\n     people living with Aids.
