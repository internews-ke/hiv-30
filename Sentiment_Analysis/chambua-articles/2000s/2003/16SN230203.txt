             he global tourism market is expected to hit
             the one-billion-tourists-a-year  mark by.
             2010. But Kenya's share of the cake in tbe
             next eight years will depend on the imple-
             mentation of a marketing initiative spear-
             headed by the Kenya Tourist Board, the
 Ministry of Tourism and Information, and other play-
"ers in the industry.
    Annual tourist arrivals in Kenya are still below a
 million a year, leading to wastage of resources due to
 under-utilisation of capacity in hotels and lodges, inter-
.national conference centres, and on the international
 airline seats available on flights to Nairobi and
 Mombasa.
    For a country so famous for its people's hospitality,
 sandy beaches, deep blue skies, a snow-capped moun-
 tain, the breath-taking Rift Valley and incredible flora
 and fauna, getting less than 2 million visitors a year is
 untenable.
    Yet, with only 742,000 tourist arrivals, ,Kenya's
 income from tourism exceeded Sh24 billion ($300 mil-
 lion) in 2001, making the sector the second top foreign
 exchange earner, after tea, which raked in Sh35 billion.
 Global income from tourism, however, exceeds $476
 billion.
    Outlining the Narc Government's policy during the " "
  State Opening of the Ninth Parliament on February 18,
  President Mwai Kibaki said the tourism sector directly
  and indirectly creates almost 500,000 jobs. He said the
  sector had been plagued by negative publicity in the
  past due to many factors, including the ethnic c1as.hesat
  the Coast in the run-up to the 1997 General ElectIOn.
