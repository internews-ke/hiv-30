 the ominous message: 'Three people die every
 five minutes in Kenya frorp.Aids'.
    Followed to a logical mathematical conclu-

 every hour, 864 every 24 hours, 6,048 every
 week, 24,192 every month, 290,304 every year,
 and 1,451,520 every five years. Basically that
 about half of Nairobi's population could perish
 in five years.
    Mind-boggling figures, indeed! If this rate
 were to continue, and with our falling birth-
 rate, according to recently rel~ased govern-

 could be wiped out in a few short years.
