       Today we mark the World Aids Day, recognizing                                                                                 I would like to acknowledge and commend the
       that the battle against the scourge is yet to be won.                                                                        efforts made by the World Health Organization, in

       It is disheartening to leam that five million people
       became infected this year alone and a further three                                                                          iwould  also like to thank other organ;"zations, like

     But all over the world, prevention remains infinitely better than all known attempts
     at cure. Prevention calls for the greatest self-discipline, the greatest care and

     Inexorable march of the HIV/Aids holocaust.                                                We must fight this menace together as Kenyans. We must stop looking at it as an
