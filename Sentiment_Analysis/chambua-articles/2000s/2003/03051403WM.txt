{"text": "\ufeffDaily Nation/ May 14, 2003\r\nDaughter cuts off help for man who stopped wedding\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I wanted a man in my life, and one thing led to\r\nanother. I met the man in my life, and he accepted\r\nme. We decided to marry,\" she says. But when she\r\nmentioned the matter to Ogendo, he would have\r\nnone of it.\r\n\"Realising that my father was adamant, I asked\r\nmy love to move in with me as we planned a civil\r\nwedding. My father then sent a group of people to\r\nmy house to terrorise me and intimidate my husband,\"\r\nsays the nurse.\r\n\"Our love was growing from strength to strength,\r\nwe went to the DC's office in Kisii, where we\r\napplied to be married, giving the mandatory 21-day\r\nnotice.\r\n\"Since I was busy, I requested my fiancee to go\r\nto the DC's office to confirm that everything was\r\njust fine. He returned with good news from the district\r\nclerk, that all was well,\" says the bride.\r\nThe couple then hired vehicles and shopped for\r\nthe big day, but there was to be no ceremony. District\r\nOfficer Christopher Musumbu turned them\r\naway, saying that the bride might be somebody's\r\nwife.\r\nIt was crushing. After a two-hour wait, the couple\r\nstormed out of the DO's office and posed for\r\npictures outside for the benefit of curious civil servants\r\ngawking at them.\r\nAs they marched to their car, the bride\r\nremarked: \"This was a private maller. Why did [the\r\nDO] have to consult my father? I know my father\r\nwants to deny me my conjugal rights by measuring\r\nthe amount of love I should have, from whom and\r\neven how.\r\n\"I cannot succumb to his intimidation. He has\r\nstopped our marriage but that will not stop me\r\nfrom staying with the man I love,\" she said.\r\nMusumbu had advised the couple to swallow\r\nseek out the old man and try to reconcile with him.\r\nIf they could find Sh 10.000 for Ogendo, perhaps he\r\nwould attempt to reconcile them and perform the\r\nceremony if they returned to see him the following\r\nMonday.\r\nThe couple did not show up on the appointed\r\nday, but Ogendo, his wife Nyabengeye, and the\r\ndead man's brother, Oseti Getenga, were at the\r\nDO's office long before nine o'clock.\r\nAfter waiting for several hours, the DO asked\r\nthem to leave. He would send for them, he said.\r\nIt was then that Nyabengeye and Oseti made new\r\ndemands that the couple should first test results for\r\nHIV, and if they were uninfected, then Ogendo\r\ncould accept any dowry paid and agree to perform\r\nany ceremonies to cancel the \"first marriage\".\r\nSpe.aking from her work station, the bride said\r\nthis week: \"I have my life to lead and I want to forget\r\nthe disturbances caused by the two families as\r\nsoon as possible.\"\r\nOseti, for his part, says the Getenga family is\r\nready to welcome their estranged daughter-in-law\r\nback and forgive her for \"embarrassing our late\r\nbrother\".\r\n\"I will not allo~ her to remarry but can decide to\r\nstay with any man bearing in mind that if she dies,\r\nshe will be buried ather marital home in Bomachoge.\r\nBut the nurse has better ideas: \"I will move to\r\ncourt to block my father from interfering in my life.\r\nThen I will seek protection of my rights as any\r\nother human being.\"\r\nAccording to the Gusii customs, any married\r\nwoman whose dowry had been paid remains the\r\nwife of the dead man unless the dowry paid was\r\nreturned with approval from both parents.\r\nThe marriage saga is the talk of Kisii. Gladys\r\nAtambo, who is studying law at Moi University,\r\nsupports the woman's determination to marry but\r\nadvises that she first seeks reconciliation with her\r\nfather before her marriage.\r\n\"All laws tend to respect customary marriages,\r\nand to avoid court embarrassment, she should go\r\nthe extra mile and try to convince her father about\r\nthis marriage,\" she says.\r\nAlternatively, the woman could raise the dowry\r\nand have her new father in-law deliver it to the\r\nGetenga home, then formalise her marriage.\r\nSheila Njoki, who works as a salonist, sees mischief\r\nin'Ogendo's allempts to block his daughter's\r\nmarriage. She reserves her harshest words for the\r\nadministrator who declined to officiate the marnage.\r\nWilliam Obara, 72, says Ogendo was right to\r\ndecline the dowry before the first marriage was\r\nannulled. He warns that in case of death, the widow\r\nwill be buried at her first matrimonial home,\r\naccording to Gusii traditions.\r\nObara sees a way out for the couple: The new inlaws\r\nshould pay twice the dowry Ogendo received\r\nand plead with him to give them his daughter.\r\nOn the new demand for an HIV test, Pastor\r\nStanley Nyachienga of the SDA church says couples\r\nshould voluntarily take the Aids test.\r\n\"With the high rate of infection of the killer disease,\r\nit is for their own benefit that the couples first\r\ngo for HIV/Aids tests before tying the knot:' he\r\nsays."}
