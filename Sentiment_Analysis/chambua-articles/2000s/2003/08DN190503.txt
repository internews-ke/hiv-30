 Arms: This find is terrifying

     We may occasionally be diverted, as we are now, by the
  scare of international terrorists in our midst ready and willing
  make us victims of conflicts that do not concern us.
     But, on a daily basis, the real terror for the majority of
  Kenyans lies in a state where heavily armed criminals
  operate with utmost callousness and impunity.
     This is not to say that New York, London, Rome,
  Johannesburg, Paris and other global capitals of commerce
  and industry are any safer than Nairobi and other major
  Kenyan towns. Indeed, depending on which side of town one
  visits, Nairobi could be safer than most world capitals.
     But there is no denying the fact that progressively, we are
  losing the war against the domestic terrorists who rob, loot,
 rape and plunder almost unchallenged.
     Whether it is carjackers and armed robbers in urban areas
 or heavily-armed bandit gangs in the remoter areas of the
 country, one gets the impression that our criminal classes
 have, over the years, graduated from rungus, pangas and
 spears to the most sophisticated small arms.
     Those in the know confirm that in Eastleigh, Kawangware,
 Githurai and some other parts of Nairobi, buying or renting
 an assault rifle or a pistol is almost as simple as picking up a                                                                                   RETIREMENT BILL 0 JULIUS SUNKULI

 and eastern Kenya, arms bazaars that can even provide
 rocket launchers are said to do thriving business.                                                              State cannot prescribe behaviour
     So what does all that have to with Kenya's oldest centre of
 higher education?

 of inquiry, research and scholarship. But it is also a                                                                     he current debate in Kenya is
