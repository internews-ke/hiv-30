   Helping children
   cope with their
   HIV/Aids status
  By Patrick Nzioka
            hat happens in a child's early years
   W          influences how his childhood and
              adolescence will unfold. A sound
              start requires sound nutrition,
    healthcare, a hygienic home and community
    environment and play.
    HIV/Aids, however, is undermining all this.
    Today's children - defined by the UN Con-
    vention on the Rights of the Child as people
    under 18 - grow up in an Aids world.
    "They have to cope not only with longstand-
    ing problems that are just now being revealed
    by HIV/Aids but also with those resulting
    directly from the epidemic and which, until
    recently, people had to face only as adults."
    That is taken from The role of the Committee
    on the Rights of the Child and its impact on
    HIVIAids, a document by WHO's global pro-
    gramme on Aids presented at an Asian-
    Pacific Regional conference in Bangkok in
    November 1995.                                                                                                                                \
    The programme estimates that, over the last
    five years, HIV/Aids has killed 3.8 million
    children. More than 13 million under 15 have
    lost one or both parents to HIV/Aids.
                                By 2010, one third
                                of black African
     Reactions                  children under 15
