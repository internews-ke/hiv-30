 menu of harshly discordant voices from too many of its
 central committees.
     But that may be a false impression created by the media.
 In their sweet tooth for the negativism that tingles the senses,
 they may have ignored some hard - but probably slow and
 tedious - negotiations which, nevertheless, cover a great
 deal of positive ground.
    Archbishop David Gitari is well-situated to know. The
 former head of Kenya's chapter of the Anglican Church is a
 member of the legislative committee, which reportedly has,
 more or less, completed its work.
     So the talk about the conference being about to break up
 must be both surprising and dismaying to him, That is why he
 feels constrained to reassure Kenyans that these
 all-important talks are still very much on course.
     On Sunday, the prelate reaffirmed that a lot of ground had
 been covered at Bomas. Inside sources, indeed, reported

 disagreement,  for instance, over the defence needs. And
 everyone knows what a Bill of Rights should look like.                                     ~fonly thesefolk would pipe down!
    Much more emotion is evoked in such areas as the
 Executive, the Judiciary, local government (devolution) and
 land, because many of the negotiators imagine - rightly or
 wrongly - that a personal stake is involved.
                                                                                                              mbassador        Bethuel        • It is as                                       relaxed settings where misunderstandings
