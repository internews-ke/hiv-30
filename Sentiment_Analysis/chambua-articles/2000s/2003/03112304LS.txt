{"text": "\ufeffSunday Nation November 23, 2003\r\nFRIGHTENING STATISTICS RELATING TO HIV/AIDS\r\n\r\nBy Mungai Kihanya\r\n\r\nLet's talk about sex ... and Aids.\r\n. There are 45 million people living with\r\nHIV in the world today. A year ago, the\r\nnumber was 40 million. That gives an increase of\r\nfive million new victims in one year. In other\r\nwords, 30 more people will contract the virus by\r\nthe time you finish reading this article.\r\nIn Kenya, about 3 million people are HIVpositive.\r\nLast year there were 500,000 new infections.\r\nEvery day, 800 people die from Aids-related\r\nillnesses. One Kenyan will die of Aids by the time\r\nyou are through with this article ... and two more\r\nwill contract HIV!\r\nNow, there are about 20 million Kenyans aged\r\nbetween 15 and 49 years. Out of these, three million\r\nare HIV positive, leaving only 17 million that\r\nare negative.\r\nNow, the number of new infections grows exponentially.-\r\nThat is, the greater the number of HIVpositive\r\npeople, the greater the rate of increase.\r\nThis trend is made clear by these figures:\r\n\u2022 In 2002, the number of HIV positive Kenyans\r\nincreased by 500,000 from 2.5 million to 3 million.\r\n\u2022 In 2003, the figure will rise by 600,000 to 3.1\r\nmillion. Next year, the increment will be 720,000\r\nmaking a total of 3.8 million HIV carriers.\r\n\u2022 The year. 2005 will see 860,000 new infections\r\nbringing the total to 4.6 million.\r\nIf the trend continues, all adults in Kenya will be\r\nHIV positive at the end of 2013. And, since children\r\nof HIV positive mothers are also infected, it is\r\neasy to see that all Kenyans, young and old, will be\r\nHIV positive in the next 10 years.\r\nThese numbers are frightening ... but there is\r\nmore:\r\nThe World Health Organisation estimates that\r\nover 90 per cent of adult HIV case~ in developing\r\ncountries contract the virus through heterosexual\r\ncontact. In Kenya, this means that at least 400,000\r\npeople got the virus from unprotected sex last year.\r\nNow, how easily does one get the virus through\r\nunprotected sex?\r\nResearchers from Erusmus University in Rotterdam,\r\nNetherlands, and Princeton University in the\r\nU~~ have found that the probability of HIV transmISSIon\r\nthrough unprotected heterosexual intercourse\r\nvaries from 0.1 per cent to 4 per cent.\r\nDuring t~e first 10 weeks after contracting HIV,\r\nthe probabIlIty that the carrier will transmit the\r\nvirus to a heterosexual partner is 4 per cent (man\r\nto woman) and 2 per cent (woman to man). After\r\nthis phase, the body will develop some resistance\r\nthat brings down the transmission probabilities to\r\n0.2 per cent and 0.1 per cent respectively.\r\nLe~ us put these figures in perspective: Working\r\nthe hIgher transmission probability of 4 per cent, it\r\nturns ,?ut. that if 100 HIV -positive men were to\r\nengage in unprotected sex with 100 HIV-negative\r\nwomen, four of the women would contract the\r\n:virus..\r\nSo far this year, over 500,000 Kenyans have contracted\r\n.J-flV through unprotected sex. Using the\r\nprobabIlIty of 4 per cent, it is easy t6 work out the\r\ntotal number of unprotected sexual contacts with\r\nHIV-positive partners in the country. This is (100/\r\n4) x 500,000 = 12.5 million.\r\n\r\nmungai.kihanya@iet.co.ke"}
