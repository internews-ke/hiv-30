                                     BIVI AIDS Cam.-aign: Operation Stay Alive
                                                                  EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST
                                     Communication and Public Relations Services
       The Ministry of Health IS seeking Expressions of Interest (EO/) from suitably qualified agencies for
       Communications, Public Relations and Resource Mobilisation Services for the "Operation Stay Alive
       campaign". This is an HIV/AIDS initiative to promote a positive approach to the fight against HIV/AIDS, in
       support of the National HIV/AIDS Communication Strategy implementation.
       In this campaign, the Minis.try of Health targets young people aged 12-25, HIV free (Negative) Kenyan
       population and people already living with the virus. The campaign is geared towards initiating an integrated
       range of activities to facilitate HIV/AIDS, prevention, care and support across all provinces in the republic of
       Kenya.                          I
       The Ministry currently provi~es a wide range of services such as Voluntary counselling and testing (VCT),
       prevention of parent to child transmission (PTCT), condom programmes, behaviour change communication,
       treatment for sexually transmitted and opportunistic infections, blood safety, among others.
       This campaign is critical to the delivery of these services as it will provide new information on the risks of
       HIV/AIDS, and increase knowledge and motivate target groups to abstain from sex, live more positively with
       HIV/AIDS, actively engage in risk reduction behaviours and efforts to remain HIV negative. The campaign
       will also aim to expand on issues related to treatment, care and support of people living with HIV/AIDS, and
       people adversely affected by the impact of the pandemic.                                         '
        It is envisaged that the campaign will utilise a multidimensional approach, incorporating electronic, print
        media activities. The agenc~ will be expected to assist the ministry in mobilising resources for an additional
        range of activities in parthership with private sector, philanthropists, NGO'S and community based
        organisations for scaling up:an integration into the national campaign.
       Interested agencies may submit EOI documentation for the provision of services to the· National AIDS &
       Sexually Transmitted Infections Programmes (NASCOP) for the services. Submissions can be made by
       individual agencies, or in collaboration with partner' agencies. Agencies may obtain information on the
       specific services required by NASCOP and selection criteria by contacting:
                                                         ,
        The Director, National AIDS & STDs Control Programme - NASCOP Building, KNH Ground, Nairobi.
        Tel 2729549/02, Facsimile 2710518
       Expressions of Interest must be delivered and placed into the NASCOP tender Box by
