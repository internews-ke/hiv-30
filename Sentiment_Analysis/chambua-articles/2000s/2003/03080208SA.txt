Meanwhile, his\r\nyoung victim will be condemned to carry the scars for life,\r\nAnd more.\r\n    For Julius Lemeno Lukumani is not guilty just of\r\ndefilement. He also carries the virus that causes Aids. As\r\nMombasa Resident Magistrate Faith Maithya noted, the\r\naccused }ViIIhave condemned his young victim to a\r\npremature and painful death if she contracts the virus.\r\n    The magistrate added that, in defiling the girl, the accused\r\n was doing much more than satisfying his lust; he was\r\n maliciously exposing the innocent young girl to the HIV virus.\r\n If so, then even the charge of defilement means he was getting\r\n away with a slap on the wrist. He should have been charged\r\n with attempted murder.\r\n    Other Commonwealth jurisdictions have successfully, under\r\n their existing laws, set precedents. A wide latitude is given to\r\n interpretation of the law. Nowhere in the statutes is the mode\r\n of murder or attempted murder specified,\r\n    It might be defined, in the layman's terms, as deliberately\r\n and maliciously depriving or attempting deprive another                                                                                                                  DAVID MAKALI\r\n person of life.

Lessons from Goldenberg probe\r\n    Any HIV-positive person who plans and executes the crime\r\n of rape or defilement surely also knows that he is exposing his\r\n victim to HIV-Aids and death.\r\n     In fact, even in cases of consent, similar considerations\r\n would apply where one partner is unaware of the other's                                                          thrilling investigative movie has                                                        question to ponder is just how much greed\r\n carrying the virus,                                                                                                                                     a critical stage,\r\n                                                                                                     A                                                   The Goldenberg\r\n HIV-positive status.
