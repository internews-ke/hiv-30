After all, we are treated daily to a\r\n T      o the naked eye, it appears certain that the        .\r\n         constitutional review conference in Nairobi is not\r\n menu of harshly discordant voices from too many of its\r\n central committees.\r\n     But that may be a false impression created by the media.\r\n In their sweet tooth for the negativism that tingles the senses,\r\n they may have ignored some hard - but probably slow and\r\n tedious - negotiations which, nevertheless, cover a great\r\n deal of positive ground.\r\n    Archbishop David Gitari is well-situated to know. The\r\n former head of Kenya's chapter of the Anglican Church is a\r\n member of the legislative committee, which reportedly has,\r\n more or less, completed its work.\r\n     So the talk about the conference being about to break up\r\n must be both surprising and dismaying to him, That is why he\r\n feels constrained to reassure Kenyans that these\r\n all-important talks are still very much on course.\r\n     On Sunday, the prelate reaffirmed that a lot of ground had\r\n been covered at Bomas. Inside sources, indeed, reported\r\n Bill of Rights.\r\n ye.sterday that some other committees had also nearly                                    -\r\n finished their work, including defence, public finance and the\r\n    Granted, these are areas which do not, as a rule, cause too                                                                      NARC IN CRISIS 0 MACHARIA GAITHO\r\n much controversy in policy-making. There can be no\r\n disagreement,  for instance, over the defence needs. And\r\n everyone knows what a Bill of Rights should look like.                                     ~fonly thesefolk would pipe down!\r\n    Much more emotion is evoked in such areas as the\r\n Executive, the Judiciary, local government (devolution) and\r\n land, because many of the negotiators imagine - rightly or\r\n wrongly - that a personal stake is involved.\r\n                                                                                                              mbassador        Bethuel        \u2022 It is as                                       relaxed settings where misunderstandings\r\n    No wonder that these are the areas in which the\r\n conference seems bogged down.
