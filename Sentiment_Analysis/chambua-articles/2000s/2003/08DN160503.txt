        esterday's conference on how to involve the private

development agenda.
   This country will never experience sustainable economic
recovery if telecommunication      services remain expensive, if
electricity supply remains unreliable and costly, and if goods
take weeks to be cleared at Kilindini.
   The economy cannot be turned around in situations where
importers and manufacturers are forced to rely on a poorly
maintained road network to transport intermediate goods
instead of using the cheaper rail transport.
   Due to the hopeless state of the roads, electricity network,
telecommunications      and urban infrastructure, Kenya has
retrogressed to the point where it is beginning to lose its
competitive edge over its trading partners in the Common
Market for Eastern Africa (Comesa).
   Thus, there is a strong case for putting infrastructure    high
on our agenda. The problem is how to raise the resources
required for the task. For the truth is that the Government
has no chance of raising even half the money needed.
   Yesterday, President Kibaki estimated at Sh203 billion the
level of investment required in three years. This figure is
more than what the Kenya Revenue Authority collects in                                                                             BETWEEN US 0 KWAMCHETSI MAKOKHA
