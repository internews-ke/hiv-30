The rioting, on t,he first day,\r\n                   prematurely ended the festival last Thursday. Every-\r\n                   thing was just getting into gear, when the students\r\n threw decency and decorum out of the window, causing mayhem in\r\n Eldoret Town and on the university's other campuses.\r\n     And, with the cancellation, went all the time, money and prepara-\r\n tions for the staging of plays, poetry and other theatrical\r\n performances.\r\n     \"'This is disappointing,\"   cried a theatre arts student who sought\r\n anonymity, fearing the wrath of the hooligans.\r\n     Before the abrupt end, only a few teams had performed on the\r\n  university's Eldoret West Campus. The event had started with a brief\r\n speech by Eldoret Mayor Jonah Maiyo, followed by performances by\r\n  the Moi University Choir, Creative Arts Department students and a\r\n  Luhya traditional dance group, Makale Band. A colourful procession\r\n  through the town was next, followed by a vigorous Nandi folk dance\r\n  by Mosoriot Teachers' College.\r\n     Moi University Choir entertained the guests with Zilizopendwa\r\n   (golden oldies). Conducted by Melitus Wanyama, the choir proved its\r\n   mettle with a good harmony of voices, instruments and choreography.\r\n      Student Irene Choge presented a poem on HIV/Aids, cautioning\r\n   youth against getting involved in sex with older people for money.\r\n      A demonstration     of martial arts and the'tug-of-war were next. It\r\n   was then that some students started demonstrating their expertise in\r\n   the negative arts of stone throwing and looting.\r\n      The chairman, Dr L.P. Barasa, and the other organisers met later in\r\n   the evening and called off the event. The other members of the team\r\n   are Basil Okong'o, Dr Joyce Agalo, Evans Mugarizi, Christopher\r\n    Odhiambo, and Dr Okumu Bigambo.\r\n  Marks.Cor-sex scandal\r\n  The cancellation denied the people of Eldoret a chance to watch\r\n  shows by top contemporary          dance troupes Kayamba Africa and\r\n  Cheche. The Presbyterian Church of East Africa's Eastleigh drama\r\n  group would have performed The Scourge, a play about a university\r\n  professor who infects students with HIV in a marks-for-sex scandal.\r\n      At the Grand Regency Hotel, Nairobi, there will be fun all day on\r\n  November 15, during the Swissgarde National Conference.
