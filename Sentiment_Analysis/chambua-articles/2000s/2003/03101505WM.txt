Many families were left\r\n      with no means of livelihood, leading to an exodus\r\n      to urban centres in search of employment. In the\r\n      towns the newcomers were forced to take low-\r\n     paying and exploitative jobs. As a result, many\r\n   \\ ended up as alcoholics and exposed themselves to\r\n   ; Aids and HIV infection.\r\n          Meanwhile, relief and government agencies have\r\n   \\ reported serious food shortages in Garfasa Loca-\r\n      tion of Garba TulIa Division, Gubatu in Sericho .\r\n      and Dadachabasa Location in Merti Division.

For Gubatu, the drought\r\n       is man-made.
