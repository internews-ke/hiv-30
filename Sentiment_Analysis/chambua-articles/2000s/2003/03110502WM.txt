{"text": "5-Nov-03\r\nFIGHTING HIV WITH A COMPASSION\r\nLucy wants to be a\r\nmother figure for\r\nthose who've been\r\ntouched by Aids\r\n\r\nCONTINUED FROM PAGE 1\r\nspouse be taken to court and jailed for abetting\r\n\"murder\".\r\nIt was at this function, held earlier this year, that\r\nKenyans first saw Lucy stamp her weighty presence\r\nin the fighting against HIV/Aids. Since then, she\r\nhas actively led various national and international\r\ncampaigns against the epidemic ..\r\nYet this is not a new cause she has taken up.\r\n,Even before she became First Lady, Lucy was qui-\r\netly involved in projects related to the anti-Aids\r\ncampaign.\r\n\"I assist orphanages directly and indirectly. For a\r\nlong time 1 have been involved in the campaign in a\r\nquiet way as 1 am not the ki~d of person who shows\r\noff every time 1give donations.\"\r\nShe has held Christmas parties for orphans in her ,\r\nMuthaiga home and assisted Aids orphans in vari-\r\nolis homes; including Nyumbani Children's Home.\r\nShe has seen several orphans through college and\r\nuniversity and is paying school fees for others.\r\nHer mission, she has declared, is to provide a\r\nmother figure for those infected or touched in one\r\nway or another by Aids, especially women and chil-\r\ndren, who are most affected by the pandemic.\r\n\"I am a mother to everyone, including widows,\r\nwidowers and orphans. Any time you need any-\r\nthing, just call me.\"\r\n\r\nEvery public function\r\nSince the VCT visit, she has talked about Aids at\r\nevery public function she has attended, and Ken-\r\nyans are opening up to her in her new role.\r\nAt a National Council of Women in Kenya fUnc-\r\ntion last week, women and children told her their,\r\nexpectations ..\r\nThe children, who were from Mathare slums,\r\nsang and recited poems about their predicament as\r\nAids orphans. Since they do not have parents, they\r\nsaid, they wanted Lucy to allow them to call her\r\n\"Mama\".\r\n\"After our parents die of Aids, we go to our aunt\r\nwho makes us beasts of burden and the neighbours\r\nrefuse to give us shelter. How happy we are now\r\nthat we have a caring mother.\"                    ,\r\nAs she listened to them, Lucy shed tears of sad-\r\nness. She was similarly moved to tears (as were\r\nother first ladies present) was when Joan Nyambu-\r\nra, a widow living with Aids, narrated her experi-\r\nence at the Organisation of First Ladies Against\r\nAids satellite conference during the recent Interna-\r\ntional Conference On Aids and Sexually Transmit-\r\nted Il)ness in Africa (ICASA) in Nairobi.\r\n. Mrs Kibaki accepted a request to be the first\r\n\r\n\r\npatron of the 39-year-old National Council of\r\n\r\nWomen in Kenya. It means she will serve as patron\r\nto 100 Non-Governmental Organisations and 1,000\r\n\r\ncommunity-based organisations, which are mem-\r\n\r\nbers of the council.\r\n\r\nHaving joined the organisation in 1970, the First\r\nLady knows the challenging work ahead. As the\r\n\r\npatron, she will be expected to represent the organ\r\n\r\nsation at international forums, but what is more\r\n\r\nimportant is her duty to voice the concerns of\r\nwomen at the highest office.\r\n\"Her being a patron is, for us, having someone\r\nassociated'with our [the women's] aspirations,\" says\r\nEast African MP Rose Waruhiu. \"It is a burden but\r\nwe know the burden has landed on caring shoul-\r\nders.\"\r\nThe First Lady is happy with her new role as this\r\nwill complement her other duties of uplifting the\r\nlives of Aids orphans and people living with Aids.\r\nAids is an economic disease and poverty has a\r\nwoman's face. The NCWK's vision of economically\r\nempowering women will go a long way to combat\r\nthe disease.\r\n\"I recommend the organisation for its campaign\r\nagainst domestic violence and harmful traditional\r\npractices like wife inheritance, which expose   -\r\nwomen to HIV/Aids.\"\r\n\r\nAcross the board\r\nLucy's role in the campaing against Aids is appreci-\r\nated across the board.\r\n\"She is like a flower. For a long time Kenyans\r\nknew that we were losing 700 people to Aids daily\r\nbut nobody bothered. Our dear lady has shown sen-\r\nsitivity and given us new hope,\" says nominated MP\r\nBetty Tett.\r\nFor the battle against Aids to succeed, says Lucy,\r\nKenyans must be ready to help her by talking about\r\nthe disease at the family table, at the pulpit, in the\r\nmedia and at all gatherings, including funerals and\r\nweddings. This, she says, will curb the spread of the\r\npandemic.\r\nShe has declared that she wants medical therapy\r\nfor those who haves Aids to prolong their lives so\r\nthat they can live long enough to take care of their\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n\r\ni-         With the First Lady's commitment to the cause of\r\n\r\nthose affected and infected by HIV/Aids, Kenya\r\n\r\nmay just be on the right track to winning the colos-\r\nsal battle ahead."}
