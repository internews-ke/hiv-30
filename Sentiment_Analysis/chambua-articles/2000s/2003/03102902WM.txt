{"text": "\ufeffDAILY NATION OCTOBER 29, 2003\r\n\r\nAMANI COUNSELLORS\r\nHow do I tellmy family that I ~ave HIV?\r\nDear A'mani,\r\nI am a single mother working as a senior officer\r\nin a government institution. I recently found\r\nout that I am mv-positive. Although I had suspectedit\r\nall along because of my frequent visits\r\nto hospital, the news was devastating.\r\nMy family holds me in very high esteem\r\nbecause I am one of the more stable members in\r\nthe family. My nine-year-old daughter and I are\r\nvery close. What is most worrying is how I will\r\nbreak the news to my daughter. What will happen\r\nto her when ~am gone'? My father is old and\r\nsickly. Will he be able to handle the news'?\r\nMaybe I should just keep it to myself and die\r\nqnietly. But I'm so lonely and confused. At my\r\nage and with my status, I ought to face reality.\r\nBut this kind of reality is too much to handle.\r\nPlease help me find some sanity and a way to\r\ndeal with it.\r\nAmani: It must have taken a lot of courage for\r\nyou to write to us about this overwhe'1ming experience.\r\nAs you have rightly put it, even though\r\nyou were suspicious, it has shaken you thoroughly.\r\nYou are surrounded by loving people and you\r\ndo not know how to break such painful news to\r\nthem. Yet you realise you cannot live with it\r\nalone. Sooner or later they wil1guess or know.\r\nYour worries about your daughter's ability to\r\nhandle such news and her welfare in future are\r\njustified; Although you have not stated it, you\r\nmig'nt also be worried about your job and the\r\nfinancial implications of your il1ness.\r\nNews about HIV is not just about sickness, but\r\nalso helplessness, hopelessness, pain, possible\r\n- rejection arid facing one's own death. When that\r\nkind of reality dawns on one, confusion, shock,\r\nbitterness and anger are some of the immediate\r\nreactions.\r\nHIV/Aids kills very slowly, but surely, a reality\r\nthat is too much for any normal person to handle.\r\nThat is why many people choose to deny it or\r\nignore it until the syndrome gets the better of\r\nthem. Our brains are wired in such a way that\r\nthey can handle a certain amount pain, threat or\r\nchallenge. But when any of these is too much for\r\nthe brain, we activate defence mechanisms to\r\nhelp us move on. One of these is suppression or\r\ndissociation so that it is no longer in our conscious\r\nmind. However, it will continue to disturb\r\nus and inhibit our functioning in life. In other\r\nwords, one may push it to the back of the mind\r\nuntilit is too late.\r\nHaving accepted your HIV positive status this\r\nearly is very good for you because you wil1be\r\nable to address the many issues surrounding this\r\nfact. You have raised a number of these in your\r\nletter. You come from a close-knit family where\r\nmembers are interested in each others' welfare.\r\nNo wonder you are devastated by the complexity\r\nof your problem and dilemma. You want them to\r\nknow but you fear the effect the news will have\r\non them, especially your father and daughter.\r\nYoualso seem to understand the implications of\r\nyour HIV-status and the progress of the-disease.\r\nHowever, from your letter, you seem to be more\r\nconcerned about your loved ones than yourself.\r\nThat'is not unusual.\r\nIt is important for you to accept that your ill-\r\nness has no cure and that it attacks your immune 'I\r\nsystem so that your body is unable to fight dis- I\r\nease. However, it is also important for you to I\r\nknow that you can live for a very long time after\r\nyou are inJected. This will depend on hew you\r\nhandle yourself, your family and people at your\r\nplace of work. Unlike in the past, today we have\r\nmany support systems for people living with -\r\nnot dying from - Aids. You do not have to\r\nstruggle alone.\r\nYou sound like a very strong and influential\r\nperson. Being educated, you can keep yourself\r\ninformed about the disease and monitor your\r\nown progress.\r\nSupport system\r\nSecondly, your family closeness is a strong asset\r\nin building an understanding and loving support\r\nsystem. You can even discuss the future of your\r\ndaughter with them. Thirdly, you have an\r\nopportunity to organise your finances and ensure\r\nthat all your possible benefits are put in place. [\r\nthink you have a lot going for you.\r\nFollowing are some practical steps you might\r\nwant to take to move forward:\r\n-Break the silence by sharing news of your HIVstatus\r\nwith a close friend or relative, in strict confidence.\r\nAt the moment, it sounds like only your\r\ndoctor is aware. You can discuss with him/her\r\nhow to go about this.\r\n.Depending on your health and your daughter's\r\nperception of it, you need to decide on when and\r\nhow to break the news to her. Whatever the case,\r\nit is best that you do it yourself, because she\r\nneeds to have a lot of reassurance. If other peomarried\r\npie break the news to her, it might devastate her.\r\n.Although it is not easy to be positive in your\r\nattitude to the issues surrounding your il1ness, if\r\nyou can, join a support group where you can\r\nlearn to share with others experiences of your\r\nstruggles at each stage of the disease. Such a\r\ngroup wil1empower you and even encourage you\r\nbecause you will meet others who are in worse\r\nsituations than you.\r\n\u2022 Depending on how you relate with members of\r\nyour family, discuss with one of them how to\r\nbreak the news to your father and the rest of the\r\nfamily. These are the ones who will walk with\r\nyou all the way.\r\n.If and when it becomes necessary, you will need\r\nto disclose your HIV status to the relevant person\r\nin your place of work. This has to be done\r\nvery cautiously. I.\u2022 Continue with your normal life for as long as\r\nI you are able to.\r\n.Tak.e.care of you: health by eating properly and\r\nexercISIng appropnately.\r\n.Discuss with your doctor the right antiretroviral\r\ndrugs for your case and use them.\r\nAll this may be easier said than done.
