AIDS CENSUS, SAYS WHO

ENVOY ACCUSES WEST OF DOING LITTLE FOR AFRICA

By Julius Bosire.
The UN has blamed the West for failing
to direct enough resources to Africa's
fight against HIV /Aids.
The UN secretary general's special
envoy for Africa, Mr Stephen Lewis,
said the West was spending a lot of
resources to fight terrorism while they
channelled little to take care of children
orphaned by Aids.
"Africa needs no instructions from
the West; Africa needs no arrogance
from the West; Africa needs no churlish
lectures from the West. Africans know
HIV/Aids in all its manifestation and
requirements," Mr Lewis said.
He was addressing the 13th Interna- .
tional Conference on Aids and Sexually
Transmitted Infections in Africil(ICASA)
at the Kenyatta International
Conference.
He said no one in the world had
developed a plan to cope with the millions
of children orphaned by Aids.
The knowledge and human resources,
he said, were in Africa, including
organisations of people living with
Aids, inspired youth peer counsellors,
political and religious leadership, activist
women's groups and a sophisticated
strength on the continent.
"What is missing are the tools and
support to do the job. Provide those to
Africa, and we can break the back of
this pandemic," Mr Lewis said.
He said despite all odds, with those
orphaned by Aids becoming young parents,
Africans were determined to save
the continent. Orphaned children was
the most vexing issue related to care
because there were no enough adults to
look after the children, he said.
Meanwhile, the World Bank warns
that HlV/Aids causes greater long-term
damage to national economies than
previously assumed.
Its latest research says that by killing
young adults, the disease was robbing
the children of victims of Aids one or
both parents to love and educate them.
This undermines the basis of economic
growth in the long run.


STATE URGED TO ESTABLISH DRUG PROCUREMENT CENTER

By Nation Team

The Government should consider setting
up a procurement centre to enable
Aids patients buy cheaper drugs.
A joint report by Medecins sans
Frontieres and the World Health
Organisation says that Kenya could
expand access by including Iifeprolonging
Aids drugs, commonly
known as anti-retrovirals, in the existing
national drug distribution system as
Cameroun has done.
Says the report: "In Kenya, where
more than 2.2 million are infected by
Aids, generic ARVs are used in the
non-profit sector including MSF
projects. "
Approximately 800 people are receiving
treatment in MSF projects in Homa
Bay, Busia and Nairobi where the
organisation, is paying $292 per patient
per year.
However, to date, these lower cost
medicines are only available through
limited non-profit distribution and are
not available through a national procurement
centre, says the report entitled
Surmounting challenges: Procurement
of Anti·retroviral medicines in low
and middle· income countries.
Last week, the Government launched
a national programme to provide drugs
to patients in public hospitals.
The programme, under which the
Government has set aside Sh150 million,
will initially benefit 6,000 patients.
Ms Sophie-Marie Scouflaire, the lead
author of the MSFIWHO report says:
"In the 10 countries profiled in the
report it has been possible to supply
low cost quality ARVs to MSF projects
but in many cases lack of a government
procurement strategy has meant that .
MSF had set-up supply channels
in-country."


FIRST LADIES DEMAND LAWS TO CURB VIRUS

African First Ladies yesterday
challenged governments to
enact laws which will protect
couples from philandering
partners.
Addressing a satellite conference on
the HIV/Aids pandemic, the First
Ladies of Uganda, Guinea, Rwanda
and Kenya expressed concern that
women, particularly in the rural areas,
were more vulnerable to their unfaithful
partners who infected them with
sexually transmitted diseases and the
Aids virus.
Through their Organisation of African
First Ladies Against HIV/Aids (OAFLA),
the First Ladies called on women
lawyers to come up with a law to protect
women and children from unfaithful
husbands who infect their wives
with the Aids virus.
"We must stop this. Even God has
made adultery a sin to prevent a
spouse from infecting
their partner," said
Uganda's Janet Museveni.
The First Ladies said it
was time Africans recognised
the enormity of the
problem, accept its magnitude
and surmount the
many difficulties ahead in combating
its spread.
They said the first step towards combating
the disease's spread was by
frankly talking about unprotected and
irresponsible sex, its impact, the HIV/
Aids disease and other issues regarded
by most African communities as taboo.
"Now is the time to talk about HIVI
Aids at the family table, at the pulpit,
in the media and at all gatherings
including funerals and weddings. We
must curb the spread of the pandemic,"
said Mrs Lucy Kibaki.
Mrs Kibaki was optimistic that even
with limited resources, the continent
could overcome the devastation of the
Aids pandemic.
"People, especially women and girls,
should have the freedom, the power
and the knowledge to make decisions
about their health," she said.
The conference, whose theme is Empowering
girls and women in the fight
against HlVlAids, noted that while
everyone was vulnerable to getting
Aids, the poor were more at risk.
"Now is the time for every government
in Africa to integrate anti-retrovirals in
therapies to prolong lives of the infected.
That is the only way that infected
parents can live long enough to take
care of their children," the First Ladies
said.
Mrs Museveni challenged other African
countries to follow the Ugandan
example where the government
acknowledged the threat posed by the
disease early enough and took measures
to curb its spread.
"We moved from fear, panic and
denial to commitment and action and
now to renewed commitment," MIS
Museveni told delegates at the conference
which ends today.
It happened at a time when her country
was least prepared. Uganda had
just come out of a protracted civil war
and the country's main objective was
recq~truction and rebuilding the
country which was in a shambles.
"We were less p't~ared when it hit us.
&uHwo decades later
HIV/Aids is contained
<111 Uganda."
With a nati
Ience rateq
cent a~d 11~
cent in other .~
Uganda has th€ eS1~'"
incidence of Aids in
sub-Saharan Africa.
"This gives us hope that the scourge
can be contained."
Uganda used all available platforms to
raise the alarm on HIV/Aids and the
sensitisation in the country is 100 per
cent. First sex encounter has risen
from age 14 to 18, said Mrs Museveni.
"Everyone must be told that they and
only they can change their behaviour
and practice in the face of Aids and
death," she said.
Rwanda's First Lady Jeannette Kagame
said OAFLA's role was to catalyse
actions geared towards treatment
of opportunistic diseases and to work
With other agencies such as the United
Nations to contain the disease.
"We know what needs to be done but
there is need for mobilisation to support
programmes to fight Aids."
Other countries like Cameroon, Zambia,
Benin, South Africa and Burkina
Faso sent representatives. Later, the
First Ladies held a fundraising dinner
to advance their campaign for effective
:.s~rategies to eradicate stigma and dis-.
Ctimination of people infected·ana .
affected by HIVI Aids.
