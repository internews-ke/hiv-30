Poor knowle( ge of the scripture\r\naggravates the plight of Muslim women - many\r\ndo not know their rights. Men subjugate women\r\nby either ignoring holy guidelines on relationships\r\nor interpreting them to suit mal,~dominance.\"\r\nHIV/Aids and women sexuality is another key\r\narea of concern for Nazlin. She is the secretary to\r\nthe Regional Inter-Religious HIV/Aids Network\r\nin Africa and represents the Mlslim community in\r\nthe gender committee of It e National Aids\r\nControl Council (Nacc). She i~ a member of the\r\neditorial task force in thecoun :il. She sits on the\r\nexecutive steering com nittee of the\r\nInter-Religious Aids ..Conso \u00b7tium (Irac), an\r\norganisation that brings togethe r faiths combating\r\nthe scourge.\r\nForced to leave school for mam Ige\r\nPersonal trauma and sufferinl: has encouraged\r\nNazlin to root for women's c,tUses. For all her\r\nambition to pursue formal I:ducation to the\r\nhighest level, she was forced to curtail school at\r\nOrdinary-Level. Her parents encouraged her to\r\nmarry early, her father insisti 19 she needed a\r\nhusband to assure her protecti on. The old man\r\nhad asked her husband to allow her to pursue\r\nfurther education later. \"The pomise, if real, was\r\nlost in the rigours of motterhood,\" Nazlin\r\nlaments.\r\n\"I decided not to let my failure to access\r\nadvanced education hamper my life. I spend a tidy\r\nsum of my earnings on books. I may not have the\r\nuniversity papers, but I am determined to bridge\r\nthe knowledge gap through read ng.\" She says trauma is co nmon in Muslim\r\n\u2022\r\nwomen. Many of them are tortured and\r\n. forced to commit suicide in the name of\r\nmaintaining family ho lOUr.\r\n\"Aggrieved 'Women suffer the illusion\r\nthat fighting for thei r rights is being\r\ndisrespectful to their husbands. :Jthers are afraid\r\nthat if they agitate for their rigl ts, their morality\r\nwould be put to question. Most women shy away\r\nfrom rigorous pursuit of their rights. The men\r\nknow this only too well and tak e full advantage.\r\nCall her a prostitute, and sh,: buckles under\r\nshame.\"\r\nThe practice of polygamy didnely granted in\r\n'Islam is a recipe for spreading th,; disease within a\r\nMuslim family, she says. This does not begrudge\r\nthe cause for polygamy she reaso 1S.It is necessary\r\nthat husbands should insist on Hiv test before\r\nundergoing nuptials with new brides. The spouses\r\nshould routinely undergo the test to ascertain their\r\nvirus status.\r\nOn the scourge, she says: \"A nong Asian and\r\nother Muslims, there is a steady r se in the number\r\nof infections. The situation is conpounded by the\r\ntaboo status of the disease in the particular group.\r\nThen there is the fallacy of Mlslims being less\r\nexposed to Aids. Because the di ;ease is believed\r\nto ravage the Sub-Saharan region thus sparing the\r\npredominant Muslim North, Kenyan Muslims are\r\nencouraged by a false sense of immunity. Why areWhy are\r\nnoring the many Muslims in the sub.Saharan\r\nwho could as well corn rise a sizeable\r\ni of the infected?\u201d\r\nNo longer tenable to confine them\r\n,fi; Being a vocal advocate for women's rights in the\r\n:;, patriarchal Asian and Islamic communities has not\r\nbeen easy. \"Although a good number of our men,\r\nin principle, support the idea of i wolving women\r\nfully in decision-making, a m.ljority are not\r\ncomfortable with a woman's kadership. They\r\nwonder why, for instance, I sh(luld issue press\r\n'f releases in the name of Supkem. Who mandated\r\nme to talk? Where are the men who should be\r\nrepresenting them?\"\r\nWomen Muslims are now playir g active roles in\r\nfinancial and material support for their families. It\r\nis no longer tenable to confin: them to the\r\nkitchen.\r\nNazlin walked out of a marrilge because of\r\n\"irreconcilable differences\" with the father of her\r\nfour children.\r\n\"When a Muslim woman is divorced, she is a\r\nsocial outcast and nobody wants to give her a\r\nhearing. The harsh verdict is that there is\r\nsomething wrong with your character. If you\r\ncannot perform the simple task of being\r\nsome body's wife, at least, you should have the\r\n'decency' to shut up or make yourself invisible.\r\nThey do not take it kindly if you insist on serving\r\npublic roles. They think you are the wrong\r\nmessenger. \"\r\nHer resolve not to let subjective opinion weigh\r\nher down has borne fruit. Critics are no longer as\r\npersonal and harsh as they used to be. Support by\r\nformer Supkem secretary-general Ahmed Khalif\r\n(now deceased), the chairman of the Council of\r\nImams and the Chief Kadhi has kept her hostile\r\ncritics at bay.\r\nNazlin, a fourth-generation Kenyan of Persian\r\norigin, is a senior producer for the Islamic radio\r\nstation, Iqra, where she hosts a weekly radio talk\r\nshow on Islam and women.\r\nHer earnest studies in Islam began in 1979, at St\r\nTerasa Girls High School in Eastleigh, Nairobi,\r\nwhere she volunteered to teach fellow Muslim\r\nstudents the Quran. \u201cThere began my passion for\r\nthe holy book.\u201d\r\nShe spices her conversation with quotes from\r\nauthoritative books on such issues as the\r\nArab-Israel conflict, the IMF1 World Bank\r\neconomic reforms in poor countries and their\r\neffects on women and children, and the West\r\nconnection in the Aids pandemic.\r\nApproaching your partner like a donkey\r\nShe abhors domestic violence that she considers\r\ncompletely outlawed in the scriptures. \u201cOnly the\r\nweak-minded men or women of little intelligence\r\nresort to violence. The Quran warns against\r\napproaching your partner like a donkey. Civility\r\nis encouraged. Blows and kicks are forbidden.\u201d\r\nNaziin has given lectures on Islam, women\u2019s\r\nrights and Aids at universities and other forums\r\nin America, South Africa and Burkina Faso. She\r\nsays the worJd is steeped in ignorance on Islam\r\nand women\u2019s rights. She has published severa)\r\nbooks on these issues: Faith-Based Commwti:ies:\r\nResponse io Sexuality. Strategies, Ache\u2019emenb\r\nand Challenges in Our Response to H1V\r\nPandemic- The Islamic Perspective. The Truth of\r\nWomen in Islam.
