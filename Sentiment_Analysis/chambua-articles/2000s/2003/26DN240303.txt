                  The Big Challenge
                     Ten years ago, the World Health
                     Organisation declared tuberculosis as a
                     global emergency, in recognition of the
                     rapid resurgence of the disease across
                   'the world, fuelled mainly by the HIV!Aids •
                     epidemic. Members states and the
 international community were challenged to mobilise
 resources to aggressively fight the epIdemic. The key         ,
 weapon in our hands then and nowis the recommended
 "DOTS" strategy. "DOTS" had been proven to cure
 patients, save JIves, prevent the spread of drug resistant'
 TB and reduce the propagation of the ,disease.                ,
     Over the last 10 years, we have relentlessly promoted,
 the DOTS strategy among the member states in the               '
 African region and have achieved some successes,
 though there is still a lC?to. be done ..To date, at least 69,

  access to DOTS service yet only 44 per cent of active TB
  cases are being detected under the DOTS programmes,
  as oppo$ed to a global target of 70 per cent.
   , Of the 44 per cent being detected under DOTS, only                                                 A patient being observed taking drugs (DOTS) in a TB manyatta
