{"text": "\ufeffDaily Nationl December 3, 2003\r\nEVEN THE DEVIL HAS GOT TO LOVE ME\r\nSHE IS POSITIVE, BUT KAMUNDE'S SPIRITS ARE HER KEY TO GOOD HEALTH \r\n\r\nJane Kamunde is so positive about her HIV\r\nstatus that even the devil cannot stand in\r\nher way.\r\n\"Even the devil has to love me,\" she\r\ndeclares.\r\nSo full of life is she in her striking blue African\r\noutfit that it is difficult to imagine, even for a sec-\r\nond, that Kamunde is HIV-positive. Not even her\r\neyes betray her status, so full of sparkle are they.\r\nShe has the most contagious smile, and she is a lot\r\nof fun to talk to.\r\nKamunde was a ray of sunshine for the hundreds\r\nof people living with HIV who were at Charter Hall\r\nin Nairobi in August.\r\nWhile delegates from all over the world were dis-\r\ncussing problems related to HIV/Aids at the Keny-\r\natta International Conference (KICC) during the\r\nInternational Conference on Aids and Sexually\r\nTransmitted Diseases (Icasa) in August, Kamunde\r\nwas bringing hope to people living with the virus.\r\nHundreds of people living with HIV/Aids were in\r\nNairobi, hoping to make a statement with their\r\npresence at the international conference, but they\r\nhad a more pressing problem - their failing health,\r\nwhich would not allow many of them to\r\nparticipate fully in what was going on at KICC. But\r\nat Charter Hall they found help, in the form of\r\nmedical and medical and para-medical facilities that\r\nenabled them to cope with the vigours of the one-\r\nweek conference.\r\nKamunde contracted the disease in 2001, and she\r\nwas there to tell her story to inspire those who were\r\nsuffering.\r\n\"When my sick husband was diagnosed HIV-\r\npositive, I, too, wanted to know my status. What\r\nhad to happen happened, and I immediately started\r\ngoing forcounselling.\"\r\nMain house\r\nKamunde's in-laws showed no sympathy. She and\r\nher family were kicked out of the family house,\r\nwhere she has been living since her wedding. They\r\nwere given the servant's quarters, far from the main\r\n\r\nhouse, with only their personal items and cooking\r\nutensils. Even Kamunde's three children, who are\r\n\r\nHIV-free, were not spared.\r\n\r\n\"As if kicking us out was not enough, they\r\n\r\nwarned us never to set foot in the main house\r\n\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\nOne day when Kamunde went to seek help at the\r\n\r\nmain house in an emergency, she was horrified by\r\n\r\nher brother-in-Iaw's reaction.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want now? You want to spread\r\n\r\nyour disease to the whole family? Get out,\" he\r\n\r\nyelled. Kamunde was so distraught and furious that\r\n\r\nshe became a rebel with a good cause from that\r\n\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\"I said to myself, even the devil will have to\r\nchange his mind and love me for what I am.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, had it not been for her sister and.one\r\n\r\nvery good friend, it would have been difficult for\r\nher and her family to survive as her husband had to\r\n\r\nstop work by then.\r\n\"When I could not cope with my very sick hus-\r\n\r\nband, with my own health and my three growing\r\nchildren, my friend would take us all in her house\r\nand care for us. I believe in God and God is always\r\n\r\nlistening to my prayers.\"\r\nHaving no job, a sick husband and three children\r\n\r\nwas a big challenge for Kamunde.\r\n\r\n\"Stigma? What stigma?\" she asks. \"We are our\r\n\r\nown stigmas and we must undo that. We have so\r\n\r\nmany things to unlearn.\"\r\n\r\nKamunde believes that once a person accepts his\r\n\r\nor her HIV status\u00b7and decides to live a normal life,\r\n\r\nthe rest becomes very easy. And she kept on saying:\r\n\r\n\"Even the Devil will end up loving you.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Kamunde's husband died, she was ordered\r\n\r\nout of the servant's quarter.\r\n\r\n\"Of course I refused to go. I have lived with my\r\n\r\nhusband for 20 years. I have cared for my family\r\n\r\nand my in-laws before my HIV status. I will leave\r\nonly when I am ready and not because I am being\r\n\r\nordered. I have rights.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am in such high spirits that I don't even take\r\nanti-retrovirals. I believe in the Lord. I am on a bal-\r\n\r\nanced diet. I am on herbal medicine and whenever I\r\ncatch an opporturiistic disease I go for treatment.\r\n\r\nSometimes I have spinal pains but I am being\r\n\r\ntreated for that.\"\r\nKamunde's status has made of her not only a\r\n\r\nrebel, but a great social worker as well. She is\r\nactively involved with Pathfinder International,\r\n\r\nPopulation Services International (PSI). Kamunde\r\n\r\nhas been trained in home-based nursing skills and\r\n\r\nshe is now passing on these skills on to other people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLow esteem\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Because of my status, I get tired very quickly, so I\r\n\r\nprefer to train others to do the job.\"\r\nAlthough she is very committed to her work in\r\n\r\nthe different Non Governmental Organisations\r\n\r\n(NGOs), she holds NGO heads in low esteem.\r\n\r\n\"I do not trust them at all. They are making\r\n\r\nmoney from our plight. They should give us comfort\r\nand not use our HIV status to enrich themselves.\r\n\r\nWe are the widows, orphans, mothers and the wives\r\n\r\nof the millions of people living with HIV and Aids.\r\nWe know best. I am the one who had to bear the\r\n\r\nbrunt of going public about my status. So why can't\r\nwe be the coordinators? Why can't we be the advis-\r\nadvisers?\r\nWhy can't we get paid?\"\r\nTalking about her friends who have died of Aidsrelated\r\nillnesses, Kamunde says: \"I have shed many\r\ntears but life goes on. I am so positive about being\r\nHIV-positive that I hope I will be the first person in\r\nthe world to take the drug or vaccine that will be\r\ninvented to cure us. I keep telling my friends 'do\r\nnot die, wait for the drug.' But, unfortunately, some\r\nof them do not listen to me!\"\r\nKamunde's hope is to get a permanent job with a\r\nmonthly salary. \"The first thing I will do is leave my\r\nin-laws' servant's quarters for good.\"\r\nMeanwhile, the \"Director of HIV or Director of\r\nVirus\", as Kamunde is endearingly called in Mombasa,\r\nis intent on bringing sunshine and hope to the\r\nlives of hundreds of people living with Aids and\r\ntheir families.\r\nNothing can get her down, it seems. Talking\r\nabout her weight loss, Kamunde laughs: \"OK, I\r\nhave lost 25 kg. I am only 40 years old, and that is\r\nwhen life begins. I am, therefore, very happy to be\r\nslim.\" - An A wefeature"}
