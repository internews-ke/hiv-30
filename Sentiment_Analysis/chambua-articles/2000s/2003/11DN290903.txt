            or many participants at the just-
            concluded 13th International Confer-
            ence on Aids and Sexually Transmitted
            Infections in Africa (ICASA), one of the
            most refreshing things was that people
spoke frankly and unabashedly about sex, sexual
preferences and the connection with HIV/Aids and
STIs.
   A writer in one of the tens of publications that
appeared during the conference described the
atmosphere thus: "Everybody does it and finally

ference on Aids in Afri,ca is anything to go by,-the

be".
   Besides the usual sessions one would expect at
such a conference, with over 6,000 participants,

have Sex with Men and Women who have Sex with
Women).

it was even being discussed openly was a sign of                                                                                                                                                                Photo/Peter Karuri
