         critical.
            The public mood expressed thus far makes it
self-evident that the Bill will be shot down by Parliament if it
is tabled in its present form. That, alone, provides enough
reason for the Government to rethink it.
    Justice Minister Kiraitu Murungi has already stated that
the draft Bill is not cast in stone. He has welcomed public
debate on the. Bill and assured us that the document could be
revised once it comes before Parliament.
  . We could go further than that. Instead of.presenting the
Bill in its present form, the Governmen1 should, itself, take
the initiative, withdraw the published version and introduce
one shorn of the proposals already considered unacceptable.
    It should not be too difficult at this stage to figure out what
is wrong with the Bill. There has been free debate and a
large number of individuals and organisations have talked
about and written in deta~1about. what they find
objectionable ..
    The media have played: an important role in facilitating
this debate by providing space fora wide variety of '"iews.
    As healthy as the debate has been, it has also been evident
that many of the views expressed were based On ignorance'                                                                             BETWEEN US 0 KWAMCHETSI MAKOKHA
