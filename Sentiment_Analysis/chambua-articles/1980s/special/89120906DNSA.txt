{"text": "DAILY NATION\r\nNairobi, Saturday, December 9, 1989\r\nNot quite a cure, but what promise\r\n\r\nLet the entire world keep ita fingers crossed and pray tha\r\nthis will be it. Kenya\ufffds researchers and scientjst8 at th\r\nNairobi-based Kenya Medical Research Institute (Kemri\r\nhave given humankind another ray of hope in its flgh\r\nagainst the fatal disease, the Acquired Immune Deflcienc3\r\nSyndrome (Aids).\r\nThe researchers have developed a promising drug in thE\r\nbattle against the scourge that threatens to decimate th\ufffd\r\nworld\ufffds population. \ufffdWe do not claim to have a cure fo\r\nAids, but we have given Aids sufferers the best chance\r\navailable and. another chance to lead normal lives,\ufffd was the\r\nnvetting message from Kemri\ufffds director, Dr Davy Koech.\r\nEqually captivating were the details: The drug, code.\r\nnamed KE089, has been administered to a number of\r\npeople and the symptoms of the disease were erased in a\r\nmatter of days. Fifteen of the sufferers were invited to the\r\ncelebrations to mark Kemri\ufffds tenth anniversary last\r\nWednesday, a day which, Dr Koech said, they might not\r\nhave lived to see. .\r\nThat is good news indeed, for there is hope that the drug\r\ncoLild be developed into a cure, and our own medics will\r\nhave struck a blow for science, for the whole world against a\r\nkiller that stalks mankind with a chilling and menacing\r\nvengeance. Our ardent hope and prayer is that our hard\r\nworking medics and scientists will strive even further\r\ntowards this goal. That is the ultimate.\r\nWe are, quite naturally, cock-a-hoop about KEOS9, as are\r\nthe unfortunate victims of Aids, in particular, and the\r\n. world, in general, but, like President Moi and Dr Koech\r\nsaid, the drug is not yet a cure, and Kenyans must not relax\r\ntheir morality. It is tempting - very tempting, in fact, for\r\nsome people to let their hair down, and resort to\r\npromiscuity in celebration.\r\nDon\ufffdT Do That. That is the message, that is the counsel,\r\nrom the President. Like the President said, Kenyans must\r\n.emajn decent people, even when a cure for Aida is\r\ndiscovered. Put the way Kenyans know it best, Zero-\r\nGrazing must continue, for that is thebest way to combat\r\nthe disease until such a time as a cure is found.\r\nThe news from Kemri would suggest that a cure may well\r\nbe in sight, and perhaps what Kenyans can do to hasten the\r\nadvent of that day is to support the institute in every\r\npossible way in its endeavours to get a cure. If it be a\r\nquestion 6f funding, we would urge the Government to\r\nsupplement whatever money there is already at the disposa].\r\nof Kemri. The researchers can rest assured that they have\r\nthe moral support of every single Kenyan.\r\nThe reason for this is, of course, obvious. There are an\r\nestimated 250,000 Kenyans who are thought to be afflicted\r\nwith the HIV virus which causes Aids. They are healthy,\r\nnormal and active, sexually that is, but they do not know\r\nthat. they are Aids carriers, because they have yet tddevelop\r\nthe symptoms.\r\nThat scenario is as staggering as it is horrifying. The\r\nprognosis is simply shattering. That is one important\r\nreason why every single Kenyan is very excited about\r\nKE089 and why Kenyans must continue to adhere to the\r\nMinistry of Health\ufffds guidelines on the prevention of the\r\nspread of A\ufffddS.\r\nWhen all is said and done, however, the indication is that\r\nKemri can save the world. Kenya can take the lead in the\r\nfight against Aids, a disease which has been used to malign\r\nus and which has been unfairly claimed to have originated\r\nin Africa.\r\nGood luck, our researchers at Kemri! The whole world is\r\nlooking to you f\ufffdr a cure, and that is no mean task. We are\r\nsolidly behind you, and we hope you will do us proud."}
