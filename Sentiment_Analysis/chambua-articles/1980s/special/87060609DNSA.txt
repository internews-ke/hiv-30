{"text": "NATION June 6 1987\r\nMammoth death talks amidst indifference\r\nBy IRWIN ARIEFF,\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, Friday\r\nIn a vast hotel conference hail in\r\ncentral Washington, thousands\r\nsit in sober silence as scientist\r\nafter scientists talks of what can\r\nand cannot \ufffd be done about a\r\ngrave and terrifying disease.\r\nBut in a nearby exhibit hail\r\nand in the street outside, the atmosphere is almost like carnival. reminding those at the third\r\nInternational conference on Aids\r\nthat life, commerce and politics\r\ncan exist side by side with death.\r\nIn the exhibit area, homosexual rights activists promote tolerance and better care for victims, most of whom have come from their ranks, while medical technology firms sell blood testing equipment and Latex gloves.\r\nIn one corner, a laboratory\r\ntesting machine endlessly inflates\r\na condom to the size of a water\r\nmelon, then deflates it and starts\r\nall over again.\r\nOn the sidewalk next to the hotel, a crowd looks on as a man\r\ndressed in a \ufffdgrim reaper\ufffd costume offers sarcastic thanks to a\r\nman posing as Lis surgeon-general C. Everett Koop.\r\n \ufffdDoes circumcision predispose\r\none to Aids?\ufffd asks a handbill dis\r\ntributed by a smiling representative of the National Organisation\r\nof Circumcision Information Re\r\nsource Centres of San Anselmo, California.\r\nThe week-long conference, the largest held to date on Acquired\r\nImmune Deficiency Syndrome,\r\nhas attracted over 7,000 researchers, public health officials and groups with keen \ufffd sometimes life and death \ufffd interest in the\r\nissue.\r\nNearly 1,000 members of the\r\nPress had signed up for at least\r\nsome part of the conference, officials said. \r\nLarge crowd-control signs posted around the hotel are a\r\nconstant reminder of the mob in attendance.\r\n\ufffdThe conference is over-sub\r\nscribecf,\ufffd the signs read. \ufffdEntrance to sessions is on a first-\r\ncome first-serve basis.\ufffd\r\nBanks of television lights and\r\nhot, humid weather has aggravated the situation by sending temperatures soaring in some of, the\r\nconference rooms and in the hall ways outside.\r\nOne young woman, a health official from Connecticut, solved\r\nthe problem by attending sessions in shorts and a bright red\r\nT-shirt with the slogan, \ufffdcondoms are cheaper than coffins\ufffd.\r\nHer message trumpets the view of researchers who say regular\r\nuse of condoms helps prevent the spread of Aids.\r\nWhile the big names of the Aids research world present their\r\nfindings in the hotel ballroom, which can hold several thousand\r\npeople, lesser lights are relegated to smaller.\r\nAnd with more than 1,000 papers being presented at the conference, many researchers \ufffd\r\nabout 150 each day \ufffd do not even get a speaking forum and must summarise their work in posters\r\n, pinned to bulletin boards.\r\n\ufffdImportant posters must be removed by 4.00 p.m.\ufffd, say signs\r\nplaced between the rows of posters.\r\nStudy titles range from formidably academic to terse: \ufffdEvaluation of human immune deficiency\r\nvirus 1GM and Antigen assays for determination of perinatal infection with HJV,\ufffd read one. \ufffdAids\r\nin Canada. Heterosexual transmission,\ufffd said another. (Reuters)"}
