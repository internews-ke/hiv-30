AGAINST A DREADED KILLER

The manual encourages health
personnel to care for the patients
with love and compassion; know
how to advise the carriers how
not to spread the virus and most
important, they must share with
the community their knowledge
but the disease and the means
of controlling its spread.
The manual has 26 pages
which explain in crisp and simple
language the major issues relating
to the dreaded disease. The first
heading strives to explain what
is and gives a brief history of
 the disease. In the four headings
that follow, information on what
the HIV virus is, who is a carrier
how the virus is spread and is
spread is given.
The heeding on how the virus
read gives the properties of
Kenya virus as “not very active” and
therefore that the concern
ration of the virus must be very
to cause infection. Among
modes of spread are homosexual and heterosexual contact, contaminated needles and syringes, transfusion of contaminated blood and the bearing of children by infected mothers. Sexual contact and
having of toilet seats and cups not considered important: Information headed on how to conduct themselves, but also their relatives and
hospitals. Only seriously afflicted
patients should be taken to
Hospitals are straightforward and simple.
The emphasis of the manual is responsible living.
In the final analysis, the man
should serve not only the
health workers but relatives and
friends of HIV patients and the
general public.
