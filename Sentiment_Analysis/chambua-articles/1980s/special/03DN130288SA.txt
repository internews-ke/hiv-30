By NATION Reporter
The Minister for Health, Mr. Kenneth Matiba, yesterday launched a Sh50 million national
Health campaign to control the
Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome (AIDS) disease.
The Minister who was accompanied by the Director of Medical
Services, Professor Thomas
Ogada, told a press conference at
the Ministry’s headquarters that
“every person in Kenya must receive information on the prevention and control of Aids.”
Public education is the only
weapon to fight Ads since there
is no vaccine or drug to control
the human immune deficiency virus (HIV), he said.
. “We have to tell our people that there is no room for casual sex or promiscuity,” Mr. Matiba said.
“We intend to use all the available channels of communication
to inform people. This means the
Press, chiefs, Kanu officials, nongovernmental organisations,
schools, radio, television, posters
and music,” the Minister said.
He played a taped music by a
Kenyan Band Them Mush
rooms” warning people Lo stick to
their partners because Aids is in
curable and fatal. The song is in
English and Kiswahili and the
Ministry hopes that upto 2,000
Cassettes tapes with the music
will be freely given to various
groups including matatus.
The Minister said that four
strategies would be adapted in
the campaign against Aids which
haa affected 1,304 people since
the first case was confirmed in
Kakamega.
The first is to determine how
the deadly disease is spreading in
the country. The second element
is public health education followed by clinical aspect dealing with those already infected.
