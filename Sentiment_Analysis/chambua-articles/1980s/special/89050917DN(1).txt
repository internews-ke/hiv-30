{"text": "DAILY NATION TUESDAY SEPTEMBER 5, 1989\r\nCONDOMS NO SUBSTITUTE TO FIDELITY\r\n\r\nAt last week\ufffds seminar for journalists on Aids, Professor\r\nJoseph Oliech, the Director of Medical Services, warned that Aids threatened our survival and that of future generations. Are condoms the answer against this threat?\r\n\r\nDorothy Munyakho participated at the seminar and gives her view.\r\nAt last week\ufffds two-day seminar for journalists on Aids, this message recurred constantly chastity outside marriage and fidelity within it are the best safeguards but where this is apply, condoms to minimise the infection.\r\nIn fact condoms have become so integral to the global Aids campaign that one may be\r\nForgiven to suppose that the two approaches \ufffd chastity and fidelity on one hand, and condoms on the other, are interchangeable options.\r\nThe liberal provision of condoms at the seminar display table and the speed with which they disappeared testifies to the\r\nimportance that has come to be\r\nattached to condoms as a shield\r\nagainst the spread of Ada.\r\nI was one of the panelists invited to address the topic: \ufffdHow\r\njournalists can help to change attitudes and sexual behaviour.\ufffd\r\nPromiscuous sex has all along\r\nbeen associated with the spread\r\nof Aids, and one would have expected the media to preoccupy it\r\nself with how best to transmit\r\nmessages that emphaise the opposite of promiscuity. Not quite.\r\nThe message was, clearly, abstinence and marital fidelity for\r\nthose who can practise the twin\r\nvirtues, and condoms for those\r\nwho cannot.\r\nA brief overview of how the\r\nabove message was put across\r\nwill suffice.\r\nEven after a highly positive\r\nmessage which decried the glorification of sex, use of sex appeal\r\nin advertising, sexy music and\r\nlove songs, the director of Medical Services, Professor Joseph\r\nOliech, still found it necessary to\r\ndigress and say: \ufffdWe need the\r\ndisc jockey at the nht club to\r\ntalk about condoms.\r\nProf Oliech had pinpointed the\r\nsocial approval of having many\r\ngirls and boyfriends and extra\r\nmarital affairs as being conducive\r\nto the spread of Aids.\r\n\ufffdBecause of Aids, we are telling\r\npeople now that all that is wrong\r\nand risky: that this has to change\r\n\ufffd for their survival and the survival of future generations.\ufffd the\r\nOMS had said Still, he found a\r\nplace for condoms, if only in one\r\nsentence, thereby diluting the\r\nvery powerful message he had put\r\nacross.\r\nThe deputy programme man\r\nager of the Nations Aids Control\r\nProgrammes (NACP), Mrs Margaret Gatei asked: \ufffdIs abstaining\r\npractical? If not, why talk about it?\ufffd\r\nI found Dr Dundu Owili\ufffds position ambivalent. While acknowledging that condom promotion\r\nand use in rural areas poses disposal problems; while acknowledging that some Kenyan men\r\ncannot use condoms because of\r\ntheir communities\ufffd style of circumcision; and while further acknowledging that some condoms\r\nwere inappropriate for Kenyan\r\nmen by virtue of their size, Dr. Owili, who has chaired the clinics sub-committee of the NACP,\r\nstill thought that condoms should\r\ncontinue to be promoted for Aids\r\ncontrol, provided that their promotion is accompanied by education on their proper use.\r\nThe chairman of NACP\ufffdS Information, Education and Communication sub-committee. Dr. Sobbje Mulindi, underlined NACP\ufffds stand on condoms say\r\ning: \ufffdIn the absence cf anything\r\nelse, what can we do\ufffd\ufffd\r\nIt is important to note that Dr. Mulindi and his colleagues all\r\nagreed that condoms are not fool\r\nproof as shield against Aids, and\r\nthey are only offered as an option\r\nfor those who cannot abstain\r\nfrom sex or be faithful to their\r\nmarital partners.\r\nI could go a step further and\r\nrule condoms out altogether because not only do they reinforce\r\nsexual attitudes conducive to the\r\nspread of Aids and other sexually\r\ntransmitted diseases, but they\r\nalso offer a false sense of security.\r\nOn average, 10 out of every 100\r\nwomen using condoms as a contraceptive device become pregnant, and there is no reason why\r\nthe condoms safety record should\r\nbe better in Aids prevention. The Aids virus is infinitely smaller\r\nthan the male sperm, and chances are that the failure rate\r\nof condoms in Aids prevention\r\nwill be even higher than in\r\ncontraception.\r\nThis failure rate is compound\r\ned by the fact that while women\r\ncan only get pregnant on five\r\ndays within a menstrual cycle,\r\nthe risk of Aids, especially among\r\nthe high risk groups - notably\r\nthe prostitutes, is daily. And\r\nwhile it is only a woman who is\r\ncapable of pregnancy in case a\r\ncondom fails to prevent contraception, both men and women\r\nrisk Aide in promiscuous sexual\r\nencounters.\r\nOne of the questions I would\r\nhave loved answered at that seminar is just why it is considered\r\nimpossible for people to abstain\r\nfrom sex outside marriage. Is it\r\nreally true that there are people\r\nwho will not change their sexual\r\nbehaviour even when it is a life\r\nand death matter?\r\nIf it be true, what are the circumstances that make people impervious to change? Can they be\r\naltered?\r\nAt a recent workshop on Aids,\r\npert of the family life promotion\r\ncongress, Dr Cecilia Pypsr of Oxford, England, addressed this\r\nsame issue. Why are people not\r\nchanging their habits in spite of\r\nknowing all about Aids?\r\nThe answer lies in the manner\r\nin which the message has been\r\nput across to them, and Dr Pyper gave the example of two frogs.\r\nOne is put in cold water, which is\r\nthen heated gradually to boiling\r\npoint. The other is thrown in hot\r\nwater. According to Dr Pyper,\r\nthe first frog will die in the boil\ufffdng water, while the second frog\r\nwill jump out immediately, there\r\nby saving itself.\r\nThe moral of this is that the\r\nfull implications of irresponsible\r\nsexual behaviour need to be put\r\nacross without creating the falie\r\nhope that condoms will save us\r\nfrom ultimate disaster.\r\nThis1 point cannot be over\r\nemphasised especially as regards\r\nwomen. While it is quite possible\r\nfor a man to get away with Aids\r\neven in an \ufffdunprotected\ufffd sexual\r\nencounter because he dips in and\r\nout and washes or wipes his or\r\ngan, thereby minimising the risk\r\nof exposure to the killer virus, it\r\nis not so easy for women.\r\nOur sexual organs, unfortunately, act as a reservoir, and retain sperms and other germs that\r\nmay leak through the condom.\r\nScientists think that infection\r\nfrom Aids is largely a result of\r\nConcentration of infected sperm\r\neither in the female genitalia or\r\nin the rectum in case of homosexual encounters. It is also true that\r\nall sexual encounter is accompanied with some degree of trauma,\r\nwhich makes it easy for the HIV virus, in this context, to get into the blood stream.\r\nClearly, the best strategy for crushing Aids would seem to be\r\npreventing all risky sexual."}
