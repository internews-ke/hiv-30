{"text": "November 25, 1989\r\nWORLD FOCUS TURNS TO THE ANTI-AIDS CAMPAIGN\r\n\r\nBy OTULA OWUOR, Science Editor\r\n\r\nTomorrow, Kenya joins the rest\r\nof humanity in marking World\r\nAids Day.\r\nAids, a disease which emerged\r\nunder a cloud of much controversy and mystery eight years ago,\r\nas now taken a firm hold in\r\ncountries. The Acquired\r\nmune Deficiency Syndrome\r\n(Aids) caused by the human\r\nimmuno-deficiency virus (HIV)\r\nalready threatens the lives of up\r\nto 6 million people in the world.\r\nIn Kenya, where the first Aids\r\ncase was noted in 1984, up to\r\n6,000 people have developed the\r\ndisease while many others may be\r\ncarriers. Aids can no longer be confronted. i.e. has no cure\r\nand prevention remains the only\r\nsalvation. The \ufffdvirus can .infect\r\nanybody and the Ministry of\r\nHealth, through the National\r\nAids Committee (NAC) is trying\r\nagainst heavy odds to control or\r\ncurb increased HIV infections.\r\nThis year, the second World\r\n, Aids Day focuses on the youth.\r\nwho are among the most vulnerable groups. The themes are: \ufffdOur\r\nlives, our world \ufffd lets take care of\r\neach other\ufffd and \ufffd Operation\r\ncrush Aids; and the youth face\r\n. the flghL\ufffd The Ministry, has\r\nplanned a number of activities to\r\nhelp make people more aware of\r\nhow to prevent the spread of the.\r\ndeadly infection. .\r\nThere will be public lectures\ufffd\r\nand the seriousness the Ministry\r\nattaches to kids will be reflected\r\nby the fact that. Ministers and\r\nMembers of the Parliament are\r\namong the individuals scheduled\r\nto deliver lectures.\r\nThe Minister for Health, Mr. Mwai Kibaki, will feature\r\nProminently in the activities of\r\nthe day accompanied by the\r\nchairman of NAC, Dr J.R. Were,\r\nwho heads the clinical research\r\nsection of the Kenya research\r\ninstitute.  The fighting AIDS campaign will\r\nrun from November 26 to December 3 and apart from public lectures, it will involve visits to\r\nschools, colleges, markets, factories, clubs and talks to girl\r\n\ufffd guides, boy scouts, KANU youth\r\nwingers and Catholic youth associations. The churches, mosques\r\nand temples should include special prayers for Aids patients and\r\nall the institutions or groups may\r\nget audio visuals on Aids from\r\nthe Aids control programme.\r\nIn. Africa heterosexual activities remain the major cause of\r\nHIV. Socio-economj\ufffd and cultural factors make it difficult for the\r\nKenyan youth and those in other\r\nparts-of the world to learn about\r\nthe dangers link\ufffdd to sex outside\r\nmarnge or sex with many part\r\nners. I he youth, who are under\r\ngoing major biological and physical changes driving them towards,\r\nactive sex. need to be told about\r\nthis new deadly infection.\r\nIndeed, according to medical researchers, efforts have been\r\ndoubled to find methods of treat\r\ning Aids patients who lose their\r\nnatural ability in fight against\r\ninfection because the Aids virus\r\ndamages the cells involved in protecting the body. A cure may not\r\nbe found during this century be\r\ncause of several factors. Chief\r\namong this is the fact that the\r\nvirus changes or mutates rapidly\r\n\ufffdt actually enters our cells and\r\ncan lie dormant by inserting its\r\nmaterial into that of the\r\ncells.\r\nThis year\ufffds anti-Aids campaign\r\nwill be held in all the eight provincial headquarters \ufffd Nyeri,\r\nMombasa, Embu, Kakamega\r\nNakuru, Garissa, Nairobi and\r\nKisumu.\r\nThe emphasis on communication, information and education\r\non all aspects of the disease is an\r\nindicator that everybody should\r\naim at preventing the spread of\r\nHIV infection. Already the head\r\nof the education, information and\r\ncommunication subcommittee of\r\nthe NAC, Dr. Sobbie Mulindi, has\r\nlaunched an aggressive campaign\r\naimed at all educational institutions. At the University of\r\nNairobi, the Association of Medical Studies is already involved\r\nin the campaign, The Director of Medical Services, Professor J. Oliech, has repeatedly held frank\r\nDiscusions with the local Press\r\nand urged them to-help in the war\r\nagainst the spread of the virus.\r\nThe government has ensured\r\nthat all blood for transfusion is\r\nscreened for the presence of Aids.\r\n\ufffdThis means that patients in need\r\nof blood should be generally safe.\r\nHowever, the negligible probability that donated blood could be\r\ninfectious because of false positive or negative test results has\r\nbeen further minimised by the\r\nfact that nowadays Kenyan doctors\r\nresort to blood transfusions\r\nonly in extreme cases where the\r\nlives of patients are threatened.\r\nThe Aids virus is also infecting\r\nsome of the children born to\r\nmothers infected with the virus.\r\nAt first it was assumed that all\r\nthe children born to such mothers could be infected but it is now\r\nknown that some of them just\r\ncarry the antibodies transfered\r\nfrom the mother but not the actual virus. Thus a number of children who test positive sometimes\r\nbegin testing negative after a while.\r\nStill the children should be\r\nbreastfed and be given all the required immunisation, in addition, the doctor\ufffds opinion should\r\nbe sought in case of only the tuberculosis vaccine.\r\nKenya recently asked for up to Sh216 million to help in its anti-Aids campaign. The Ministry\r\nshould be able to receive all the money because the country has taken the disease seriously and is\r\neven attempting to integrate it into its primary health care programmes. Kenyan health workers have quickly been trained to cope with various aspects of the infection. This includes clinical management and counselling."}
