Eight factors blamed for children’s deaths

A senior lecturer at the University of Nairobi Dr. Dorothy Kinuthia yesterday identified eight causes of early child deaths in Kenya.
Dr. Kinuthia of the College of
Health Sciences told a Kenya
Medical Women Association Scientific Conference at the Kenyatta International Conference Centre (KICC) Nairobi that if the eight causes were redressed, child mortality would be cut drastically. These causes are lack of better health education especially for mothers, better nutrition and food supply system, better quality water supply and sanitation around the home, adequate maternal child health and family education and better immunization and the programs that control diseases and supply of essential drugs near homes and attention to health facilities. She said that respiratory problems and diarrheal diseases caused up to 40 per cent of child mortality in Kenya.
