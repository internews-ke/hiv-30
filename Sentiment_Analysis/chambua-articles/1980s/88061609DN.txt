{"text": "THURSDAY JUNE 16 1988\r\nAIDS EFFECTS WORRY WORLD BANK\r\nBy ALVER CARLSON\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, Wednesday\r\nspread of Aids in many\r\nThird World countries could\r\nthreaten the development of their\r\neconomies, World Bank officials\r\nsay.\r\nOfficials at the bank \ufffd which\r\nlends money to countries to help\r\nmeet their basic development\r\nneeds \ufffd are concerned that the\r\nvirus is hitting the most productive group of people in the poorest countries, making economic\r\nadvancement more difficult.\r\n\ufffdAt present, those dying of\r\nAids in the developing world are\r\nlargely women in their 20s and\r\nmen their 30s and 40s \ufffd age\r\ngroups normally associated with\r\nhigh productivity and primary\r\nfamily responsibility.\ufffd the bank\r\nsaid in a recent publication.\r\n\ufffdIf large numbers of productive\r\nmembers of society die of Aids,\r\nand similarly Large numbers of\r\nthe next generation are victims of\r\nAids, the consequences of\r\nnational economies and societies\r\nas a whole can only be highly negative,\ufffd the publication added.\r\nThe World Health\r\nOrganisation (WHO) says 139\r\ncountries have reported at least\r\none case of Aids, with the total\r\nnow standing at more than\r\n91,000, including 4,627 new cases\r\nthis year.\r\nWHO said the Aids crisis was\r\nfar worse than the reported figures showed.\r\nIt estimated that probably\r\nsome 500,000 people worldwide\r\nhad Aids symptoms and some\r\nfive to 10 million were carrying\r\nthe HIV virus that causes the\r\ndeadly acquired Immune deficiency Syndrome.\r\nThe World Bank is concerned\r\nabout how best to allocate limited\r\nresources to prevent the spread\r\nof Aida.\r\n\ufffdI think the World Bank has a\r\nmandate to improve the health of\r\nthese countries and. to facilitate\r\ntheir development and we have to\r\nbe particularly careful that we\r\ndon t do more harm if we take\r\nresources away from programmes\r\nthat are saving many lives and\r\nput them into a HIV prevention\r\nprogramme,\ufffd said the banks\r\nexpert, Mead Over.\r\nAids is spread through sexual\r\ncontact, the use of contaminated\r\nneedles and through the blood\r\nsupply.\r\nMany Aids experts, including\r\nthose at the World Bank, believe\r\nevery person infected in the past\r\nhas spread the disease to from\r\none to 11 others.\r\nAt least half and perhaps all\r\nthose infected will eventually fall\r\nvictim to the virus, experts\r\nestimate.\r\nFor the desperately poor of\r\nAfrica, Aids is inly one of the\r\nmany health problems they must\r\nface.\r\nMany parts of the continent\r\nare overwhelmed by malaria,\r\nmeasles, pneumonia, sick -cell disease, tuberculosis and premature\r\nbirths. .\r\nBut Aida differs in three basic\r\nways. It strikes rich and poor\r\nalike, is growing at epidemic proportions and has no cure in sight.\r\nIn its efforts to deal with the impact of Aids, the bank has had\r\nto look beyond setting up hospitals and other health care\r\nfacilities.\r\nUganda has been hit by the\r\nAids epidemic at a time when its\r\nhealth care system is virtually\r\nnon-existent and it is impossible to set up a blood screening operation to ensure blood used for\r\ntransfusions is free of the virus.\r\nWorld Bank officials say it is difficult to inform people about Aids when no health education\r\nprogrammes exist.\r\nIn such a situation, the bank\ufffds\r\nrole is to help a country build ita\r\nhealth system so that WHO can\r\ncome in and set up education\r\nprojects and other health care\r\nfacilities.\r\nMr Over said the bank was discussing a loan with Uganda to help build its health system.\r\nA project is under way in Burundi to analyse the implications\r\nof Aids, while two others, in Zaire\r\nand Brazil, are in an advanced\r\nataje of preparation. A Haiti\r\nAids project is under study.\r\nThe developing world has been\r\nexperiencing a debt crisis since\r\n1982 that has been primarily concentrated in Latin America and\r\nAfrica.\r\n\ufffdWomen have been particular\r\nly vulnerable to job loss over the\r\npast few years, and many have\r\nturned to occasional prostitution\r\nto supplement family incomes,\ufffd\r\nthe bank publication said.\r\n(Reuters)"}
