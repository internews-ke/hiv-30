{"text": "Nation Thursday June 4 1987\r\nExperts brainstorm\r\nBy DANIEL O. HANEY,\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, Wednesday\r\nAs many as 10 million people\r\nWorldwide already are infected\r\nwith the AIDS virus, and Aids\r\ndeaths could cause political and\r\neconomic upheaval In severely\r\naffected countries, an International health official said\r\nTuesday.\r\n\ufffd\ufffdThe epidemic has just started,\ufffd cautioned Dr Jonathan\r\nMann of the World Health Organisation.\r\nAs of Monday, 51,536 Aids cases had been reported in 113\r\ncountries, he acid. But he\r\nestimated that between 10 and 20 times that number may be infected with the virus.\r\nMike every other major health problem, Aids strikes sexually active adults in their\r\nprime working years.\r\nThe selective involvement of young and middle-aged adults including business and government people and members of other social, economic and political elites, leads to a potential for economic and political destabilisation in areas of the developing world severely affected by HIV,\ufffd the Aids virus,\r\nMann said. \ufffdWhat political system could withstand foe long the destabilization influence of a 200r28 per cent\r\nor higher HIV infection rate-among young adults?\ufffd he asked.\r\nMann, who is head head of the World health organisation\ufffd. \r\nprogramme, spoke at the third international conference.\r\nOnce people catch the Aids\r\nvirus, they are believed to be infected for life. Just how many of\r\nthem actually will get the\r\nAcquired Immune Deficiency\r\nSyndrome is unclear, although\r\nmore than a third of the infected\r\npeople in one San Francisco\r\nstudy have contracted the lethal\r\ndisease, which attacks the body\ufffds\r\nability to resist other infection.\r\nand diseases.\r\nExperts can also only roughly\r\nguess how many outwardly\r\nhealthy people are infected and\r\ncapable of passing on the virus\r\nduring the, childbirth or sharing Hypodermic needles.\r\nin the United State, Dr James Cunan, head of the Aids\r\nProgramming at the Centre Disease Control, said\ufffd the belt\r\nis that 1.6 million people\r\nare infected. \ufffdIbis would mean\r\nthat perhaps, one in 30 men\r\nbetween the ages of 20 and 50\r\ncarry the virus, likely to be the second leading cause of\r\nPremature death, after accidents, among American men.\r\nIn Central Africa, where the epidemic is believed to have\r\nstarted, Dr. Okware said one\r\nstudy suggests that perhaps. nearly 2 per cent of the population is becoming infected annually. \ufffdAt the rate the disease is spreading, it is only a matter of Lime befor, the countries, that don\ufffdt report any caeses. feel the full uncompromising ferocity of this disease,\ufffd said Okware, head of the national Aids committee in Uganda. in other developments at the conference: cleaning out used hypodermic needles with bleach, dish detergent, rubbing alcohol, vodka or win, can kill the Aids virus, thus reducing the high risk of infection of drug addicts from dirty needles, said a report by Dr. Sunita Jam of the university California, Davis. The report\r\nfound that beer and cola were ineffective In killing the virus. (AP)"}
