{"text": "12TH March 1987\r\nAIDS: KOINANGE URGES FRANKNESS\r\n\r\nBy OTULA OWUOR\r\nNations should discard the\r\n\ufffdholier than thou\ufffd attitude in\r\ndealing with the Acquired\r\nImmune Deficiency\r\nSyndrome (Aids), the Director of Medical Services,\r\nKaruga Koinange told an\r\ninternational press conference\r\nin Nairobi yesterday.\r\nAccompanied by Lop official\r\nfrom the World Health Organization (WHO). Mr. Koinange said:\r\n\ufffdAids is a worldwide problem\r\nand hardly any country can\r\nclaim not ti) have the disease.\ufffd\r\nBy the end of January, Kenya\r\nhad a cumulative number of\r\ncases with 313 deaths. The\r\ncases had been diagnosed in all\r\nthe provinces although the high-\r\nnak groups contributed most or\r\nthe cases, he said.\r\nDr Koinange that all blood\r\nfor transfusion in Mombasa and\r\nNairobi was being tested for aids\r\nand only 0.7 per cent or\r\nseven of a thousand tests were\r\npositive in the two cities.\r\n\ufffd11 is important to let everyone\r\nknow what they should do to\r\navoid Aids because the risks are\r\nthe same at home or when travelling internationally.\ufffd he said.\r\nHe told the international\r\nmedia that Kenya would extend\r\nits blood screening process to all\r\nprovincial hospitals by the end of\r\nMarch and then proceed to the\r\ndistrict hospitals.\r\nThe head of WHO Aids\r\nprogramme, Jonathan Mann,\r\nsaid the assumption that Aids\r\nwas more prevalent in other countries or communities may give a\r\nfalse sense of security to some\r\nnations or communities.\r\nThe international press conference was being held after India\r\nthreatened to expel foreign\r\nstudents resisting compulsory\r\nAids test.  Mann said WHO\r\nexperts had decided that screen\r\nInternational travelers may\r\nthe disease.\r\nHe said the rate of Aids in\r\nKenya \ufffdis lower or and at most\r\nequal to that in the European\r\ncountries but it is definitely lower\r\nthan that in the United States\ufffd.\r\nD Mann told the 56 journalists\r\nit was unfortunate that people\r\nstill associated Aids with certain\r\nparts al the world, especially\r\nAfrica and the United States.\r\nl-le said that although only a\r\nquarter million dollars had been\r\nallocated for the Aids\r\ntested cases was about 48,000 spread\r\nover 91 countries.\r\n\ufffdAids is a serious disease\r\nposing a potential threat to all\r\nand since it is worldwide the risk\r\nis the same at home or over-\r\nsenses,\ufffd he said. \ufffdAggressive\r\npublic education on risks and\r\nprevention is needed.\ufffd ,\r\nDr Mann agreed with Dr\r\nKoinange that no nation or\r\nresearchers could claim to know\r\nthe percentage of Aids carriers in\r\na community or country because\r\nwhole populations had\r\nnot been subjected to the tests\r\n\ufffdwhich in any case may seem\r\nnegative but become positive\r\nsoon after\ufffd.\r\nDuring a question and answer\r\nsession the doctors told journalists that some of the early Aids-research and tests done in\r\nAfrica had proved false and\r\nsome of the researchers had\r\neven retracted.\r\nHowever, Dr Mann defended\r\nhis research findings that the\r\nHuman immunodeficiency Virus\r\n(HIV) or the Aids virus may have\r\nbeer present un the continent for\r\na long time \ufffdbecause some of the\r\nblood collected and stored in the\r\nearly 1960s tested positive\ufffd.\r\nBut he added \ufffdI don\ufffdt know\r\nwhether results taken irom blood\r\nstored far so long are valid.\ufffd\r\n\ufffdThe latest Wilt) Aids data\r\ndated March 1987 was released\r\nto the international media, and\r\nit indicated that the US with\r\n30,838 cases was still leading\r\nin the incidence of the killer disease, Brazil has 1,012 cases.\r\nFrance leads in Europe with\r\n1,221 cases, followed by West\r\nGermany with 875 cases. \r\nGanada\r\nhas 873.\r\nIn Africa, \ufffdTanzania has reported 699 cases.\r\nThe American continent leads\r\nwith 34,402 cases, followed by\r\nEurope with 4,559 and then Africa with 2,827 cases.\r\nMr. Koinange said he was not aware that Mombasa was advertised as a sex spot in some Euro\r\nCut1 nations, especially West\r\nGermany.\r\n\ufffdI am not aware that there is\r\nsomething like sex tourism. We\r\nexpect foreigners to enjoy seeing\r\nour wildlife and beautiful\r\nbeaches.\ufffd he said."}
