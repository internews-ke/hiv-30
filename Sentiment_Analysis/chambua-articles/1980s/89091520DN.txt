{"text": "FRIDAY SEPTEMBER 15, 1989\r\n\r\nA NURSE'S AGONY OF LIVING WITH AIDS\r\n\r\nRose Amito, a 29-year old Ugandan nurse has Aids. Last year after learning she was in the first stages of the disease, she joined the staff of the Aids Support Organisation (TASO) a fledging self-help group based-in the capital city. Kampala.\r\nFor 10 years beginning  1977. Ms. Amito worked as a registered nurse, first at a hospital in\r\nEastern Uganda, then, for the Institute of Public Administration L Kampala.\r\nIn 1987 she decided to leave nursing job to pursue a career as a midwife. She enrolled in a\r\ntraining programme at the Alago Nurses Training School,\r\nin March 1988, she fell very\r\n\ufffdI had fever had joint pains,\r\nspecialy in my knees,\ufffd she reassures. \ufffdI wasn\ufffdt able to move easiy so I walked with a stick supiorting me. And I had a coughi4lcb was not responding to treatment\ufffd .\r\nShe was admitted to hospital  MD suspected of having Aids,\r\nwas given blood tests for HIV.\r\n\ufffdI spent two weeks in hospital\r\nand during that time I was really\r\nill and feeling so bad. There Was\r\nno counselling available. It was\r\nterrible,\ufffd\r\nShe was discharged without\r\nknowing the results of her tests\r\nbecause they had not yet come\r\nbeck from the laboratory.\r\nBack at the nurses\ufffd training-\r\nschool, she was shunned by other\r\ntrainees because of her Aids-related body rash.\r\nIn the dormitory she shared\r\nwith 20 other women, beds had\r\nbeen moved a \ufffdsafe\ufffd distance\r\naway. Friends she used to take\r\ntea with avoided her.\r\nShe felt too weak to do her\r\nmidwjfer work and, besides, patients didn\ufffdt appreciate it. when\r\nshe held their hands. She\r\ndropped out of school and went\r\nto live with her youngest sister,\r\nwho was more understanding of\r\nthe problem.\r\n\ufffdI was referred to TASO where\r\nI found colleagues \ufffd friends who\r\nhad the saine problem.\ufffd\r\n.,\r\nDuring a visit to a local Aids\r\nclinic, her fears about her blood\r\ntest were confirmed when she\r\nsaw a simple inscription on her\r\ncase sheet \ufffd HIV positive.\r\n\ufffdAt TASO, they comforted me\r\nand assured me I wouldn\ufffdt die immediately. I told them I wanted\r\nto go back home even though I\r\nknew very well that if I did so\r\nnobody else would bother about\r\nme and I would die there.\ufffd\r\n\ufffdSo they discouraged me from\r\nleaving and told me their person\r\nal stories. They asked me to keep\r\nreporting back for the next few\r\nweeks,\ufffd\r\n\ufffdEach time J caine to TASO I\r\nfelt more at home. Because I was\r\na nurse, they asked me if I could\r\nstay with them and care for some\r\nof the pepple who had been referred to TASO who really need\r\ned help.\ufffd\r\n\ufffdSome had open sores, others\r\nsuffered headaches and such\r\n.things. I accepted their request\r\nand stayed on. So I have been\r\ndipensing the few drugs that the\r\nAUP (Aids Control Programme)\r\nhas assisted us with.\ufffd\r\n\ufffdAt times I take sick friends\r\nhome to stay with me in the small\r\nroom I share with muy sister because TASO doesn\ufffdt have any\r\npLace where we can admit them.\r\nOne woman has some sores\r\nthat need dressing but she can\ufffdt\r\ndo it herself because she is too\r\nweak, Here is somebody you\r\nknow is very ill and maybe there\r\nis no treatment. &t she needs\r\nsomeone by her side to at least\r\ncomfort her and to do small\r\nthings like giving her a sponge\r\nbath.\r\n\ufffdIf these patients are taken to\r\nhospital, nobody is willing to\r\ntouch them, Once somebody sees\r\nyou\ufffdve got a rash like mine, they\r\nkeep away from you and leave\r\nyou lying there.\ufffd\r\n\ufffdThe hospital staff aren\ufffdt well\r\ninformed iout Aids. But since\r\nTASO started holding workshops\r\nfor them, there has been some\r\nsijgit attitude change.\ufffd\r\nThis article is reprinted from\r\nIDRC reports Vo 18, No 2, April 1989."}
