{"text": "NATION THURSDAY DECEMBER 1, 1988\r\nTHE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS KILLER\r\n\r\nAcquired Immune Deficiency\r\nSyndrome (Aids) has the proven to kill millions of people in a\r\nfew years time. It also has the\r\npotential to wreak havoc on the\r\nsocial, economic and political orders of whole nation and the\r\nthe whole world.\r\nThe fact that no cure for the\r\ndisease is available means that\r\ndeath is the only conclusion for\r\nany person infected with Aids.\r\nHowever, the disease\r\nremains incurable and  is one of the\r\nfew epidemics that we all have\r\nthe power to curb. Aids can be\r\nprevented and its spread brought\r\nunder control. Indeed there are\r\nmany bacterial disease\r\nthat may be transmitted by \r\ncontact but this not the\r\ncase with the Aids virus.\r\nFirst a major aspect of preventive to avoid\r\n\ufffdhigh risk\ufffd sexual behavior.\r\nThis in all cases boils down to\r\npeople sticking to one sex partner. The high risk groups has included homosexuals, prostitutes,\r\nand intravenous drug users. Still in Africa where homosexuality\r\nseems minimal, the disease has\r\nsettled on heterosexual mode of transmission.\r\nBecause it is the only tangible option to avert a disaster which\r\nmight even result in a significant\r\ndecline of population in some\r\nareas, these continues unchecked for even a decade.\r\neven if a vaccine against Aids\r\nis found today, the number of\r\nthose infected with HIV will continue to swell because millions\r\nhave already been infected.\r\nCurbing the spread of Aids\r\nthrough health education aimed\r\nat prevention of its spread is the\r\nonly effective alternative, which\r\ndepends on ail of us it is in our\r\nindividual and collective power to\r\ndo this and save lives.\r\nThus prevention of Aids\r\ninvolve&\r\nAvoiding multiple sex partners and sticking to only one\r\npartner. In Kenya and other areas where polygamy is common\r\nthe rule remains the same one has to stick to the married partner because the  spread\r\nof under such Circumstances\r\nwill involve many individuals.\r\nIt must be emphasized that in\r\nAfrica Aids virus is mainly transmitted heterosexually. People should not assume that sticking\r\nto one sex partner is only meant\r\nfor homosexuals.\r\n\ufffdPrevention of high risk behavior like the sharing of nee\r\ndies and syringes by intravenous\r\ndrug users. Although Kenya is\r\nnot known for intravenous drug\r\nuse, a recent case of drug trafficking indicates that there are evil\r\nEfforts to make Kenya another\r\n.major center for illegal drug deal lags. It must not be assumed that\r\nIntravenous drug use is only continued to the West. Our health\r\neducation on Aids should not flared such activities because of\r\ngeneralizations. Kenya has already made\r\nsufficient arrangements to ensure\r\nthat all the blood that is donated\r\nfor transfusion gets screened for\r\nHTV. However, it must be emphasized that medical person and even the recipient or\r\nthose receiving blood ensure the\r\nblood is tested for Ads. Relatives\r\nof patients must also have the\r\ncourage to enquire about this.\r\nto the body to deliver medicines or collect blood and other\r\nFluids must be sterile. In Kenya\r\npeople have to avoid seeking\r\nmedical attention from practitioners because\r\npeople may be working under unsanitary conditions and lack the\r\nFacilities and knowledge about\r\nsterilization.\r\nThus immunisation programmes must resort to disposable syringes that are used only\r\nonce and discarded or ensure effective sterilization facilities.\r\nSex with high risk groups like\r\nprostitute must be avoided.\r\nHowever, it must be said that\r\nthis label can mislead because\r\nthere are many men and women\r\nwho continue to have sex with\r\nmany partners without asking for\r\nmoney and are therefore at high\r\nrisk. Still there are cases of\r\npeople who feel that having sex\r\nwith \ufffdothers\ufffd once in a while is\r\nsafe, but this can still lead to infection with HIV.\r\nAll skin piercing devices must\r\nbe sterilised and in Kenya ail\r\ntypes of cultural activities like\r\ncircumc1ion, ear piercing, making scars or marks on the face, abdomen, the back or any part of\r\nthe body must involve\r\nsterilization or be curbed.\r\nCircumcision can be easily performed in hospitals or by a doctor. Traditional doctors making scars or cute on the\r\nbody must be educated about\r\nAids and such activities must be\r\ncurbed. There may be no\r\ndocumented cases of Aida being\r\ntransmitted this way but it must\r\nbe said that any activities that\r\ninvolve cuts and contact with\r\nblood have the potential of transmitting HIV. This also extends to\r\nthe barbers razor, dentists\ufffd devices and others.\r\n\ufffdProviding information about\r\nAids to all people is a major step\r\nin prevention of the spread of the\r\ndisease. In Kenya this must in-\r\nelude various groups students,\r\nchurches, administrators, teachers party leaders, Members of\r\nParliament, women groups, cooperatives and others. \r\nBasically, Aids is transmitted\r\nvia sex, bloodand mother to child.\r\nIt is important that people\r\nwith Aids or suspecting that they\r\nhave contracted the disease be\r\ngiven a chance to help curb the\r\nspread of the disease. This means\r\nthat they should not be discriminated against and counselling\r\nservices should be easily available for those who undergo confidential Aids teat. Health education on the One of the reasons why As infection is so dreaded by both medical authorities and\r\nlaymen in general is that It\r\nremains incurable to date.\r\nResearches done so far have\r\nnot; yielded positively in find-\r\ning a cure although they has\r\nbrought to light more information about how the infection operates in the human\r\nbody.\r\nThis means that every individual has to developed and adapt the\r\nrecommended preventative practices on a personal level while\r\nmedical authorities and governments ensure the use of only\r\nscreened blood for transmission and sterilized needles and syringes for injections in our medical facilities.\r\nIn February 1985 a drug now known as retroviral or zidovudine\r\nwas said to be active against HIV\r\n(Human Immunodeficiency Virus\r\ncausing Aids). The drug is said to\r\nreduce the rate of replication by\r\nits interference with the enzyme\r\nsystem of the virus plus the formation of new viral genetic material leading to formation of whole\r\nviruses.\r\nThus in July 1985 a patient\r\nwas given the drug. This was followed by more clinical trials end-\r\njug in regulatory approval of this\r\ndrug manufactured by Wellcome\r\nin March 1987.\r\nZidovudine is now linked to\r\nProlonging the life of Aids should also contain information on how the HIV\r\nIs not spread to help eliminate\r\nFear as discrimination can result\r\nIn Aids victims developing apathy at joining the war against its\r\nSpread. The virus is not spread by\r\nCasual contact at work school,\r\nShaking hands, touching or\r\nHugging.\r\nSpread through food\r\nOr water, sneezing, coughing.\r\nMust be remembered\r\nits price still remains prohibitive\r\nand this is even more when as a\r\npatient has to be given treatment against side-effects. More\r\nResearch is still being conducted\r\nand more drugs are being developed although  none of them\r\nhas clear indications of being able\r\nto eliminate the virus- Indeed up\r\nto now viral diseases can only be\r\nprevented through vaccination or\r\nimmunisation which stimulates\r\nthe body to produce effective\r\nantibodies against the diseases.\r\nAnother drug said to hays been\r\nDeveloped in Zaire MMl \r\nactivity still remains to\r\nbe verified. The World Health\r\nOrganisation recently agreed to\r\nhelp in financing and evaluating\r\nmore research into MM1 activity\r\nagainst HIV has yet to be\r\ncertified by independent\r\nauthorities.\r\nBecause the Aids virus is capable\r\nof hiding inside the cells that\r\nhelp the body\ufffds defense against\r\nDiseases, an anti-HIV drug may\r\nalso have to possess the quality of\r\nentering into these helper cells\r\nand be selectively toxic to the virus without injuring the cells.\r\nWithout the ability to eliminate the HIV, drugs may only offer temporary solution to the\r\nproblem.\r\nEven more attempt to find a vaccine. It was initially assumed that through\r\nsect bites, swimming or even toilet. "}
