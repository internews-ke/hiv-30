We called him\r\nRejoice. He grew well, ate well.\r\nbut when he was a few months\r\nold he stopped growing. He jot\r\nthin. He drank lots of milk but\r\nalways had diarrhea. Then he\r\ngot a rash and a few weeks later\r\nhe died. My neighbor said he\r\ndied of Slim.\ufffd\r\nMother-to-child transmission\r\nof Slim the Ugandan name for\r\nAida, is an increasing worry, especially in countries such as\r\nUganda where producing children\r\nis central to a woman\ufffds acceptance in society.\r\n\ufffdThe nurse at the clinic said\r\nthat Rejoice might have died of\r\nSLim,\ufffd Mary recalls. \ufffdBut he\r\nmight have died of something\r\nelse. If it was Slim, then he got it.\r\nfrom me, b.\ufffd,re he was born. She\r\nsaid I could have a blood test to\r\nfind out if I have Slim. But how\r\nwould that help? I would still\r\ndie.\ufffd\r\nTesting people for Aids \ufffd only\r\nuseful If there are resources for\r\ninformed counselling to go with\r\ntesting. Resources in most Third\r\nWorld countries are scarce\r\neven the most. basic needs and\r\nthere are few trained counsellors\r\navailable.\r\nEven telling their own families\r\nis often out of the question for\r\npeople who discover they carry\r\nthe virus.\r\nMary can predict her family\ufffd.\r\nreaction. \ufffdMy husband would\r\nthrow me out of the house. Then\r\nwho would look after the children? My husband does not know\r\nhow to look afterthem. If I die he will move to another village, far\r\naway, where no one knows him.\r\nHe will take another wife there.\r\nHe will not tell this new wife\r\nabout me, or the baby, or his\r\nchildren.\ufffd\r\nNor can the traditional family\r\nsupport network of mothers and\r\nsisters be relied upon. \ufffdMy moth\r\ner will not look after the children,\r\nnot if I dia of Slim. Nor will my\r\nsister,\ufffd says Mary, categorically.\r\nBecause of the stigma attached\r\nto Aids, people who carry the virus or are HIV-positive find it\r\nharder and harder to bold jobs or\r\neven stay in their villages.\r\nWomen are the first to be cast\r\nout on the least suspicion that\r\nthey may b. infected. This is because women are still unjustly\r\nviewed u the source of sexually-transmitted diseases, even if they\r\nhave only ever had one partner."}
