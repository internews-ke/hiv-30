{"text": "NATION TUESDAY SEPTEMBER, 5 1989\r\nCONDOMS NO SUBSTITUTE TO FIDELITY\r\n\r\nAt last week\ufffds seminar for\r\njournalists on Aids, Professor Joseph Oliech, the Director of\r\nMedical Services, warned\r\nthat Aids threatened our survival and that of future generations. Are condoms the\r\nanswer against this threat?\r\n\r\nDOROTHY MUNYAKHO\r\nparticipated at the seminar\r\nand gives her view.\r\nAt last week\ufffds two-day seminar\r\nfor journalists on Aids, this message recurred constantly: chastity\r\noutside marriage and fidelity\r\nwithin it arc the best safeguards Aids, but where this is\r\nto apply, condoms to minimise the fact, condoms have become\r\nintegral to the global Aids con\r\ntrol campaign that one may be\r\nforgiven to suppose that the two\r\napproaches \ufffd chastity and fidelity on one hand, and condoms on\r\nthe other, are interchangeable\r\noptions.\r\nThe liberal provision of\r\ncondoms at the seminar display\r\nthey disappeared testifies to the\r\nimportance that has come to be\r\nattached to condoms as a shield\r\nagainst the spread of Aids.\r\nI was one of the panelists invited to address the topic: \ufffdHow\r\njournalists can help to change at\r\ntttudes and sexual behaviour\ufffd\r\nPromiscuous sex has all alon been associated with the sprea of Aids, and one would have expected the media to preoccupy itself with how best to transmit\r\nmessages that emphasise the apposite of promiscuity. Not quite, the message was, clearly, abstinence and marital fidelity for those who can practise the twin\r\nvirtues, arid condoms for those\r\nwho cannot.\r\nA brief overview of how the\r\nabove message was put across\r\nwill suffice.\r\nEven after a highly positive\r\nmessage which decried the glorification of sex, use of sex appeal\r\nin advertising, sexy music and\r\nlove songs, the director of Medical Services, Professor Joseph\r\nOliech, still found it necessary to\r\ndigress and say: \ufffdWe need the\r\ndisc jockey at the night club to\r\ntalk about Condoms.\ufffd\r\nProf. Oliech had pinpointed the.\r\nsocial approval of having many\r\ngirls and hoyfrieds and extra\r\nmarital affairs as being conducive\r\nto the spread of Aids.\r\n\ufffdBecause of Aids, we are telling\r\npeople now that all that is wrong\r\nand risky; that this has to change for their survival and the survival of future generations,\ufffd the\r\nOMS had said. Still, he found a\r\nplace for condoms, if only in one\r\nsenteqce, thereby diluting the\r\nvery powerful message he had put across.\r\nThe deputy programme man\r\nager of the National Aids Control\r\nProgrammes (NACP), Mrs Margaret Gatel asked: \ufffdIs abstaining\r\npractical? If not, why ,alk about it?\ufffd\r\nWhile acknowledging that condom promotion\r\nAnd while acknowledging that some Kenyan men\r\ncannot use condoms because of\r\ntheir communities\ufffd style of circumcision; and which further acknowledging that some condoms\r\nwere inappropriate for Kenyan\r\nmen by virtue of their size, Dr. Owili, who has chaired the clinical sub-committee of the NACP\r\nstill thought that condoms should\r\ncontinue to be promoted for AIDS\r\ncontrol, provided that their promotion is accompanied by educe.\r\ntion on their proper use.\r\nThe chairman of NACP,\r\nformation, Education and \r\nNACP\ufffds stand on condoms say\r\ning: \ufffdIn the absence of anything\r\nelse, what can we do?\ufffd\r\nIt is important to note that Dr\r\nMulindi and his colleagues all\r\nagreed that condoms are not fool\r\nproof as shield against Aids, and\r\nthey are only offered as an option\r\nfor those who cannot abstain\r\nfrom sex or be faithful to their\r\nmarital partners.\r\nI could go a step further and\r\nrule condoms out\ufffd altogether be\r\ncause not only do they reinforce\r\nsexual attitudes conducive to the\r\nspread of Aids and other sexually\r\ntransmitted diseases, but they\r\nalso offer a false Sense of security.\r\nOn average, 10 out of every \r\nwomen using condoms as a contraceptive device become pregnant, and there is no reason why\r\nthe condoms safety record should\r\nbe better in Aids prevention. The\r\nAids virus is infinitely smaller\r\nthan the male sperm, and\r\nchances are that the failure rate\r\nof condoms in Aids prevention\r\nwill be even higher than in\r\ncontraception.\r\nThis failure rate is compound\r\ned by the fact that while women\r\ncan only get Pregnant on five\r\ndays within a menstrual cycle.\r\nthe risk of Aids, especially among\r\nthe high risk groups \ufffd notably\r\nthe prostitutes, is daily. And\r\nwhile it is only a woman who is\r\nCapable of pregnancy in case a\r\nCondom fails to prevent contraception, both married women\r\nrisk Aids in pronjij5 sexual encounters.\r\nIs it really true that there are people who will not change their sexual behavior even when it is a life and death matter?\r\nIf it be true, what are the real circumstances that make people impervious to change? Can they be altered?\r\nAt a recent workshop on Aids,\r\npart of the family life promotion\r\nof Ox-ford, England, addressed this\r\nsame issue. Why are people not\r\nchanging their habits in spite of\r\nknowing all about Aids?"}
