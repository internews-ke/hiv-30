{"text": "Monday September 11, 1989\r\n\r\nTell us more about Aids carriers\r\n\r\nIn Kenya we have about 200,000\r\nAids carriers, according to the\r\nDirector of Medical Services, Dr. Joseph Oliech,\r\nHowever, many Kenyans wonder what steps the Ministry of\r\nHealth is taking to let the public\r\nknow who is suffering from the\r\ndisease and who is not.\r\nThe Aids carriers have been let\r\nto mix freely with other Kenyans.\r\nIs this the way to control the\r\ndeadly disease?\r\nReaserchers from the University of Nairobi. the Institute of\r\nTropical Medicine, Belpum. and\r\nthe University of the Manitoba in\r\nCanada have found a very high\r\nrate of female-to-male transmission of the HIV.\r\nA recent report has revealed\r\nthat uncircumcised men take a\r\nparticularly high risk of contract\r\ning the Aids virus from HIV-positive women if at the same time\r\nthey have been exposed to other\r\nsexually transmitted diseases\r\n(ST\ufffds).\r\nIf the compaign to prevent the\r\npread of Aids is to succeed, the\r\nGovernment should do the fol\r\nlowing: Ask all uncircumcised\r\nmen to be circumcised and send\r\nhighly qualifed doctors to Zaire\r\nto do a thorough research on the\r\ndrug which was discovered by\r\nZairean and Egyptian doctors\r\n(MM1).\r\nThe Government should issue\r\nhealth certificates to all barmaids\r\nindicating whether they are Aids\r\ncarriers or not.\r\nW are told that more than 90\r\nper cent of prostitutes may be in\r\nfected with HIV. It means the\r\nMinistry of Health knows the\r\npeople with Aids and has just let\r\nthem infect other people.\r\nMiheso wa Amagalu,\r\nChamakanga."}
