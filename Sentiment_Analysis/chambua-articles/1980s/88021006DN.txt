{"text": "WEDNESDAY 10 FEBRUARY 1988\r\nANTI-AIDS SQUAD GRAPPLES WITH THE DEADLY SCOURGE\r\n\r\nWhen American epidemiologist and public health expert\r\nDr Jonathan Mann arrived at\r\nthe Geneva headquarters of\r\nthe World Health Organization just over a year ago, he faced the daunting task of\r\nbattling a new, little-understood afflication that had\r\nsuddenly become a feared\r\nglobal epidemic.\r\nIt was the time when the\r\nWHO, the specialised agency of\r\nthe United Nations that rid the\r\nworld of smallpox and had been\r\nin the forefront of worldwide\r\nhealth efforts for four decades,\r\nsuddenly found itself facing a\r\nnew epidemic \ufffd Aids.\r\nFor 40-year-old Mann, the\r\nchallenge was to organise the\r\nWHO\ufffds Special Program on Aids\r\nwhile at the same time putting\r\nthe programme to work.\r\nFor the WHO in general, it was\r\na question of mobilising forces\r\nquickly to meet an ever-rising total of Aids cases, which by mid-November had risen to 64,488 of\r\noficially reported from 127\r\ncountries.\r\n\ufffdIt was a lot like trying to build\r\nthe boat and sail it at the same\r\ntime,\ufffd said Mann in an interview.\r\nToday, the phrase has become\r\nsomething of a motto around the\r\ncorridors of the WHO headquarters. The Special Programme on\r\nAids - known by its acronym\r\nSPA \ufffd has become the\r\norganisation\ufffds fastest-growing\r\nprogramme, expanding to new\r\ncountries and territories nearly\r\nevery day.\r\n\ufffdWhen the programme first began functioning about nine\r\nmonths ago, there was a staff of\r\n\r\n\r\nBy THOMAS W. NETTER\r\nTwo - me and my secretary,\ufffd\r\nMann said.\r\n\ufffdSince then we\ufffdve expanded to\r\na staff of 60, from no national\r\nprogrammes to more than 93,\r\nand from no financial support to\r\n$25 million this year.\ufffd\r\nAt the same Lime, the SPA has\r\norgansied 32 conferences on global research and policy issues, in\r\ncluding major meetings on the\r\nAids epidemic in the Americas,\r\nEurope, Africa, Asia and Oceania, and published more than 30\r\nconsensus statements on complex\r\nhealth policy and technical issues.\r\nThese include screening for\r\nthe human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes Aids, Aids\r\nand international travel, contraceptive methods and their relationship to HIV, childhood\r\nimmunisation, and breast feeding\r\nand breast milk and HIV.\r\nThe programme also has over\r\nseen the allocation of $21 million\r\nin bilateral aid for full funding of\r\nfirst-year national Aids programmes in Uganda, Tanzania,\r\nRwanda, Kenya and Ethiopia.\r\n\ufffdk is quite simply a situation\r\nwhere the Special Programme\r\nhas delivered more than we\r\npromised,\ufffd Mann said.\r\nAs with the fight to eradicate\r\nsmallpox, the WHO Aids programme has received international backing for its activities, including unanimous resolutions by\r\nthe World Health Assembly in\r\nGeneva in May and the UN (General Assembly) in October, where\r\nAids became the first public health issue ever to be discussed\r\nby the assembly in special session. UN officials, say this is extraordinary in itself.\r\n\ufffdAt a time of growing scepticism about multilateral activities.\r\nthis programme is a good example of how an international agency can respond to global concerns,\ufffd one UN official said recently.\r\nAids was first recognised in the\r\nUnited States in 1981. It has now\r\nattacked every part of the world\r\nand shows no signs of waning.\r\n\ufffdThe trend is up in every single\r\nregion in the world,\ufffd said Dr. James Chin, a Special Programme official responsible for\r\nworldwide surveillance and monitoring.\r\nAccording to the most recent\r\nfigures, Aids is continuing to take a grim toll.\r\n\ufffd The largest number of cases,\r\nclose to 45,000, are in the United\r\nStates. In 40 other countries in\r\nthe Americas \ufffd north, central\r\nand south \ufffd more the 6,000 cases\r\nhave officially been reported.\r\nIn the Americas, We8tern\r\nEurope and Australia most cases\r\noccur among homosexual or bisexual men and intravenous drug\r\nusers aged 20-49.\r\nHowever, it is estimated that\r\nthe proportion of cases acquired\r\nthrough heterosexual contact has\r\nincreased from \ufffd per cent to 4 per\r\ncent over the past several years.\r\nThe US Public Health Service\r\nestimates that by 1991. 270,000\r\ncases will have occurred in the\r\nUnited States, nearly five times\r\nthe total reported worldwide so\r\nfar.\r\n\ufffd In Europe, 27 countries have\r\nreported more than 7,500 cases,\r\nand most countries aie now considered in the grip of an epidemic. The highest per capita rates\r\nhave been reported by Denmark, France and Belgium.\r\nThe WHO estimates that\r\n500,000 to one million people in\r\nEurope are infected with the Aids\r\nvirus, and that 25,000 new cases\r\nwill be registered by the end of\r\n1988.\r\nIn Africa, the number of\r\ncountries reporting cases has\r\nincreased substantially over the\r\npast year, in large part due to\r\nefforts by the WHO and African\r\nnations to co-ordinate activities\r\nto fight Aids.\r\nAs of mid-November, 37 African nations had reported more than 6,000 cases, but as in other regions of the world, the WHO believes the real total is larger.\r\nMajor sources of infection in urban areas of Central Africa include heterosexual transmission\r\nand transfusions with unscreened blood. Mother-to-child transmission is another serious problem, especially in areas where 5-10 percent of women have been red as HIV positive.\r\n\ufffd Asia is the least affected region, with a little more than 200 cases reported by 18 countries.\r\nMany of those cases have been\r\nlinked to people who have been in\r\nother areas where Aids is more\r\nprevalent.\r\n\ufffd Oceania has reported a total of nearly 700 cases, mostly in\r\nAustralia and New Zealand South Pacific island nations such as the Solomon and Marshall islands, Tonga and French Polynesia, which have reported virtually no cases, are to become\r\nthe focus of a new WHO effort expand into areas where case low or non-existent.\r\n\ufffd Compass News Features"}
