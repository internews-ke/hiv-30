{"text": "NATION DECEMBER 1 1988\r\n\r\nTHE WORLD FOCUSES ON AIDS AS IT CONTINUES TO DEFY A CURE\r\n\r\nBy OTULA OWUOR\r\nAids has ousted mankind right\r\nTo the edge of the precipice.\r\nAt the beginning of Last month\r\ncases of Aids worldwide had\r\nreached 125,000 by one reckoning\r\nand 300,000 according to the\r\nGlobal Programme on Aids\r\n(GPA) of the World Health\r\nOrganisation.\r\nThe figure of suspected carriers\r\nof the human immune deficiency\r\nvirus which courses the Acquired\r\nImmune Deficiency Sydrome disease paints an even gloomier and\r\nhopeless picture, WHO estimates\r\nthat 10 million people are carriers. Five years ago, WHO could\r\ntalk of only 20 cases.\r\nThis dramatic increase in the\r\nnumber of Aids victims has\r\ngalvanised medical scientists and\r\nothers in related fields into intensive research in a bid to find a\r\ncure for the dreaded disease.\r\nIndeed, up to last year, most of\r\nthe global energy on Aids was directed at guessing the origins of\r\nthe killer disease while much efforts was also spent on blood\r\ntests to determine which grouped\r\n\ufffdtested moat positive\ufffd.\r\nMany groups especiafly Africans found themselves being\r\nblamed as sources of the mysterious killer disease with the monkeys being earmarked as\r\nsources of the ancestors of Aids virus.\r\nAmericans found themselves\r\non the receiving end of world with accusations that they\r\nhad been involved in the genetic\r\nengineering of the deadly virus.\r\nAs the racial and geopolitical\r\ndimensions of Aids intensified,\r\nmoney and publicity-hungry researchers sounded endless alarms\r\nwith increased positive tests\r\nbased on imperfect test kits.\r\nAll these tended to downplay\r\nthe \ufffdimportance of co-operation in combating Aids and increased\r\nsuspicion. There was concensus\r\namong scientists that knowledge\r\nof the origin of Aids would help\r\nin finding ita cure or even a vaccine and may also help in establishing control measures. However\r\n, the research work seemed\r\nunprofessional and did not anticipate the basic reasons.\r\nStill efforts to deal with the\r\ndisease seemed hampered by a\r\nbelief that resulted from early\r\nepidemiology of the disease\r\nwhich at first seemed prevalent\r\namong homosexuals and intravenous drug addicts.\r\nIt was also noticed that the virus could be transmitted among\r\nheterosexuals. This remaining the\r\npredominant mode of transmission in Africa where men and\r\nwomen seem to be infected in equal ratios.\r\nRegular\r\nThose who receive regularly\r\nblood transfusions were also\r\namong the victims while prostitutes were quickly placed in the\r\nhigh risk groups.\r\nToday, as the world commemorates the first World Aid Day,\r\nmuch knowledge has been gained\r\nand a sober and positive approach to combat the disease\r\nemerged under the auspices of\r\nthe World Health Organisation.\r\nSome of false and outrageous\r\ntheories about the disease have\r\nbeen discarded and replaced by\r\nand accumulation of more reliable\r\ninformation about the disease.\r\nThis has resulted in more open Days about the disease.\r\nAlthough little information\r\nwas known about the HIV virus,\r\nin the aorta of experts kept accusing\r\nAfrican governments of \ufffdhiding\ufffd\r\nthe exact figure of the supposedly\r\nmillions of their suffering from the killer disease.\r\nAt the international level there\r\nis an increase in the number of countries that require \ufffdaids free\ufffd\r\nCertificates from visitors of these countries say that\r\nsince their Aide cases are few or\r\nNegligible, the \ufffdAids free\ufffd\r\ncertificates helped them in their\r\n\ufffdpreventive\ufffd measures especially\r\nnow that some tests are being developed to attempt to detect the\r\nAdvantages\r\nThe WHO warns that the disadvantages of such system may\r\noutweigh the advantages especially when health education\r\nabout the disease is neglected or\r\nFor Africa the number of confirmed Aids cases is increased rapidly and governments will\r\nhave to double their anti-Aids\r\ncampaign efforts.\r\nBy the beginning of last month, the continent had about\r\n20,000 cases of Aids in 45 countries. Africa is now second to North America with 16 per cent\r\nof the global total.\r\nKenya, Uganda, Tanzania,\r\nCongo, Zaire, Burundi, Rwanda,\r\nZambia and Malawi have the\r\nhighest number of aids victims\r\nand the health authorities an\r\n. these countries are already doing\r\ntheir best to curb the spread of\r\ndisease.\r\nUnfortunately HIV infection\r\nseems to predominantly spread\r\nthrough heterosexual contact and\r\nthe disease has not been confined\r\nto specific groups. Indeed the\r\ntheory of assuming that the disease is only confined to certain\r\ngroups can spell disaster because\r\nAids has no boundaries, and this\r\nis rapidly becoming clear.\r\nAfrican countries are already\r\nbeing forced to spend their meagre resources to combat the disease. Initial hopes that a cure\r\nwould be found soon through\r\nhigh tech seems to have only thing left is prevention of HIV infection.\r\nThis involves people sticking\r\nto their sex partners, screening of\r\ntransfusion blood for HIV infection, use of condoms (although this may not be a guarantee), plus\r\nthe use of sterile syringes and needles in all immunization programmes.\r\nIn Africa, there is now a need\r\nto sterilise al] items used in piercing or cutting or lacerating the\r\nbody. This means that sterile\r\nknives must be used in all circumcisions done in villages.\r\nInfact, circumcisions may finally\r\nhave to be done in hospitals.\r\n, Even barbers must be told that\r\nthere is still some element of defy\r\nwhen their unsterilised razors are\r\nused from one customers to\r\nanother.\r\nHowever, it must be said that\r\nthe spread of Aids through such\r\nactivities like circumcision and\r\ntraditional lacerations have been\r\nExaggerated by the foreign media\r\nand researchers. But this does\r\nnot mean there is no element of\r\nrisk. Health education on the\r\nprevention of Aids must be extended to these groups.\r\nAids tests are now increasingly\r\naccurate. They are being handled\r\nwith caution after years of misuse\r\nof data collected after testhg van communities. Tests are also\r\nbecoming cheaper and quicker.\r\nthough many companies still see\r\nit as multi-million shilling business that will thrive for several\r\ndecades.\r\nLiterature\r\nIndeed anyone who has read\r\nthe Aids Literature on Africa\r\nquickly notices that it was initially based on deficient tests. This\r\nresulted in a number of publishing a highly\r\ninaccurate picture of Aids in Africa.\r\nAnyone who read the first Panes Institute\ufffds report on Aids\r\nin the Third World and compared it with the revised third\r\nedition, found shocking inaccuracies in the first one have changed.\r\nExperts say that the Aids virus\r\nmay be found in every body fluid\r\nincluding urine, sweat, saliva, semen and even breast milk\r\nHowever, blood and semen remain effective transmission media.\r\nAfrican countries must preparing\r\nto deal with the increased number of Aids patients. Reports indicate that even the Zaire\r\n least effective and an increasing number of patients an\r\ngoing to herbalist whose activities must now be close)\r\nmonitored.\r\nFinally, the highest number of cases still exist \ufffdn the America\r\nthough a decline is predicted \r\nnear future especially in\r\nCanada has over 2,000 cases\r\nBrazil 3,700, Mexico over 1,500\r\nwhile Haiti has 1,455. Europe u\r\nnow third with a Lutai of 15,34(\r\ncases or about 12 per cent o:\r\nglobal total.\r\nAsia seems to be lucky and if ii\r\ncan maintain effective healt\r\neducation campaigns it ma\r\navoid the Aids epidemic. A total\r\nof 281 cases have been reported\r\nfrom 22 countries.\r\n. On the whole the World Aids\r\nDay should be used to help every-\r\none realise that despite being in.\r\ncurable, Aids can be prevented\r\nstopped and every individual \r\nthe ability to do this. It should\r\nalso be a day to teach many\r\npeople the various aspects of the\r\ndisease and how it should b\ufffd\r\nhandled."}
