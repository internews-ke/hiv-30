{"text": "SUNDAY NATION OCTOBER 1, 1989\r\nWho says Aids can\ufffdt be cured?\r\n\r\nThe failure to produce an effective Aids cure may be called a\r\nScientific misunderstanding over\r\ncertain important issues concern\r\ning HIV and its effects.\r\nWhite some scientists have said\r\nits origin is Africa, others have\r\nblamed a laboratory cross breeding of certain viral species in an\r\nadvanced nation. Whichever is\r\ncorrect, the fact remains that HIV is already rampant\r\nAn effective cure cannot be\r\nfound until somebody comes up\r\nwith a proper and acceptable explanation as to how HJV causes a\r\nrange of diseases. Most micro organic diseases can be explained as\r\nfreely affecting the body of a HIV\r\ncarrier due to the reduced concentration of T-Helper cells (the natural body defence) in the blood.\r\nBut what about the range of\r\ncancers affecting the carriers and\r\nthe relationship between HIV\r\nand the formation of cancers?\r\nThis actually shows that a lot of\r\ninformation has been left out,\r\nleading to a wrong approach to.\r\nthe Aids issue and making it seem impossible to cure.\r\nI strongly believe Aids can be\r\ncured and that HIV can be made\r\nto socialise with the human Body\ufffds activities, thus reducing danger to human life.\r\nJameson Kimong.\r\nMombasa."}
