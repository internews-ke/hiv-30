{"text": "NATION FRIDAY JUNE 19, 1987\r\n\r\nNOW TWILIGHT GIRLS DEMAND THE CONDOMS\r\n\r\nBy WINNIE OGANA\r\nTwilight girls in Kenya are charging their clients a Little extra. In\r\nthe wake of the Aids scare, the\r\ncost of a condom is being included in the total charges. Following\r\na research carried out in Nairobi\r\nsome of the girls now insist that\r\ntheir clients use the much condom which before the\r\nAids scare, was used only by a few.\r\nA team of medical researchers\r\nbegan studying a group of prostitutes of low economic status in\r\n1985, The prostitutes were educated on Aids and other sexually\r\ntran8mitted diseases through barazas, during clinic visits and\r\nthrough individual counselling The study, carried out by Bosire, L J. D. Costa, J. O.\r\nNdinya-Acbola. E. N. Ngugi and F. A. Plummer, concentrated on a\r\nNairobi slum, Puinwani.  The slum, with a geographic area of\r\nless than oe square mile, was\r\nchosen for its uniqueness. In this\r\nspace it houses some 600 prostitutes, who service men\ufffds \r\nneeds for between Sh5 and above.\r\nAccording to the research, each\r\nwoman averages 1,000 sexual \ufffd\r\npartners a year.\r\nNew members\r\nIn June, 1986, free condoms\r\nwere distributed to the Pumwani\r\ntwilight girls on demand. Last\r\nNovember, this group was enlarged though the recruitment of\r\nnew members. These women\r\ncome from the same community\r\nas the original group but had not\r\nreceived any special AidS or STD education although they had at\r\ntended the barazas.\r\nCondom use by the male partners was reported by 41 of the 42\r\noriginal group members 24 and of\r\n36 new members. The mean percentage of sexual encounters involving condom use was 50 percent in the original group and 33 per cent among new members.\r\nCondom use in either group\r\nwas rare or non-existent prior to July 1986 and has gained popularity increasing rapidly since.\r\nThe female partner suggests the\r\nuse of the condoms in the majority of cases. The frequency of\r\ncondoms their use seems directly related to\r\n, the quality of education received.\r\n\ufffd There has been a significant\r\n,iHover on the use of condoms\r\nfrom the group to the community. As the Aids phobia grows - December 1986, 250 cases of\r\ndisease had been diagnosed and death toll had reached 38 more clients are beginning to use\r\ncondoms.\r\nDoctors estimate that of Kenya\ufffds population of 20 million, in\r\nNairobi one to two per cent of the\r\npopulation has Aids, which has\r\nbeen spread mainly through heterosexual contact.\r\nIn 1980, the Pumwani prostitutes were tested for the Aids\r\nHIV virus, and none of them had\r\nit. In 1983, they were tested again\r\nand 53 percent were HIV\r\npositive. Now over 80 per cent\r\ncarry the virus.\r\nToday, the women know a I\r\nabout Aids and realize most o\r\nthem are likely to develop it by\r\nvirtue of their work. They have\r\nbegan to use condoms as far as\r\nAids is concerned. They are also\r\nconcerned over the rate of the\r\nrest of the community.\r\nThey now know unless their\r\nclients wear condoms, they (The\r\ncall girls) stand a good chance of\r\ncontracting Aids, and that the will spread it to prostitutes\r\nelsewhere, and to innocent family\r\nmembers like wives and unborn\r\nchildren. A recent survey shows\r\nthat 100 men who visited\r\nPumwani and had sex with HIV\r\npositive women, 8 per cent be\r\ncame infected.\r\nAids -may not be rampant in\r\nKenya, bat unless precautions\r\nare taken now, this country\r\nmight fall into the same plight as\r\nneighboring Uganda where\r\nWestern media claim the number\r\nof Aids cases is doubling every six\r\nmonths and op to 10 per cent of\r\nthe sexually active population is\r\ninfected with the virus.\r\nAnti-Aids posters and leaflets\r\nare now being distributed in areas\r\nlikely to harbor the virus.\r\nFor years there may be no cure\r\nor vaccine against Aids, but the\r\ncondom may remain, as it is to\r\nday, the only real preventative in\r\nthe battle against the dreaded\r\nkiller disease.\r\n\ufffd APS Feature"}
