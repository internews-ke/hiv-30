Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (Aids).\r\nYou do not have to be homosexual or addicted to drug to gel\r\nAids, although those two groups as well as hemophiliacs. are considered at the highest risk.\r\nA transfusion can transmit the\r\ndisease, and that has stirred fears\r\nunabated by assurances From\r\nexperts that the actual chances of,\r\ngetting Aids from a transfusion at\r\nthis point appear minuscule.\r\nSome experts say commercial\r\nfrom paid donors is more likely to carry Aids and hepatitis\r\nthan blood [rum unpaid donors.\r\na contention refuted by he\r\nIndustry and the US Food and\r\ndrug Administration.\r\nOthers, including the Inter\r\nnational Red cross, believe it is\r\nsimply immoral to profit from\r\nblond and want to replace the\r\nApproximately 20 multinational\r\ncommercial blood firms with\r\ngovernment or volunteer\r\nprograms.\r\nBut tens of thousands of\r\nHemophiliacs in Western Europe\r\nand the rest of the world depend\r\nheavily on commercial blood\r\nproducts.\r\nGovernment programme and\r\nthe Red Cross, which provide an\r\nAdequate supply whole blood,\r\ncannot now meet the demand for\r\nplasma and other blood\r\nderivatives and it would cost\r\nmillions of tax dollars to till the\r\ngap.\r\nSo about 70 per cent of the\r\nworld\ufffds plasma and blood\r\nproducts comes from commercial\r\nfirms. And almost all of that\r\ncomes (rom paid donors in the\r\nUnited States.\r\nThe commercial industry\r\nproduces about 65 million litres\r\nof plasma a year, according to\r\nInternational Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufactures\r\nAssociations (IFPMA) in Zurich.\r\nAbout 25 per cent is sold in North\r\nAmerica. 41 per cent is exported\r\nto Europe. 29 per cent to Asia\r\nand 5 per cent to Latin America\r\nand the Middle East.\r\n (hit or Merchandise that in\r\n19M, the American cosmetics\r\ngiant Revlon earned $85 million\r\n(Shl.16 billion) from the sale of\r\nblood products. In that same\r\nyear, the West German pharmaceuticals Bayer earned\r\n$130 million (8h4.52 billion),\r\nwhile the US drug company\r\nHaxter-Travenol took in $345\r\nmillion (Sh4.75 billion), he says.\r\nHagen, who coined the \ufffdOpec.\r\nof blood; phrase, says all three\r\nfirms used blood from paid\r\ndonors in the United States.\r\nWell informed public health\r\nsources outside the industry say\r\nthe commercial companies are\r\nethical firms which invest heavily\r\nin the research that has been\r\nresponsible (or all the recent\r\nmajor breakthroughs in the field.\r\n\ufffdPeople just get emotional\r\nbecause it involves human\r\nblood,\ufffd said a representative of\r\nthe World Health Organisation\r\nGeneva, who requested\r\nanonymity. \ufffdThere\ufffds also a little\r\npolitics involved. The Red Cross\r\nmay be a little jealous about the\r\nindustry\ufffds success in its\r\ntraditional domain.\ufffd\r\nThe Food and Drug\r\nAdministration, which sets strict\r\nrules for blood collection in the\r\nUnited States, has stated that\r\n\ufffdno available data\r\nplasma from\r\npaid donors is less safe than non\r\ncommercial plasma.\r\nThe WHO official says\r\nthe typical paid donor is more\r\nlikely to be a \ufffdstrapping young,\r\ncollege football player who needs\r\na little extra cash for a weekend\r\ndate.\ufffd\r\nHut after recent headlines\r\nthroughout Western Europe\r\nabout Aids \ufffd dubbed here the\r\n\ufffdgay cancer from America\ufffd \ufffd\r\nthe European Parliament called\r\nfor total European self.\r\nsufficiency in blood and blood\r\nproducts from non-commercial\r\nsources.\r\nOfficials  of the Institute\r\nPasteur Production in Paris,\r\nwhich manufactures an anti-\r\nhepatitis vaccine from blood,\r\nheld a news conference earlier\r\nthis month to announce they had\r\nall injected themselves with a\r\nbatch of the vaccine to prove to\r\nthe public that it was safe.\r\nThat  extraordinary measure\r\nwas taken after the newspaper\r\nLiberation revealed that the\r\ninstitute, short of non-,\r\ncommercial French plasma, had\r\nproduced the batch from\r\nAmerican commercial imports\r\nwithout informing its customers.\r\n\ufffdThe incident also embarrassed the French Government, which had gone out of its\ufffd\r\nway earlier to assure its citizens\r\nthat France was self sufficient in\r\nblood and blood products.\r\nDr  Juhan Likola, director of blood programmes for the League\r\nof Red Cross Societies in\r\nGeneva, insists there is some difference in the safety between\r\nCommercial and non commercial plasma, but adds that \ufffdas far as\r\ntransfusions are concerned. Aids.\r\nhas been exaggerated.\ufffd\r\nIt is an argument \ufffdthat reaches.\r\nalmost theological proportions.\ufffd\r\naccording to Mr Frank Schnabel,\r\npresident of the Montreal.\r\nbased World Federation  of\r\nHemophilia. \ufffdIt gets very\r\nemotional.\ufffd\r\nAnd it is an argument, accompanied by scare headlines, that may be frightening people unnecessarily and endangering -the lives of hemophiliacs lea\r\nof continuing life-sustaining treatment.\r\n\ufffdThere is a real fear of Aids\r\namong hemophiliacs and their\r\nfamilies \ufffdyoung parents worried\r\nabout treating their children. A panic.\ufffd said Mr Roger Barilliet.\r\nsecretary-general of the Association of French Hemophiliacs.\r\nThe danger of hepatitis \ufffds much\r\nmore serious, and hemophiliacs\r\nare well aware of that risk. For\r\nsome reason Aids scares\r\nhemophiliacs more than\r\nhepatitis,\ufffd he said.\r\nBy all accounts, the chances of\r\ngetting Aids from a transfusion\r\nare minuscule, But nine\r\nheterosexuaI hemophiliacs in the\r\nUnited States, three in Spain and\r\none in Canada have died of Aids,\r\nfollowing transfusions,  SchnabeI says. \r\n\ufffdThere\ufffds a kind of hysteria about Aids, but we\ufffdre losing more hemophiliacs due to the withholding of treatment by doctors worried about Aids of frightened patients withdrawing\r\nIron) treatment than we\ufffdre losing to Aids,\ufffd he said.\r\n\ufffd AP"}
