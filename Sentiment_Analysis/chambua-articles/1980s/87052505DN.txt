{"text": "May 26 1987\r\nWHO disputes Aids Theory\r\n\r\nBy NATION Reporter\r\nA theory that the smallpox vaccine may have triggered off the scourge has been dismissed by the World Health Organisation. According to Dr Jonathan Mann director of the WHO special programme on Aids, the link age of Aids to smallpox joins many other unproven arid speculative ideas about the origin of\r\nthe disease. Dr Mann was reacting to a report in The Times of London.\r\nwhich claimed that Aids might have been started by the mass vaccination campaign which eradicated smallpox.\r\nThe article by the newspaper\ufffds science editor, Mr. Pearce Wright,\r\non May 11, said WHO, which\r\nmasterminded the 13-year campaign, was studying new scientific evidence suggesting that\r\nImmunisation with the smallpox vaccine \ufffdvaccine\ufffd awakened the unsuspected dormant human immune-defence virus infection (HIV). \r\nA minor Third World endemic into the present epidemic. Dr Mann explained that smallpox. Was an ancient scourge and the smallpox vaccine was used widely in many areas of the world\r\nduring the last two centuries. During all this time, neither the smallpox disease virus\ufffd nor\r\nthe vaccine virus was ever linked to upsurges in any other disease,\ufffd\r\nhe said.\r\nIn Asia where hundreds of millions of smallpox vaccinations were  from 1967 to 1972, Aids is rare.\r\nConversely, the US has a major Aids epidemic, yet smallpox was eradicated there many years ago.\r\nAs many doses of smallpox vaccine were given in West Africa as in Central Africa: yet Aids is common in West Africa than Central Africa. Dr Mann said."}
