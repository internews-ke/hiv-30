{"text": "NATION FRIDAY DECEMBER 1, 1989\r\n\r\nHOW TO KEEP IT IN CHECK\r\n\r\nAlthough the infection caused by virus causing Acquired Immune\r\nDeficiency Syndrome (Aids) has\r\nno cure, it can fortunately be prevented from spreading and it is\r\nupon individuals to help in the\r\nwar against the disease other.\r\nwise, it will end up killing millions in all parts of the world during the next decade.\r\nThe Kenya National Aids Control Programme directs most of\r\nits efforts \ufffd manpower, equipment and other resources \ufffd towards the prevention of infection\r\nby Aids virus and health education campaigns on various aspects of the disease have been\r\nspread to all parts of the country.\r\nThe disease can be crushed if\r\npeople change their sexual habits\r\nand avoid high risk behavior.\r\nThis first means that people\r\nmust stick to their sexual\r\npartners.\r\nAids virus in Kenya is mostly\r\nspread through heterosexual activity which is sex between men\r\nand women.\r\nThe chances of getting Aids is\r\nvery high if one has different sex\r\npartners.\r\nHigh risk behavior also involves acts of homosexuality.\r\nIntravenous drug use and sharing needles.\r\nSex with prostitutes greatly increases the risk of getting infected although anybody with multiple sex partners faces the risk.\r\nThe use of condom although\r\nnot 100 per cent safe has been\r\nfound capable of reducing the\r\nrate of infection.\r\nThere are now condoms designed for women and since Aids\r\nhas no cure, anything that may\r\nreduce the chances of infection\r\nlike a condom should not be\r\nignored as a fire fighting device.\r\nIt should be ensuring that only\r\nblood screened for the presence\r\n.of Aids virus and found to be negative is given patients.\r\nThose involved in high risk\r\nbehavior should avoid donating\r\nblood.\r\nThe transmission of the Aids\r\nvirus through blood transfusion\r\nhas been reduced by the establishment of blood screening facilities in all parts of the hospitals\r\nand transfusion facilities in the country.\r\nAs the Ministry of Health demands the transfusion of blood is\r\nonly acceptable in cases where it is critical.\r\nThis reduces the chances of giving patients blood that may have been negative although it\r\nhas the virus.\r\nAll skin piercing instruments including needles and syringes\r\nmust be sterilized or discarded after use.\r\nThus some items used in cultural activities like ear piercing.\r\nmaking scars, and others must be\r\nsterilised or discarded.\r\nCircumcision should be per\r\nformed in hospitals otherwisei.it\r\nis a must that, the knives or other\r\nitems used must be gerilised or\r\ndiscarded after each act.\r\nBarbers must sterilise or prop\r\nerly discard their razors.\r\nHow to keep it in check\r\n\r\nFRONTLINE AGAINST A GLOBAL KILLER\r\nAnd functioning autoclaves or\r\nsterilisers and syringes.\r\nThe strategies also involve promotion of condom use. Although\r\ncondoms are not 100 per cent\r\nsafe their use is recognised as capable of helping reduce the rate\r\nof infection.\r\nAs a whole, the Aids control\r\nprogramme has developed nearly\r\n50 well defined or specific activities aimed at the controlling the\r\nspread of HIV infection.\r\nThe intensfied campaigns\r\nthrough radio, television, print\r\nmedia, end other channels of\r\ncommunication is part of the efforts by the KNACP to control\r\nthe disease.\r\nr Effective health education, information on prevention of the\r\ndisease is still a major activity\r\nbecause the disease has no cure\r\nand may not be found even by the\r\nend of the century.\r\nother words, every attempt\r\nng made not only to inform\r\neducate people about the disease but also to make them\r\nchange any risky behaviour.\r\nKenya Aids newsletter has also\r\nbeen established and is published\r\nevery two months.\r\nIt deals with all known aspects\r\nof the disease.\r\nThe members of the NAC with\r\nthe newly established APS are in\r\nthe frontline of being with an aspects of the problems of Aids.\r\nThe present chairman of the\r\nNAC is Dr J. B. Were who is the\r\nhead of the clinical research section of the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) and he\r\ntook over from professor Mr. Mugambi the former director Kemri.\r\nDr Were is one of the medical\r\nexperts in the country who paid\r\nclose attention to dealing with\r\nsome of the first Aids patients in the country.\r\nHe has worked with others like\r\nDr D. M. Owii, a leading consultant dermatologist and Dr. Acheta, a leading microbiologist from the University of Nairobi Medical School.\r\nAta time when medical experts\r\nin all parts of the world seemed\r\neven afraid of dealing with clinical aspects of Aids, our experts\r\nwere busy determining its local\r\nclinical aspects.\r\nTh Al\ufffds is headed by Dr Theresa Mulandi and was initially\r\nheaded by Dr Frank Mueke one of the most experienced and long\r\nserving medical experts in the\r\ncountry. .\r\nDr Mulandi is supported by a\r\ntireless team that includes Mrs Margaret Gatei.\r\nHowever, the Aids control\r\nprogramme is not just confined\r\nto the capita] city or big urban\r\nareas.\r\nLocal health authorities in all\r\nparts of the, country are now able\r\n1to deal with various aspects of\r\nthe disease.\r\nThis has been achieved\r\nthrough hard work by the NAC\r\nvia the Ministry of Health.\r\nIndeed the Minister for Health,\r\nMr Mwai Kibaki, has told health\r\nworkers that Aids control programmes have to be integrated\r\nmto the primary health care activities and must not be seen as a\r\ndifferent problem which can only\r\nbe dealt with once in a while.\r\n\ufffdThe people in the remote rural villages must be told about\r\nAids and how they can protect\r\nthemselves against this dreadful\r\ndisease.\r\nThe Director of Medical services Professor J. Oliech recently\r\nmet with local mass media and\r\nurged them to help in informing\r\nand educating the public about\r\nthe incurable disease.\r\nThe only effective weapons we\r\nhave against Aids is to prevent it\r\nfrom spreading and this means\r\ndoubling our efforts to make\r\npeople stick to their sexual\r\npartners.\r\nProf Oliech is keen on seeing\r\nactivities linked to information,\r\neducation, and communication\r\nsub-section of the NAC\r\nstrengthened.\r\nThe challenge has already been\r\ntaken by a hardworking and determined chairman, Dr Sobbie A.\r\nZ, Mulindi.\r\nHe has launched numerous lectures on the disease in secondary\r\nschools, coLleges, and other institutions of learning and training\r\nin all parts of the country.\r\nAt the international level the\r\nWorld Health Organisation\r\n(WHO) realised the deadly impact (including social, political\r\nand economic) the disease poses\r\nfor mankind and moved quickly\r\nto provide leadership needed to\r\ndeal with this major global\r\nmenace;\r\nThe WHO established a special\r\nprogramme on Aids which was\r\naccepted by its executive board\r\nand in February 1987 it was\r\noperational.\r\nThus the special programme\r\ncalled Global Programme on Aids\r\n(GPA) was founded. Meanwhile,\r\nanother experts committee, the\r\nglobal commission on Aids was\r\nfounded and two Kenyan scientists are members.\r\nThe (WA is headed by Dr Jonathan Mann who has had wide\r\nexperience with various aspects\r\nof the disease in Africa.\r\nThe WHO involvement has\r\nhelped awaken global communities to join forces against this di-\r\nraster and nowadays much effort\r\nis geared towards dealing with\r\nwhere the disease is going than\r\nwhere it came from.\r\nIndeed initially the disease\r\ngenerated much controversy\r\nwhich resulted in the\r\n\ufffdpoliticisation\ufffd of the disease\r\nwith Africans feeling they were\r\nbeing accused without valid\r\nproof that the continent was the\r\nsource of the incurable infection.\r\nFrontline against global killer"}
