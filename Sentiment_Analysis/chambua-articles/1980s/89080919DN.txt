{"text": "WEDNESDAY AUGUST 9, 1989\r\nINFECTIOUS SPLASH OF THE THEATRE\r\n\r\nBy EVA NDAVU\r\nTheatre Spiask \ufffd89 was an evening of infectious laughter presented by Theatre Workshop Kenya at four varied venues last weekend. TWK is the culmination of a five-week workshop, a\r\njoint effort by Nairobi and Kenyatta universities in-cooperation\r\nwith Big Wheel Theatre Company of Oxford.\r\nTheatre Splash \ufffd89 was devised by TWK participants from\r\ntheir own ideas and experiences.\r\nThe result is a variety show incorporating improvisation, mime,\r\nclowning and music. Comments\r\non everyday life in Kenya today\r\nproduce some hilarious comedy\r\nending in a historical footnote\r\nand an epilogue on Aida, the underlying fear of the 80s.\r\nThe show takes off with a precarious matatu ride into oblivion.\r\nThis is followed by everyone\ufffds\r\nfavourite pastime: Meat-roasting.\r\nTension slowly builds as Obyero odhyambo mounts a riotous depiction of one professor\ufffds\r\nsolution to the 8-4-4 curriculum.\r\nThe absent-minded professor\r\nruns onto stage trouser less but\r\nwearing white lab coat an immediately rattles off a nonstop lecture in which he promises to\r\nteach 15 subjects in just as many\r\nminutes. Out come statistics on\r\nchemical formula, grammar rules,\r\nradiocarbon dating and every\r\nology and jam ever dreamed up\r\nby academics to torture the\r\nminds of would-be graduates.\r\nThe plot is aided by walking\r\ntable and chalkboard, both of\r\nwhich prove inadequat. for his\r\nteaching tirade. When he runs\r\nout of chalkboard space continues writing his notes across\r\nthe stage floor and finally into\r\nthe wings, leaving everyone\r\nbreathless with educati3n jargon\r\nand stupor.\r\nThe next sketch takes us to a\r\nChristmas party at the mental\r\nhospital. Mueni Laundries in\r\nvain to keep order while serving\r\n-refreshments but the festive\r\ndance activities soon deteriorate\r\ninto happy chaos.\r\nNightmares, a ghost marriage\r\nscene and a cothic routine entitled: \ufffdAnd the Dance Continues,\ufffd\r\nlead into the trai-comic sketch\r\nabout slavery. Finally, there is a\r\nten-minute time capsule which\r\ncombines the precolonial, colonial and post-colonial history of\r\nKenya.\r\nThis neatiji contrived\r\nprogramme sets the stage for the\r\nTheatre-in-Education playlet on\r\nthe subject of Aids. Kenyatta\r\nUniversity students enacted several instructional scenes about\r\nmisconceptions, scientific explanations and consequences of the\r\nmodern-day worldwide plague.\r\nEspecially effective was the\r\nsketch where actors take the roles\r\nof Healthy Body. Immune System, Malaria, Cholera, Flu and\r\nHIV Virus villain. Guess who\r\nbreaks through the barrier to\r\nattack Healthy Body.\r\nThis modern-day morality play\r\n(in more ways than one) recalls\r\nPilgrim\ufffds Progress in its personification and allegory. It is also\r\none of the moat creative approaches PVC seen in dealing with\r\nthe issues, especially for a younger, audience. It combines instruction with entertainment to\r\nReinforce the main ideas and is a\r\neffective as an earlier animated\r\ntelevision special VD blues.\r\nWith the Aids sketch, Theatre\r\nin-Education Workshop has clearly demonstrated how drama\r\ncan enhance teaching programmes. Care was taken to follow Government guidelines \r\nAIDS awareness. The play explains the scientific facts concerning the Aids virus and it!\r\ntransmission. It also deals with the social aspects of the disease,\r\nin particular how an AIDS victim should be treated. With emphasizing the seriousness of\r\nthe problem, the final message positive, compassionate and\r\nhopeful.\r\nThe BBC is looking for plays for its six-week 1989 Africa\r\nTheatre Series late this year.\r\nProducer Janet Anderson is soliciting English scripts no longer\r\nThan 30 minutes and with cast\r\nnot exceeding six characters.\r\nPlays must be set in Mrica an\r\nshould have good dialogue am\r\nstrong characterisation.
