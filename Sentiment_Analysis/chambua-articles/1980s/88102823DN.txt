{"text": "NATION FRIDAY OCTOBER 28, 1988\r\nAIDS TESTS ARE NOT USEFUL DURING LATENCY PERIODS\r\n\r\nSo far in this series we\r\nhave Iooked into the\r\nnature of the virus that\r\ncauses Aids and how\r\nthe disease develops.\r\nIt has come out clearly that a person may have the\r\nHIV infection but remain\r\nhealthy and without symptoms and yet be able to give\r\nthe virus to other people who\r\nmay then develop complications much sooner, such\r\nas people are known as healthy\r\ncarriers and can be detected\r\nby testing their blood for\r\nantibodies.\r\nThere are two tests currently\r\navailable for HIV antibodies-\r\nThese are Elisa and the Western\r\nBlot tests. Elisa is the short form\r\nof a much longer name \ufffd enzymes\r\n\ufffd Linked \ufffd Immune Sorbent\r\nPurified several times so that\r\nToday it is highly sensitive though\r\nnot confirmatory. It detects antibodies to HIV proteins. In only a\r\nfew cases it can indicate that the\r\nantibodies are present when in\r\nactual fact they are not present\r\n(false positive). However this is\r\nin a very small percentage.\r\nElisa test is used mainly for screening tests. All bloods for\r\ntransfusion are screened in this country, using the Elisa test.\r\n\ufffdThose found positive are discarded straight away. Elisa is also used as first stage test for those\r\nIf positive in \ufffdthe first test it may be repeated after some time,\r\nto see if it is still positive. However a more confirmatory test, the\r\nWestern Blot, which is more sensitive can then be carried out. If this is positive then it is\r\nconfirmatory.\r\nIf a person is negative on Elisa but positive on Western Blot, the latter\ufffds result is taken as final. On\r\nthe same strength if a person is\r\npositive on Elisa but negative on\r\nWestern Blot then he is regarded\r\nas not having MIV antibodies.\r\nRemember these tests detect\r\nantibodies and may not be useful\r\n\ufffdduring the latency period - i.e.\r\nbetween the actual MIV infection\r\nand the appearance of antibodies.\r\nWe have discussed at length\r\nthe various signs and symptoms.\r\nof Aids. But what we have not\r\ndone is to discuss what actually\r\nkills people with Aids. Those\ufffd\r\nsigns and symptoms are as a re\r\nsult of complications that arise\r\nbecause the body cannot defend\r\nitself from other infections because the immune defense system\r\nis destroyed by the HIV. We will\r\ntherefore now discuss those infections that do eventually kill\r\nthe person.\r\nInevitably there will be difficult\r\nscientific names mentioned.\r\nThese infections are usually re\r\nferred to as opportunistic infections. They are opportunistic in\r\nthe sense that they take advantage of the body\ufffds lowered resistance and multiply to the, extent\r\nthat they cause complications.\r\nIt is not easy to categorized\r\nthese into distinct compartments\r\nwithout overlapping but for our\r\npurposes we will divide these opportunistic infections into four\r\nbroad categories depending on\r\nwhich system of the body they\r\npredominantly attack. These are\r\nthe respiratory system, the brain,\r\nthe gut and the skin or dose to\r\nthe skin.\r\nThe best known opportunistic\r\ninfection involving the respiratory system predominantly is the\r\npneumocystis caring pneumonia. The bug is a kind of parasite, Like the parasite that causes\r\nmalaria. This infection is found\r\nalmost exclusively in persona\r\nwith immune deficiency, whatever the cause of this deficiency.\r\nThe symptoms include fever,\r\nchills, cough and shortness of\r\nbreath. Life threatening failure of breathing may occur and this of\r\nten kills.\r\nThe other common respiratory\r\nrelated infection in Aids is tuberculosis. But it seems to set in\r\nwith a lot of relative ease in those\r\nwho have reduced immunity. In the case of Aids the TB may involve other sites of the body not\r\nusually affected by the disease.\r\nThere is of course effective treatment for TB and therefore Aids\r\npatients with this infection tend\r\nto respond well to treatment primarily aimed at the TB.\r\nThere are two types of opportunistic infections involving the\r\nbrain. These are so called Cryptococcus meningitis and the central nervous system toxoplasmosis. The first one is caused by covering of the brain. This leads\r\nto low-grade fever and mild head\r\nache, nausea, vomiting and\r\nblur\ufffdd vision may occur.\r\nThe patient is progressively lethargic. If a person is not treated\r\nhe/she will die of this infection.\r\nEven with treatment, 25 per cent\r\nof those with this infection will\r\ndie of it.\r\nCentral nervous system toxoplasmosis is caused, again by a\r\nparasite and involves the brain\r\ntissue itself. It will present with\r\nfever, headaches, lethargy, confusion, seizures and interference fatal.\r\nTwo infections predominantly\r\nrelated to the gastro-intestinal \ufffdsystem. This are so called cryplospondians and (ITALL).\r\ncandzasis. The first one is again\r\ncaused by a kind of parasite. It causes debilitating diarrhea,\r\nwhich may last for weeks or\r\nmonths and is very difficult to\r\ntreat. Other symptoms of\r\ncryptosporidiosis include:\r\ncramps in the abdomen, fever,\r\nnausea and vomiting. The diarrhoea can be severe enough to cause dehydration and death unless patients have body fluid replenished.\r\nCandidiasis (thrush) is caused\r\nagain by a fungus. It usually involves the mouth (oral candidiasis) leading to whit usually\r\npainles lessions in the mouth."}
