{"text": "Tuesday June 28th 1988\r\nAIDS CASTS A SHADOW OVER AFRICAN ECONOMIES\r\n\r\nBy FRANK BARTON\r\nIt is no longer far-fetched to\r\nspeculate that whole sectors of\r\nAfrican economies could be\r\nruined by the Acquired Immune\r\nDeficiency Syndrome disease.\r\nOnLy recently has the economic\r\ncosts of Aids been considered in\r\nany country, but now the expert are beginning to add up the figures and the likely consequences.\r\nOne way is to measure the loss of\r\nearnings by people killed or crippled by the disease. France has\r\njust done a reckoning and it says\r\nthat the number of years of life\r\nlost to Aids by 1990 will almost\r\nequal the number lost by traffic\r\naccidents.\r\nThe Palo Alto Medical foundation in California says the hidden\r\ncost of Aids in America by 1991\r\nwill reach about $55 billion.\r\nFor every person with Aids-\r\nanywhere \ufffd between 50 and 100\r\nothers are believed to be infected\r\nwith the human immune deficiency virus (HIV). How many of\r\nthese will go on to develop Aids\r\nitself is not yet known, but it may\r\nwell be half perhaps more.\r\nThe consequences will fall unequally on different parts of the\r\nWorld in Western Europe, Austria\r\nliable, partly because many African governments are unwilling to\r\nadmit the existence of yet another serious health problem and\r\nanyway lack the expertise to handle it of the total number of aids\r\nso far reported to the World Health Organisation only 12 per\r\ncent come from Africa. \ufffd\r\nThe cost of dealing with the\r\ndisease is sufficient to make African finance ministers just leave\r\nthe problem in their in-trays. The\r\nWorld Bank reckons that the cost\r\nof providing medical services for\r\nan HIV infected patient in Zaire\r\nranges from $132 to $1,585; in\r\nTanzania from $104 to the indirect costs may be many\r\ntimes this sum when the annual\r\nloss of earnings of the victims is\r\nreckoned with. Social customs\r\ncome into the total sum. \r\nExample,may spend a whole\r\nyear\ufffds earnings to mourn and\r\nbury a child, and many African\r\ncountries have similarly expensive funerals.\r\nDoctor Benjamin Nkowane, a\r\nscientist from the University of\r\nZambia, told the London confer\r\nence that the consequences of the\r\nlisease in his country were\r\nappollin if it spreas \ufffd as it is\r\nalready doing \ufffd through the con\r\ngested Copperbelt areas. The\r\ntens of thousands of miners in\r\nthe area between the ages of 20\r\nand 40 are \ufffdsexually active\ufffd and\r\ntheir wives will probably catch\r\nthe virus, too, and in turn pass it\r\nonto their children,\r\nAs the copper mines pay the\r\nmedical costs for miners and.\r\ntheir families an Aids case means\r\nmore than just a lost worker;\r\nmeans taking on the support of\r\nentire families.\r\nNo doubt one day the doctors\r\nwill come up with an answer to\r\na shadow over African economies.\r\nSouth America, most of the infection has so far been confined to\r\nhomosexuals, drug addicts who\r\nuse infected needles or people\r\nsupplied with contaminated\r\nblood products by unsuspecting\r\nhospitals. In Asia and the Arab\r\nworld few cases have been reported."}
