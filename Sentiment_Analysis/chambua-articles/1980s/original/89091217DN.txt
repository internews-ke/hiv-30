{"text": "NATION TUESDAY SEPTEMBER 12, 1989\r\nNEED FOR DEFINITE YOUTH AIDS POLICY\r\n\r\nThe National Aids Control\r\nProgramme may soon draft a\r\npolicy guideline on youth in aspect of the killer disease.\r\nDorothy Munyakho interviewed the NACP coordinator.\r\nDr. Therese Mulandi, \r\nThis year\ufffds Word Aids Day\r\n(WAD), December 1, has\r\nyouth as its focus. The theme\r\nof the day is: \ufffdOur lives, our-\r\nworld \ufffd Let\ufffds take care of\r\neach other.\ufffd\r\nAccording to the July-August\r\n1989 issue of the WA newsletter, published by the Global\r\nProgramme on Aids of the World\r\nHealth Organisation, young\r\npeople are critical to Aids efforts,\r\n\ufffdIt is often when they are young\r\nthat people begin to experiment\r\nwith sexual activity and, in some\r\nregions, drug injecting,\ufffd the\r\nnewsletter says.\r\nYouth, the newsletter says,\r\nmay be more likely than others to\r\nengage in risk behaviors, but are\r\noften less likely to be aware of the\r\nrisks of infection with the human\r\nimmunodeficiency virus (HIV)\r\nthat causes Aids.\r\nJune 1989 issue of Aids\r\non, a publication of the London based Appropriate Health\r\nResources and Technologies Action Group (AHRTAG) has\r\ndedicated substantial space to youth and Aids.\r\nSexual Except for a sentence on Sierra Leone, where a peer teaching\r\nprogramme has succeeded in.\r\ncreasing the percentage of young\r\npeople who plan to delay sexual\r\nintercourse until marriage, the\r\nrest of the information seems to\r\nbe headed in one direction: educate the youth on the need for\r\nand the correct use of condoms.\r\nThe newsletter also advertises\r\ntwo videos for young people,\r\nwhich barely disguise the condom\r\nmessage. Concerns regarding condoms as a safeguard against\r\nAids have already been expressed in this series, (See last week\ufffds),\r\nthe light of this thrust to use\r\ns as an excuse to hook young\r\npeople onto condoms and in\r\ncreased promiscuity, I had a talk\r\nwith Dr. Theresa M. the\r\nNational Aids coordinator and\r\nNeed youth Programme Manager, in which\r\nshe defined the program\ufffds\r\nstand on Aids, condoms and youth.\r\nThere is currently no written\r\npolicy on the matter, Dr Mulandi\r\nsaid. But she sees a need for one.\r\n\ufffdThe Aids Programme Secretariat (APS) has devised guidelines\r\nfor testing for HIV infection and\r\nfor counselling on MIV. There is\r\nno reason why we should not also\r\nevolve guidelines on how to deal\r\nwith youth.\ufffd she said.\r\nAccording to Dr Mulandi,\r\n\ufffdthere should be a very strong\r\nprogramme and policy guidelines\r\non how to deal with youth. There should be proper direction from\r\nparents and all responsible\r\npeople who deal with youth\ufffd.\r\nShe repeated President Moi\ufffd\r\nconcern recently expressed in\r\nMombasa that young people lack\r\nguidance. Although the President\r\nwas specifically addressing the\r\nproblem of corruption, Dr\r\nMulandi felt that his remarks\r\nwere applicable to young people\ufffds\r\nsexual behaviour.\r\nDr Mulandi Is not alone in her\r\nconcerns aboi.t lack of parential\r\nguidance in sexual matters affect\r\n4ng young people. One of the big\r\ngest excuses for Promoting\r\ncondoms (or contraceptives in general) for young unmarried people is that they are already\r\nsexually active.\r\nAt the recent family life promotion congress in Nairobi,\r\nmany family life education sessions were dedicated to this prob1cm. \ufffdt was recognized at the congress that yes, young people do engage in sexual activity. But\r\nrather than leave it at that, the\r\nparticipants delved deeper into\r\nthe causes of the problem.\r\nWhy do young people who are\r\nnot ready for marriage engage in\r\nsex?\r\nIn his paper entitled A psychosocial presentation on adolescent\r\nfertility management by education,\ufffd Dr. Raphael Wanjohi, the\r\nVice Rector of the Catholic Higher Institute for Eastern\r\nfor\r\nAfrica, tackled the problem of\r\nlack of parental guidance. The\r\npaper focused on boys unlike\r\nmost of the studies on adolescent\r\nfertility, which have tended to\r\nover-exploit the girl factor.\r\nPre-znarjtal sex among boys\r\nwhose communities practise circumcision as a rite of passage is\r\nlargely a result of peer misinformation and lack of parental guidance in respect of simple facts of\r\nlife.\r\nAccording to Dr Wanjohi, most\r\nboys experience frequent penile\r\nerection and nocturnal emission\r\nat puberty. Peers tell them that\r\nboth are due to excess sperm or\r\nlack of intercourse, and a major\r\nity of the boys go ahead to enga\ufffde\r\nin sex As a cure for the twin\r\n\ufffdproblem\ufffd.\r\nThe interesting tact about Dr\r\nWanjohi\ufffds research is that be\r\ntween 76 and 89 per cent of the\r\nboys think that they would have\r\nbeen different if they had re\r\nceived proper education earlier,\r\nand regret having gone astray.\r\nThe small proportion of boys who\r\nrefuse pre-marital sex as a therapy for their penile erections and\r\nnocturnal emissions are proud of\r\ntheir virginity\ufffd\r\nEducation\r\nOnly five per cent of the respondents to his questionnaire\r\nsaid that proper education would\r\nhave made no difference in their\r\nlives. .\r\n\ufffdCorrect family life education\r\nfor youth, honest information devoid of aU manipulation is necessary at this age to enable them to\r\nchoose with an informed conscience. Informed decision implies that they have been made\r\naware of the negative and moral\r\nside-effects of the contraceptives,\ufffd Dr Wanjohi says.\r\nDr Wanjohi, who has studied\r\nmorals and clinical psy\ufffdhology,\r\nfeels that it is our duty to meet\r\nthe youth as persons. Their youth\r\nsexual identity crises are and will\r\nhave to be managed by correct\r\nses education or family life education, he says.\r\n\ufffdl\ufffdina sex education should respect them, youth, as persona,\r\nbut not less human beings, whose\r\nsexual instinctual urges can only\r\nbe controlled by adultery or pre\r\nmarital sex with the aid of \r\nand condom,\ufffd he says.\r\nIn a strong appeal to our\r\n\ufffdpriceless African and Kenyan\r\ntraditional values\ufffd, Dr Wanjohi\r\nsays: \ufffdThe youth liberation philosophy through indiscriminate\r\ndistribution of the contraceptives\r\nwill just breed kinds of all\r\nkinds of venereal diseases, infertility, abortion and decimation if\r\nnot extinction of our African\r\npeople through Aids.\ufffd\r\nProposals\r\nIn the recent past, Dr Mulandi\r\nhas got proposals and has gone\r\nahead to enlist the support of two\r\nuniversity-based groups \ufffd the\r\nAids Awareness Programme\r\n(AAP) and the Association of\r\nMedical Students University of\r\nNairobi (AMSUN) in Aids ethics\r\ntion for youth. Dr Mulandi gives\r\nthe rationale for accepting both\r\nthe AAP and AMSUN support:\r\n\ufffdWe realise that youth will listen\r\nmore to peers,\ufffd she says.\r\nAlthough there is no written\r\npolicy on Aida education and\r\nyouth, the Director of Medical\r\nServices, Professor Joseph\r\nOliech, has asked the APS to direct both AAP and AMSUN\r\nwhenever they set out on their\r\nAids education missions, which\r\nare primarily targeted at in-\r\nschool and college youth. In respect of in-school youth, she says:\r\n\ufffdBefore they go out, we in\r\nstruct them clearly on what to\r\navoid saying. They are to avoid\r\npreaching about condoms. They\r\nare to speak about pre-marital\r\nchastity.\ufffd\r\nAt the recent Family Life Promotion congress, a delegate from\r\nPapua New Guinea. Ms Lucille Levasseur, underlined the same\r\napproach. Education alone, she\r\nsaid, was not enough to prevent\r\nthe spread of Aids. A sexual\r\nbehaviour revolution is needed.\r\nWe must get back to the basics\r\nsuch as what is love? What is the\r\nmeaning of genuine intimacy?\r\nWhat is the true relationship be\r\ntween partners who are gifts to\r\neach other?\r\nPeople, Ms Levasseur said,\r\nmust look critically at the proposition that the present sexual\r\nbehaviour is the \ufffdlife style\ufffd. They\r\nshould examine the outcome of\r\nthis proposition \ufffdand come to the\r\nconclu.jon themselves that\r\nchange must come about if they\r\nwant to survive.\ufffd\r\n\ufffdA renewed set of values and\r\nthe recovery of the virtue of chastity is paramount,\ufffd she said.\r\nDr Feljcjen Amani Adotevi, the\r\nAfrica Zonal Member of the International Federation for Family\r\nLife Promotion (IFFLP), who is\r\na psychiatrist based in Dakar,\r\nSenegal, told delegates that it was\r\nthose spots that were Left by parents that were filled by foreign\r\norganisations that preached luxury, depravity, wastage, pleasure\r\nand ease to the youth.\r\n\ufffdit is for rape of conscience\r\nand suicide of a nation that this\r\nshould persist.,\ufffd he said. \ufffd\r\nDr Adotevi described the condom approach to tackling Aids in\r\nyouth as a \ufffdfrightening and hope\r\nless technique.\ufffd\r\nDoctors, whos duty it is to\r\nprevent disease, should be singing\r\nto the youth the song of abstinence, which will appeal to the ,\r\ndreamy world in which they live,\r\nrather than distributing\r\ncondoms, Dr Adotevi said.\r\nShall we in Kenya adopt this\r\napproach or shall we be taken in\r\nby the condoms ruse, which is\r\npart of the alternative life style\r\nthat has brought us whe we are\r\nin respect of killer Aids?\r\nThe opinions in this article are\r\nthe author\ufffds and do not necessary fly reflect the newspapers\r\nstandpoint.\r\nDefinite Aids policy\r\nMother and child Aida victims in Uganda\r\n(File picture)"}
