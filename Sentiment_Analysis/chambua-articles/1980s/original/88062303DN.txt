Mbowa M. Kalengayi, who\r\nis attending a conference in Nairobi told the Nation that \ufffdpatients treated with the code-named MMI are surviving longer and improving while the untreated group had zero survival\ufffd.\r\nProfessor Kalengayi, who is also the president of African Organisation for Research and\r\nTraining in Cancer (AORTIC),\r\nsaid that of 25 patients treated\r\nwith MM1, only one died from\r\nbleeding linked to kaposi sarcoma, while 20 others who did not\r\nget MM1 have died.\r\nProf Kalengayi who arrived in\r\nNairobi from an international\r\nconference on Aids in Stockholm\r\nlast week said even the patients\r\nimmune system which is\r\ndestroyed by the Aids virus was being rebuilt.\r\n\ufffdSpecifically, our researchers have noted an increase in T4 and T8 lymphocytes which are the\r\ngroup of the body\ufffds white blood cells that are destroyed by the\r\nhuman immunodeficiency virus\r\n(HIV) causing Aids,\ufffd he said.\r\nProf Kalengayi, who is also the\r\nvice-dean for research and post-drug says graduate education at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Kinshasa, said clinical trials with\r\nMMI cover 200 victims.\r\n\ufffdAll sorts of things have beer\r\nsaid about this drug discovered\r\nby Professor Lurhuninn.\r\nZirimwabagaho and Dr Ahmed\r\nShafik of Egypt, but everything\r\nthey are doing is scientific and\r\nprofessional,\ufffd he added.\r\nThe announcement that African doctors discovered a cure for Aids has been met with skepticism even by other African medical experts.\r\nProf Kalengayi said that unlike\r\nAZT which is being used to treat\r\nAids is several countries, MMI\r\nhas not exhibited toxic side effects and although many patients\r\nare Zairan, there are some from\r\nCongo and Europe.\r\nHe said MM1 also acts as an\r\nanti-viral drug.\r\nProf Kalengayi said MM1 is\r\npresently being produced in small\r\nquantities in Egypt because it has\r\nrelatively better facilities and\r\nmanpower needed in production\r\nof the drug.\r\nHe said Prof Lurhuma is an\r\nexpert on the body\ufffds defence system against diseases,\r\nProf Kalengayi said that as it\r\nhas no toxic effects, the cost of\r\nMM1 will be very cheap compared to AZT."}
