{"text": "THURSDAY SEPTEMBER 21 1989\r\n\r\nIN THE WEST THE SALE OF CONDOMS EXPLOITS COLOR\r\n\r\nBy BUNMI MAKINWA,\r\nDAKAR Wednesday\r\n\r\n\ufffdWhat colour do you prefer,\r\nyellow, rose or sky blue?\ufffd\r\nasked the attendant in the\r\npharmacy. The customer was\r\nnot going to buy ribbons but\r\ncondoms. Now they come m\r\nmany colours and scented too\r\n\ufffd mint-flavoured, chocolate\r\nor embossed with rose petal.\r\nThese producta may not be\r\navailable on the streets of\r\n. Nairobi, Harare, Cairo or Dakar\r\nbut it is the trend in North Amer-\r\n\ufffdca and Europe. The aim is to\r\ngenerate increased interest in the\r\nuse of the protectives, the most\r\neffective way to prevent the\r\ntransmission of the HIV, Aids virus during sexual intercourse.\r\nThe campaign \ufffdn the Aids\r\nglobal epidemic, which the World\r\nHealth Organisation (WHO) estimates has affected over 500,000\r\npeople worldwide, three times the\r\nnumber of cases declared officia]\r\nly by 177 countries as at last\r\nmonth, focuses on prevention es\r\nthere is no cure for the killer diease. In Africa, at the same peri\r\nod, 30,244 cases of Aids have\r\nbeen declared, most of them\r\ntransmitted during heterosexual\r\nintercourse. .\r\n\ufffdParticularly in Africa. the use\r\nof condoms can stem the tide of\r\nthe rising number,\ufffd said a official\r\nAt the recently concluded 39th\r\nWHO regional African meetin\r\nin Niamey, Niger, WHO\ufffds Afn\ufffd\r\ncan regional director, Mr Gottlieb\r\nMonekosso, reported that sub\r\nSaharan Africa, \ufffdwill register a\r\ntota] of one million cases of Aida\ufffd\r\nbetween now and 1992, adding\r\nthat there were about 2.5 million\r\nAids seropositive people in the\r\nregion.\r\nMds seropositive people may\r\nnot show cases of MI-blown Aids\r\nsometimes until eight years after\r\ntheir infection by the virus. They\r\ncan, therefore, continue to infect\r\nothers unknowingly. .\r\nThe cost of condoms is a set\r\nback to its use in many parts of\r\nAfrica.. \ufffdThe money for a packet\r\nof three (condoms) can buy me a\r\ngood lunch,\ufffd argued a journalist\r\nin Kinsha&s. A report in the lat\r\nest edition of the Aids Watch\r\npublication quoted Dr Samuei\r\nOkware, head of Uganda\ufffds Aids\r\ncontrol programme es saying,\r\nyou go into a village and man with a torn shirt, it\ufffds likely\r\nthat his condom is torn too.\ufffd\r\nThe chances are that even the\r\ntorn condom was given to him\r\nfree, The WHO, United States,\r\nAgency for Internationai Devel\r\nopment and some governmental\r\nand non-governmental\r\norganisations make available to\r\ndeveloping countries millions of\r\ncondonas which, however, fall\r\nshort of demand. And even where\r\nthey are available, religious and\r\ntraditional norms sometimes pre\r\nvent their being distributed\r\nfreely.\r\n\ufffdIt is just not done. You cannot\r\ngo around work-places here dis\r\ntributing condoms\ufffd, said Kwadi,\r\nan undergraduate in Cheikh Anta\r\nDiop University in Dakar, \ufffdAnd\r\nif you dare do such a thing in a\r\nhigh school, no matter at what\r\nlevel, man\ufffdi people will be\r\nscandalised\ufffd, she added although,\r\nshe admitted many high school\r\nstudents do engage in sexual\r\nintercourse.\r\n\ufffdThe issue is how to motivate\r\nbehaviour on the use of condoms\r\nand, further, to use them effi\r\nciently,\ufffd explained Dr Patrick\r\nFriel of the WHO global\r\nprogramme on Aids. Dr Friel told\r\nPana recently that policy-makers\r\nhad a \ufffdhigh responsibility\ufffd to en\r\ncourage the use of the protective,\r\nwhich, apart from limiting the\r\nspread of aids, alzo protects users\r\nagainst sexually transmitted dis\r\neases (STDs).\r\nManufacturers and health\r\norganigation contend that\r\ncondoms have become a lot more\r\neffective. Critics who argue that.\r\n. they break during use or some\r\ntimes slip off the male organ are\r\ntold that such accidents ere due\r\nto misuse.\r\n\ufffdThough the instructions on\r\nthe use of these producta look\r\nsimple, many people do it\r\nwrong,\ufffd said Dr Friel, who is the\r\ncondom and virucide special\r\nthe WHO. \ufffdThese instruc\r\nshould be pictorial for low lite\r\npeople. It includes opening t\r\npackage carefully, piecing the\r\ncondom before any direct contact\r\nand rolling it on in the proper\r\nmanner.\ufffd\r\nHe continued \ufffdIt should be re\r\nmoved as soon as possible after\r\nejaculation, holding on to the rim\r\nto avoid slipping or spilling of the\r\ncontents. Uncircumcised persona\r\nshould pull up the foreskin before\r\nrolling on the condom.\ufffd\r\nHealth officials say that \ufffdsafe\r\nsex\ufffd or the use of condoms must\r\nbe made more exciting. They ar\r\ngue that condoms must no longer\r\nbe seen as \ufffdraincoats\ufffd or part of a\r\n\ufffdboring\ufffd or \ufffdYame\ufffd sex. In re\r\nsponse, manufacturers, have em\r\nbarked on the development of\r\n\ufffdattractive\ufffd condoms that appeal\r\nto various tastes.\r\n\ufffdIn just about every shape,\r\nsize, colour and even scent irnag\r\nmable.... (and packed in) elegant,\r\nblue plastic carrying case t\r\nyou could easily pasa for a\r\nup compact,\ufffd was how a wri\r\nthe fifth international conference\r\nin Montreal, Canada, in June de\r\nscribed the array of condoms pre\r\nsentad by the industries.\r\n. The latest development is the\r\nlong-awaited condom for women.\r\nThe device, made from polyure\r\nthane, is worn by the woman and\r\noffers the same kind of protec\r\ntion as that traditionally worn by\r\nmen. A diaphragm-like ring at\r\none end is inserted and held in\r\nplace by the pubic bone while an\r\nother ring at the opening of the\r\ncondom remains outside of the\r\nbody.\r\nEnthused Khady: \ufffdWell, that is\r\na good one. Now, women can take\r\nthe initiative and not always have\r\nto leave it to men to decide on\r\nwhether to use a condom or not.\ufffd\r\nThe product will be available as\r\nsoon as the inventor geta a manu\r\nfacturer to produce it.\r\nReporta from various parts of\r\nAfrica show increasing use of\r\ncondoms. National Aids \r\ntee officials say that e\r\ninto consideration local cultural affections,\r\npeople generally accept to use\r\ncondoms \ufffdand that is why we are\r\nrecording decreasing or at least\r\nno alarming rise of HIV\r\nseroprevalence among the high-\r\nrisk groups such as prostitutes.\r\nThey are accepting to use\r\ncondoms.\ufffd\r\nBut the worry \ufffdis among the\r\nso-called faithful couples where\r\nwe have witnessed an increasing\r\nnumber of MIV infections\ufffd, said\r\nDr Iba, Diop, secretary-general\r\nof the committee \ufffdn Senegal at an\r\nAids seminar in Dakar. (PANA)\r\nIn the West, the saie of\r\ncondoms_exploits colour\r\nThe negative attitude by most people towards the condom is\r\nbeing combated by manufacturers who are now producing\r\ncolourful decorated and scented condoms.\r\n\ufffdIf you go into a village\r\nand find a- man with a torn\r\nshirt, it\ufffds likely that his\r\ncondom is torn too\ufffd"}
