{"text": "THURSDAY DECEMBER, 1988\r\nA real threat to the future of MANKIND\r\n\r\nAmong those who might or\r\nhave already become victims\r\nof the dreaded Aids, none\r\nelicits more emotions of bitterness, frustration and hopelessness than a child.\r\nThe feelings are enhanced by\r\nthe realisation that whereas an\r\nadult can at least make certain\r\nconscious choices to minimise\r\nchances of contracting the disease, a child has no options. More\r\nso because children contract Aids\r\nmainly from two sources \ufffd their\r\nmothers either in pregnancy\r\nstages or after birth, and from\r\nmedical attention - contaminated blood, needles and syringes \ufffd\r\nail beyond the child\ufffds scope of options.\r\nAs Aide evolves in the current\r\nhistory of mankind, it has been\r\nestablished that so far no cure for\r\nit exists, that there is no\r\nimmunisation against makind \ufffd\r\ndeveloped so far, and that\r\nchances of survival for an infected person are not only nil but\r\ndeath comes within a span of a\r\nfew years at most. Viewed against\r\nthis background. Aids in children\r\nthen can only spell doom for the\r\nfuture of after all today\ufffds children\r\nare tomorrow\ufffds hope.\r\nChildren fall victims to Aids at\r\ndifferent levels. Infection with\r\nthe disease is one and by no\r\nmeans the least- But children are\r\nalso being orphaned daily when\r\ntheir parents die from the dis\r\nease, others become homeless\r\nwhile still many are abandoned\r\nwithout love and care by societies\r\nthat are still ignorant about the\r\ndisease, refusing to have anything\r\nto do with an infected person or\r\none who has ties to a patient \r\nUnavailable as statistics on\r\nAids and children in Kenya are,\r\nmedical authorities are concerned\r\nthat the need to protect children\r\nand unborn babies become\r\nknown to- each and every\r\nmwananchi. Some researchers\r\nsay that up to 50 per cent of children born to infected mothers be\r\ncome afflicted too before or after\r\nbirth.\r\nUnlike in industrialised countries, Africa baa the same number\r\nof women infected with Aids as\r\nmen. Most of the women infected\r\nwith Aids or who have tested positive with HIV are of child-bear\r\ning age and therefore stand the\r\nchance of passing on the disease\r\nto their babies.\r\nIn Znibia. for example, medical authorities fear that as many\r\nas 6,000 children in their infancy\r\nmay now have Aida. This figure is\r\nfifteen times as many as the\r\nUnited States.\r\nResearch is still being carried\r\nout to determine various factors.\r\ninvolved in the maternal trans\r\nmission of Aids to babies. Some\r\nfindings indicate that in some\r\ncases, babies may get Aida anti\r\nbodies from their mothers resulting in false positive tests. However, tests become negative after\r\nfour to six months and baby continues to thrive.\r\nBut not all babies born to\r\nmothers with Aids are equally\r\nlucky. Some end up being born\r\nwith the virus painfully convert\r\ning an occasion for celebration\r\ninto one for mourning \ufffd mothers\ufffd\r\nnursing role become a nurturing\r\nunto death.\r\nBut even as research continues\r\non the facts about Aids and children, medical authorities continue to emphasize on the need for\r\nCounselling expectant mothers on\r\nthe need to protect themselves\r\nhence protecting the unborn\r\nchild against Aids. According to\r\nDr M. Owili, women who have\r\ntested positive with HIV and\r\nthose who are already infected\r\nwith Aids should know the implications of becoming pregnant.\r\nSays Dr Owili: \ufffdAnyone who has\r\ntested positive with MIV should\r\nbe counselled not to become pregnant. She should know that the\r\nchances of passing the virus to\r\nthe unborn child are high and\r\ntherefore should in addition to\r\ntaking care not to infect her\r\nspouse, also ensure that she does\r\nnot become pregnant.\ufffd\r\nInfected husbands or MIV car\r\nriers should also know that in ad\r\ndition to infecting their wives,\r\nthis could trigger off a ripple effect where all children born to the\r\nfamily stand the possibility of being infected..\r\nIn cases where a woman is diagnosed with Aids or tests positive with HLV after she is already\r\npregnant, she is counselled on the\r\npossibilities of the unborn child\r\ncontracting the disease from her,\r\nand the consequences that the\r\nchild will be faced with if it be\r\ncomes infected. This may mean\r\nonly a very short life-span.\r\nWhether an infected pregnant\r\nmother should see the pregnancy\r\nto full term or not is ttl1 a moral\r\nquestion in Kenya. In some western countries, abortion is not\r\nonly recommended but also advised as an alternative to deliver\r\ning a child who has already condemned to death.\r\nThis is especially so because unconfirmed research findings\r\nindicate that the Aida virus in expectant mothers can be activated\r\nto a full attack during pregnancy\r\ndue to unknown factors. It is\r\ntherefore imperative that women\r\nshould on no account become\r\npregnant if they have contracted\r\nthe virus.\r\nOnce born to an infected mother, a baby begins life with a lot of\r\ndisadvantages, including the\r\nchoice of food. If to now it is\r\nstill recommended that mother\ufffds\r\nbreadmilk is best for baby. But\r\nmilk is also a bodily fluid and\r\neven though it is upto now considered a remote method of\r\ntransmitting the disease, the\r\nchoice to or not to breastfeed becomes burdensome for the moth\r\ners who care.\r\nNevertheless, in the absence of\r\nconclusive evidence that\r\nbreastmilk is a possible culprit,\r\nmothers infected with Aids\r\nshould continue to breastfeed especially in poor regions of the\r\nworld where nutrition is\r\nrampant.\r\nAs already established, Aids\r\ncan be transmitted through\r\nunsterile needle arid syringes.\r\nThis poses unsurmountable dangers for children who must undergo immunisation before the\r\nage of five. But the Kenya Expanded Programme on\r\nImmunisation (KEPI) is not only\r\nstriving to ensure that every child\r\nin the country ta immunised but\r\nthat the immunisation is done\r\nwith sterile needles and syringes\r\nto nile out chances of contracting\r\nAids and other infections via this\r\nmethod. Indeed, the WHO global\r\nsupported, Expanded Programme\r\non Immunisation (EPI) is now\r\nenforcing standards and procedures for sterilisation for immunisation instruments\r\nworldwide."}
