{"text": "SUNDAY NATION DECEMBER 3, 1989\r\nONE MANS FLING LEAVES 11 WOMEN WITH AIDS\r\n\r\nBoston: Eleven women, most of\r\nthem well-educated and middle-class, caught the Aids virus from\r\nthe same tnan, demonstrating the\r\npotential hazards of sexual relations even for those at seemingly\r\nlow risk, reseachers report.\r\nDoctors said the Cluster of in\r\nfection, spotted in Belgium, is the\r\nlargest to be documented among\r\nheterosexual since the epidemic\r\nemerged almost a decade ago. But\r\nit is probably not unique.\r\n\ufffdIn my view, it is only the tip\r\nof the iceberg,\ufffd said Dr Nathan\r\nClumecka of St Pierre University\r\nhospital in Brussels.\ufffd\r\n\ufffdIt\ufffds probably something that\r\nwill be more frequently described\r\nin the future among heterosexuals without apparent risk\r\nfactors.\ufffd\r\nDoctors who traced the spread\r\nsaid it should serve as a warning\r\nto women who believe they can\r\navoid the Aids virus by limiting\r\nthemselves to a few sexual\r\npartners.\r\nEmphasising only sexual relations with multiple partners as a\r\nrisk factor for women may be irrelevant and even counter production.\r\ntive since it implies that the absence of multiple partners makes women \ufffdsafe, the doctors wrote.\r\nThey said that middle-class women who think they are low risk because they don\ufffdt have sex with drug addicts or bisexuals or engage in other high-risk practices may have a false sense of security.\r\nDr. Clumeck is principal author\r\nof the report, published in a recent edition New England Journal of Medicine.\r\nThe detective work began in\r\n1985, when a Belgian woman in\r\nAntwerp was found to have Aids-\r\nrelated Symptoms. She said an\r\nAfrican man was the only person\r\nfrom whom she could have\r\ncaught the virus.\r\nDoctors interviewed the man\r\nand obtained the names of 19\r\nwomen with whom he had sex\r\nover the previous three years.\r\nEighteen of the women agreed to\r\nbe tested and li turned out to be\r\ninfected. These li named eight\r\n, other male sex partners, and one\r\nof these men was also infected\r\nwith hiv.\r\nThe m who spread the virus\r\nwas a civil engineer from Central\r\nAfrica who moved to Belgium in\r\n1963 but travelled frequently in\r\nparts of Africa where the Aids\r\nvirus is common among hetero\r\nsexuals. He died of Aids-related\r\nillness in 1986.\r\nAmong the 19 sexual partners,\r\n12 were Europeans, eight were\r\nmarried, and none used intravenous drugs. All said they had one\r\nto four sexual partners (luring the\r\nprevious three years. Two of\r\nthose who \ufffdot infected had sex\r\njust once with the African man.\r\n\ufffdWe have to be very, very care\r\nful, because the next step la the\r\nepidemic could well be a heterosexual wave,\ufffd Dr Clumeck said.\r\n\ufffdWithout panic, we have to take\r\nthat into consideration and de\r\nvelop public h\ufffda]th measures to\r\ncounteract it.\ufffd\r\n\ufffd AP"}
