{"text": "WEDNESDAY SEPTEMBER 7, 1988\r\nAIDS: ORIGIN NOT IMPORTANT\r\n\r\nBy JUDITH MARIASY\r\nIn 1987, a rumour spread that\r\nUS soldiers in Vietnam had\r\ncontracted the\ufffd Aids virus by\r\nhaving sex with monkeys, and\r\nhas then carried it back to\r\nthe United States and transmitted it to others.\r\nThis is just one of several variants of the \ufffdanimal origins\ufffd theories about the emergence of Aids\r\nthat have appeared and reappeared around the world. The debate about the origins of Aida has\r\nbeen hopelessly mixed with questions of who to blame for starting the epidemic. Implications\r\nthat particular people are to blame and feelings of being\r\nblamed have seriously hampered efforts to control Aids.\r\nA few years earlier, some US researchers speculated that a dis\r\nease of Haitian pigs could hold\r\nthe clue to the origins question.\r\nBut by far the most widely\r\npublicised animal origins hypothesis was based on the scientific\r\ndiscovery of a virus related to\r\nHIV, the Aids virus, in African\r\ngreen monkeys. Early in 1988,\r\nhowever, US scientists announced that their results were a\r\nmistake and the origins of Aids\r\nwere as unclear as ever.\r\nSimilary, the once prominent\r\ntheory that mv had existed, per\r\nhaps unnoticed for a long time, in\r\nisolated communities, has not\r\nbeen supported by teats of stored\r\nblood samples from Africa.\r\nHowever, very little research\r\nhas been done on the idea that\r\nthe Aids virus originated in the\r\nUnited States, As a result critics\r\nfelt that US reseachers had been\r\ntoo eager to pin blame on Africa\r\nand drew attention to what they\r\ncalled the \ufffdmissing hypothesis\ufffd \ufffd\r\none which would attempt to trace\r\nthe spread of the virus from the\r\nUnited States to the rest of the world.\r\nSpeculation that Defense Department germ warfare experimentation was responsible for treating the virus has circulated widely; but virologists are emphatic genetic engineering\r\nwas not sufficiently advanced to\r\ndevelop such a man-made virus\r\nat the time H]V first appeared.\r\nMeanwhile, no scientific theories\r\nfor the origin of HIV in the United States have emerged.\r\nSo far, we do not know the origin of the virus. How much then,\r\ndo we know about the earliest\r\ncases of HW infection and Aids?\r\nAids began to be noticed in the\r\nlate 1970e and early 1980e in several widely separated locations,\r\nincluding Belgium, France, Haiti, the United States, Zaire and\r\nZambia. In theory it ought to be possible to find out when and\r\nwhere the first cases of Aids occurred. In practice, this is not so\r\neasy.\r\nAnalysis of the medical histories of past patients has revealed a small number of possible Aids\r\ncases going back nearly 30 years\r\non three continents. Working\r\nback in time, Aids-like symptoms\r\nhave been found in patients as\r\nearly as 1959, when the trail, for the present at least, runs col&\r\n1979: A 44-year-old homosexual man died with Kaposi\ufffds Sarcoma in New York City;\r\n1977: A 27-year-old Rwandan mother developed the novel Immunodeficiency symptoms;\r\n1977: A 34-year-old Zairen airline secretary sought treatment\r\nin Belgium; she died in Kinshasa in 197& 1977: A 47-year-old Danish surgeon who had worked in rural\r\nZaire died in Denmark;\r\n1975: A previously healthy seven-month-old black infant had pneumocystis in New York City;\r\n\ufffd1969 A 15-year-old black US boy died with Kaporsi\ufffds sarcoma\r\nand opportunistic infections in St. Louis;\r\n1959: A British sailor with\r\nKaposi\ufffds sarcoma and\r\npneumocystie died in\r\nManchester\r\n\ufffd1959 A 45-year-old man boni in\r\nHaiti and long resident in the\r\nUnited States died.\r\nIn a few of these cases the diag\r\nnoses of Aide made after death\r\nare now supported by positive\r\ntesta for 141V antibodies in stored\r\nblood. Most, however, have been\r\nidentified as possible eariy cases\r\nof Aida on the basis of symptoms\r\nalone.\r\nTo date, the earliest known ev\r\nidence of antibodies to HIV has\r\nbeen detected in the stored blood\r\nand tissues of the St Louis teen\r\nager, mentioned above, who died\r\nin 1969 and in a blood sample\r\ndrawn in Kinsasha, Zaire, in\r\n1959.\r\nBut this samle was drawn a\r\nvery long time ago, and the older\r\nthe sample, the more difficult it is,\r\nto know whether the results are\r\naccurate. .\r\nNeither medical nor journalistic enquiry has managed to trace\r\nHIV infection or possible cases of\r\nAids further back than 1959. Earlier evidence of HIV infection or\r\nAids may still be found somewhere.\r\nDiagnoses of AIDS after death however, become more uncertain the further back in are Located. People do not die of Aids itself, for Aids is not really disease but a syndrome of opportunistic infections which strike when the immune system has been damaged by HIV. To determine some years later whether the infections that killed a person were actually part of the syndrome is, in reality, no more than cautious guesswork. The origins debate will continue. It may never be resolved. 1 hundred years after the appearance of a sudden and virulent epidemic of syphilis in Europe in the\r\n1490a, science still remains uncertain where and how it started.\r\nThen, as now, foreigners were\r\nusually blamed. Whether or not a full explanation for the origins of Aids ever\r\nemerges, the World Health Organisation and most specialists\r\nin this field stress that Aids education is not dependent on such\r\nan explanation.\r\nAs Zambia\ufffds President\r\nKenneth Kaunda has said:\r\n\ufffdWhat is more important than knowing where this disease came from is knowing where it is\r\ngoing.\ufffd\r\n\ufffd PANOS"}
