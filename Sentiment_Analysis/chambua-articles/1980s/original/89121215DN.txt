{"text": "TUESDAY DECEMBER 12, 1989\r\n\r\nA LIFETIME SUFFERING FOR KINS OF AIDS VICTIMS\r\n\r\nOrphan and child abandonment are just two of the social\r\nproblems which arise when\r\nparents die of Aids. Unicef recently sponsored a two-and-a\r\nhalf day seminar to discuss\r\nChildren, Victims of Aids.\r\nDOROTHY MUNYAKHO,\r\nwho attended the, seminar\r\n\ufffdreports .\r\nthe recent we kIong celebrations climaxed into World Aids\r\n. Day on December 1, a very crucial regional seminar on the topic\r\nr \ufffdChildren, Victims of Aids,\ufffd was\r\ng place at a ,Nairobi hotel.\r\nThe small number of delegates\r\nto the seminar (no more than 15)\r\nbelied the \ufffdseriOusness of the\r\npeople drawn from five countries\r\n,f the Eastern and Southern\r\nAfrica Region (ESAR) of the\r\nUnited Nations\ufffd Children\ufffds Fund\r\n(Unicef), namely Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, Zimbabwe and\r\nKenya.\r\nThe seminar, which you funded by the Primary Health Care\r\n(PHC) division of Unicef/ESAR\r\nwas organised by the Internation\r\nal Medical Women\ufffds Association\r\n(1MWA), whose vice presidency\r\nis in Nairobi,\r\nIn her opening remarks, Dr. Florence Mangyu, IMWA vice-president and also chairman\r\nKenya Medical Women\ufffds Association, stressed the fact that in the\r\nsituation, Aids is not a\r\ne for special risk groups\r\nhomosexuals, intravenous\r\ndrug abusers and prostitutes. It is a family disease.\r\n\ufffdWhen you see a child with\r\nAids, you can bet your life that\r\nthe mother, the father, the family\r\nhas Aids,\ufffd she said.\r\nIn Kenya, the tendency has\r\nbeen to associate Aids with wornen with high risk behaviour, or,\r\nprostitutes. If this assumption\r\nhs made us complacent, Dr. Ruth Nduati\ufffd revelation that 75\r\nper cent of prostitutes\ufffd clients are\r\nmarried men was sobering.\r\nDr Nduat\ufffd, a lecturer at the\r\nUniversity of Nairobi\ufffds College of\r\nHealth Sciences, also revealed\r\nthat seven per cent of housewives\r\npractise prostitution while their\r\nhusbands are at work.\r\nThe result is that there have\r\nbeen cases of wives who have\r\nbeen diagnosed to be positive in\r\nthe HIV virus that causes Aida,\r\nwhen their husbands were negative. This has almost invariably\r\nresulted in divorce. Where children are involved, the results are\r\nshattering. .\r\nWomen outside the normal\r\nfamily support system have been\r\nknown LO abandon\ufffd their children\r\neither because they are unable to\r\nsupport their children or because\r\nchildren interfere with their pro\r\nmiscuous lifestyles. Where the\r\nabandoned child turns out to be\r\nHIV-positive, the life prospect.\r\nfor such a child are bleak.\r\nHomes \ufffd\r\nDr Manguyu revealed that children\ufffds homes in Nairobi are now\r\ninsisting that abandoned children\r\nbrought in by police must be test\r\ned for HIV before they are placed\r\nat the homes.\r\nA follow-up of this information\r\nwith Dr Barnado\ufffds Homes con\r\nfirmed Dr Manguyu\ufffds statement.\r\nThe home routinely examines\r\nchildren medically for contagious  diseases (avoid infecting other children in the home, particularly\r\nthe delicate ones in the nursery.\r\nSuch children are normally treat\r\ned before they are taken into the\ufffd\r\nhome. But children With Aids are\r\nnot being taken in at all.\r\n\ufffdWe have no facilities to look\r\nafter Aids children,\ufffd the home\ufffds\r\nacting administrator, Mrs Lydia Nyalwal, told me.\r\nAnd even if Barnado would\r\nset aside special facilities for Aids\r\nchildren, wh\ufffd is prepared Lo look\r\nafter them?\r\n\ufffd \ufffdWe would Love to have those\r\nchildren, here, but our people are\r\nscared of Aids, and we are in a\r\ndilemma. I can see lots of problem coming, of Aids patients dying not because of the disease,\r\nbut because of rejection and lone\r\nliness,\ufffd Mrs Nyalwal says.\r\nMrs Nyalwal hinted that hers\r\nis not the only children\ufffds home\r\nthat is turning away HIV-positive babies.\r\nThe upshot of it is that police\r\nare literally Left with the baby in\r\ntheir arms, for hospitals too, have\r\nnot been keen to take in abandoned HIV-positive babies.\r\nThe Infectious Diseases Hospital (IDH), where such children\r\nhave been referred to plead no\r\nstaff to take care of HIV-positive\r\nbabies. There is the \ufffdvery real\r\ndanger that abandoned HIV-positive babies with nowhere to go\r\nmay soon become victims of infanticide. \ufffd\r\n\ufffdMy worry is that the number\r\n,of this kind of children is on the\r\nincrease,\ufffd Dr.  Manguyu, who is\r\nalso the secretary of the Kenya\r\nChapter of the African Network\r\non Prevention and Protection\r\nagainst Child Abuse and Neglect\r\n(ANPPCAN), says. \ufffd\r\nDr Elizabeth Ngugi, a lecturer\r\nat the College, of Health Sciences\ufffd Department of Community Health, of the University of\r\nNairobi,\ufffd emphasises the importance of breaking the transmission\r\nchain of Aids from father-to-mother-to-child. \r\n\ufffdAlthough health education\r\nmessages have been emphasizing\r\nihe use of condoms for the so-\ufffdcalled safer sex, Dr. Ngugi, who\r\nthree months ago earned a doctorate degree for her seven year\r\nwork with prostitutes, revealed\r\nthat condoms have not the magic\r\nbullet against the spread of Aids,\r\nfor a number of reasons.\r\nProstitutes who insist of using\r\ncondoms, she said, risk losing up\r\nto 80 per cent of their clients.\r\nSince moat of them resort to\r\nprostitution for commercial rea\r\nsons, they have to choose be\r\ntween one of the two evils\ufffd\ufffd to.\r\ncontinue with unprotected sex or\r\nto say no to 80 per cent of their\r\npotential partners, who will not\r\nuse condoms. ,\r\nBesides the male prostitutes\ufffd\r\n. refusal to use the condom, the\r\n\ufffddevice has ita inherent shortcoming.\r\nIt\ufffds poor record in family\r\nplanning programme, is well\r\nknow.\r\nPinholes \ufffd It\ufffds failure rate arise, from slip\r\noffs, from pinholes and from\r\nbreakage., among other disadvantages. \r\nDr Ngugi\ufffd. study testifies to this.\r\nFrom a 50 per cent infection rate among prostitutes\r\nin her area of study w 1984, the\r\ninfection rate has now shot up to\r\n90 per cent.\r\nThu., although Dr Ngugi\ufffds\r\nstudies found that zero-conversion among condom uses was\r\nthree times less compared to non-users, and although the condom\r\nslowed (but did not prevent) the\r\nprogression of Ads by 50 per\r\ncent, her final message\r\nemphasised the importance of\r\nstopping prostitution.\r\n\ufffdSPhere has to be a support \r\n facilitate the \ufffddecision to\ufffd\r\nstop prostitution. It I. vita) to in\r\ncrease the economic power of\r\nprostitutes who .want to quit\r\nprostitution, so that the reduction of their sex partners does\r\nnot result in the reduction of\r\ntheir economic power. You want\r\na support system that reduces\r\ntheir sex partners and maintains\r\nearning power,\ufffd Dr Ngugi\r\nSome delegates at the recent\r\nseminar expresse scepticism\r\nabout the extent to which econotnic clout could reduce depen\r\ndence of women on the so-called\r\n\ufffdAccident Profession\ufffd as a means\r\nof earning a living. \ufffd\r\nDr Ngugi adopted a mid-point\r\nview and said. \ufffdWe can never\r\nstop prostitution, but we can re\r\nduce it. The strongest reasons for\r\nprostitution are commercial, and\r\nif we can start with improving\r\nthe soda-economic welfare of the\r\nfamily, we can stop it.\ufffd .\r\nDr Gladys Martin, Unicef!\r\nESAR\ufffds PHC adviser, is strongly\r\nin favour of programmes to end\r\nprostitution.\r\n\ufffdI don\ufffdt\ufffd believe that prostitution is here to stay. If these women get gainful employment, then\r\nprostitution will stop,\ufffd she said.\r\nAlthough the cost of setting up\r\nsuch programmes was considered\r\nprohibitive, the delegates were\r\nunanimous that Aids itself is an\r\nexpensive disease and calls for \ufffd\r\nexpensive solutions.\r\nAccording to Dr Doris\r\nKinuthia,, a pediatric lecturer at\r\nthe College of Health Sciences\r\nthe impact of Aids in Africa is\r\nserious, as most of the effected\r\npersons are in their active and\r\nproductive years. , \ufffd\r\nTheir affliction with Aids, she\r\nsaid,\ufffd means a decrease in eco\r\nnomic output, serious demand a\r\non health services, and reversing\r\nthe gains in child survival\r\nprogrammes.\ufffd\r\nTwenty to 50 per cent of H1V\r\npositive mothers, she said, will\r\ngive birth to HIV positive babies,\r\nwith, decreased life expectancy,\r\nhe said. \ufffdWho will be willing to\r\nlook after the orphans left by\r\nAids affected parents?\ufffd she\ufffd\r\nasked.\r\nWe need to address ourselves\r\nto the tremendous social implications created by the Aids crisis,\r\nDr Kinuthia, who was the key\r\nnote speaker at the seminar says.\r\nDr Kinuthia effectively argued\r\nin favour of changing the title of\r\nthe seminar from Children, Victims of Aids, to: Children, relatives of Persons with Aids\r\n(PWA). Delegates to the recent seminar\r\nwere charged with the task of going back to their countries to establish the extent of the problem\r\nof children and relatives of PWAS. What are the psycho-social and economic implications involved in the issue? Which bodisa\ufffd will involve them in looking after orphans of Aids victims? What is to be the role of surviving relatives, communities, governments, religious bodies and non-governmental organisations?\r\nA follow-up regional seminar is\r\nplanned for mid-next year to re\r\nport on these and other findings,\r\nwhich should result in a report\r\ntentatively entitled: \ufffdRegional\r\nReport on Children in Families\r\nwith Aids.\ufffd\r\nSuche report, Dr Martin said,\r\ncould be used to advocate assistance for children in difficult circumstances created by the Aids\r\nsituation, for fund-raising in support of such programmes and for\r\ngeneral information.\r\nThe views expressed in\r\ncolumn are the author\ufffds and\r\ndo not necessarily reflect the\r\nNewspaper\ufffds standpoint.\r\nA lifetime suffering\r\nFor kins of Aids victims"}
