{"text": "DAILY NATION, THURSDAY OCTOBER 6, 1988\r\n\r\nAids cure continues to be elusive\r\n\r\nUnless scientists \ufffdstumble\ufffd\r\non a cure for Aids like in the\r\ncase of penicinin which\r\nopened a new era in the production of anti-bacteria medicines, the human immune deficiency virus HIV will to be a major killer and prevention must be continually emphasised.\r\nHowever, major attempts are\r\nbeing made to \ufffdtreat\ufffd the victims\r\nof Aids. In March last year, government authorities in the United States authorised the use of\r\nAZT (Azidothymidine) or zidovudine. which, in fact, was\r\ndeveloped in the 1960s.\r\nDr J. P. Horwitz, a researcher\r\nin Michigan. US is said to have\r\ndeveloped the drug to help in the\r\ntreatment of cancer but it proved\r\nineffective and was ignored until\r\nthe emergence of the Acquired\r\nImmune Deficiency syndrome\r\n, Researchers found out in 1984\r\nthat the drug tended to inhibit\r\nthe duplication of viruses including HIV in test tubes.\r\nMany countries are now using\r\nAZT to prolong the lives of the patients but its side effects\r\nin some cases may hasten the patients\ufffd death. However, some\r\nclinical researchers say that\r\nmuch depends on now AZT is\r\n\ufffdadministered\ufffd\r\nThe search for a vaccine or\r\nanti-Aids drug has resulted in the\r\nutilisation of molecular biology,\r\nbiotechnology and geneticengin\r\neering. The Aida virus is being\r\nsystematically dismantled into its\r\ntinies bits and if no progress \r\nin three years then the world\r\nmay as well forget \ufffdhigh tech\ufffd\r\nsearch for the \ufffdcure\ufffd or vaccine.\r\nIndication\r\nIndeed, the recent Third International conference on Aids in\r\nArusha, Tanzania attended by\r\namong others, Robert C. Gallo,\r\none of the discoverers of the Aids\r\nvirus, is an indication that the\r\nworld of Aids experts has sobered\r\nup after severa] years of making\r\nreckless statements about the\r\ndisease and Africans.\r\nit is definitely encouraging that\r\nother experts are beginning to listen to what our own experts say\r\nabout the disease, which is claiming the lives in an increasing\r\nnumber of people in many parts of the world.\r\nAs said in a previous article in\r\nthis column, the world was wait\r\nin to hear the details about the\r\nZairean anti-Aids drug MM1 said\r\nto have been discovered by Proffessor I Lurhuma of Zaire and\r\nDr A. Shafik of Egypt. Unfortunately, Prof Lurhurna was said to\r\nhave arrived late during the closing of Aids conference in Arusha.\r\nThe major criticism against\r\nMM1 is that its discoverers seem\r\nto evade thorough scrutiny from\r\nother experts, some of\ufffd whom\r\neven think MM1 may be fake.\r\nHowever, having directly or indirectly covered activities of lead\r\ning global Aids, researchers who\r\nended up \ufffdmisleading\ufffd the world\r\non various aspects of the virus\r\nand the disease, 1 strongly believe\r\nthe MMI team should be given s\r\nchance to sort out whatever problems they are facing.\r\nIndeed according to the abstract of the paper on MM1,\r\nwhich was to be presented in\r\nArusha, Aids patients who were\r\ngiven 20 injections of MM1 and\r\nthe usual drugs against opportunistic in infections gained energy,\r\nhad less diarrhoea and flingal infections.\r\nHowever, the most interesting\r\naspect was the improvement of\r\nhelper lymphocytes in 80 per cent\r\nof the cases.\r\nAccording to Prof Lurhuma\ufffds\r\npaper, these observations were\r\nmade within one year of administering the drug.\r\nThis year, aZairean professor\r\nof medicine, Dr Mbowa M.\r\nKalengayi, who had come from a\r\nmawr international Aids meeting\r\nin StockhoLm, Sweden, told me\r\nthat, he knew about the work of\r\nMM1 and it was definitely improving the health of the pa\r\ntienta. \ufffdit is going to be much\r\ncheaper and with no side effects.\ufffd\r\nEliminate\r\nThe Zairean medicine may not\r\ncure Aids and probably does not\r\neliminate the Aids virus as was\r\nalleged, but it may probably b.\r\none of the few drugs that seem to\r\nprolong the lives of the patients\r\nalthough there are doctors who\r\nremain very skeptical of\r\nLurhuma\ufffds findings and would be\r\nhappy to have his results verified\r\ny \ufffdindependent\ufffd researchers.\r\nThe World Health Organisation\ufffds\r\nAfrica regional office in Brazza\r\nville, Congo, has it willing to support further MMI research.\r\nAttempts to treat Aids are even\r\ncoming from China where there.\r\nhas been talk about mushrooms\r\nthat inhibit HIV multiplication.\r\nA mixture of 21 herbs to treat\r\nAids is also coming out of China\r\nwhere the disease LS still said to\r\nbe very minima].\r\nTheories about the origin of\r\nthe Aids virus seem to have\r\npatered out after attempts to\r\n\ufffdsmear\ufffd Africa with the virus\r\nfailed. However, an alternative\r\nhypothesis about HIV was in- \ufffd\r\nciudad among the papers presented in Arusha.\r\nA paper co-athoured by Dr\r\nGlen BrubakeT of Shfrati Hospital, Musoma in Tanzania, said\r\nAids is not new in the world and\r\nthat the HIV or Aids virus simply\r\nfourishes in already immune depressed patients, without causing\r\nthe syndrome.\r\nIn another instalment, we shall\r\nexamine attempts by two local\r\nherlalists to prolong the lives of\r\nAids victims.\r\nPatients will always try some\r\nthing that might help improve\r\ntheir situation and tins is noted\r\nin the US where there is a scramble for a compound dextransulphate from Japan considered\r\nuseless by medical authorities.\r\nBut their hope seems to lie in\r\nhigh-tech."}
