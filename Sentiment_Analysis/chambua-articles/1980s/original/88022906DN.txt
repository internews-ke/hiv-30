{"text": "MONDAY FEBRUARY 29 1988\r\n\r\nNew question mark over prevailing Aids theory\r\n\r\nA researcher who says federal\r\nexperts are wrong about the\r\ncause of Aids but are embarrassed to admit error will receive the first public airing of\r\nhis views this week before a\r\npresidential commission.\r\nDr Peter Duesberg, a respected\r\nvirus researcher at the University\r\nof California at Berkeley, will appear before the Presidential\r\nCommission on the HIV Epidemiology at a hearing on February 20 in\r\nNew York.\r\nIt will be the first time, he said,\r\nfor the Federal Government to\r\nacknowledge his suggestion that\r\nAcquired Immune Deficiency\r\nSyndrome may be caused by\r\nsomething other than the human\r\nimmunodeficiency virus.\r\nDuesberg said he angered col\r\nleagues at the National Institutes\r\nof Health when he questioned\r\ntheir conclusions about HIV in\r\nan article last March in the journal Cawer Research. And he\r\nsaid other researchers have declined publicly to debate the issue\r\nwith him.\r\n\ufffdHIV has become a billion-dollar virus and nobody wants to addmit that it might not be the one\r\ncausing Aids,\ufffd Duesbeg said in a\r\ntelephone interview. \ufffdThey don\ufffdt\r\nwant to admit error,\ufffd\r\nBut Dr Peter .1. Fiachinger, the\r\nhealth and human services co-ordinator of the federal war on\r\nAids, said the preponderance of\r\nthe evidence has convicted HJV\r\nas the Aids villain.\r\n\ufffdThe sum of the information is\r\nreally incontrovertible now.\ufffd\r\nFischinger said. \ufffdMany of the\r\nreputable scientists in this field\r\njust don\ufffdt want to go into a public\r\n\r\nBy PAUL RECE R\r\nWASHINGTON. Sunday\r\nforum and debate the issues because they don\ufffdt think there is\r\nanything to debate about.\ufffd\r\nTom Brandt, a spokesman for\r\nthe presidential commission, said\r\nDuesberg was invited to testify at\r\nthe New York hearings because\r\n\ufffdpeople have sent us material (on Duesberg), and one of our commissioners said we should hear\r\nthis guy.\ufffd The invitation, he said,\r\n\ufffdshould not be taken as an endorsement of his views\ufffd.\r\nDuesberg said other researchers shun him because so much now is at stake that nobody\r\nwants to question the HIV-Aids\r\nconnection. All of the government testing and research, he\r\nsaid, is centred on HIV \ufffdand no\r\nalternative views are tolerated\ufffd\r\nA virus researcher for 25 years,\r\nDuesberg said: \ufffdI feel embarrassed for my own field. We are\r\nnot giving this due scientific caution. I hate to see my field over claiming and then in five to 10\r\nyears people say \ufffdthose fools\r\ndidn\ufffdt see that it (HIV) had nothing to do with Aids.\ufffd\r\nFiachinger praised Duesberg for making \ufffdsignificant contributions\ufffd over the years in the study\r\nof oncogenes \ufffd genes that cause\r\ncancer growth.\r\nBut when Duesberg addressed\r\nAids. \ufffdhe ventured into a new\r\narea for him, which is the human\r\nimmune deficiency virus,\ufffd\r\nFischinger added. \ufffdMost scientists who have been working the\r\nfield did not take this (Duesberg\ufffds article) terribly seriously.\ufffd\r\nAmong the reasons that\r\nDuesberg questions that HIV\r\nmay cause Aids are:\r\nHIV has not been proved directly to cause Aids in laboratory\r\nanimals, as is routinely done for\r\nother viruses.\r\nIn reply, Fischinger said model has been found for\r\nAids. He said the only other \ufffd100\r\nper cent satisfactory\ufffd proof\r\nwould be to inject the purified\r\nHIV virus into an Aids-free\r\nhuman being and find out if that\r\nperson develops the disease.\r\n\ufffdWhen you have a\r\nhuman disease and there are no\r\nperfect animal models that get\r\nthe disease you will never answer\r\nthat question in an unambiguous\r\nway,\ufffd Fiachinger said. \ufffdNobody is\r\ngoing to do that kind of an\r\nexperiment.\ufffd\r\nDuesberg said HIV kills the\r\nT4 immunity cell at a rate too\r\nslow to cause Aids because the\r\ncells can easily be replaced daily\r\nby the body.\r\nIn reply, Fischinger said HIV is\r\n\ufffdnot like the retroviruses that Dr Duesberg is familiar with that go\r\nlike gangbusters and are very rap\r\nidly infective.\ufffd\r\nInstead, he said. HIV slowly\r\nexhausts the body\ufffds ability to replenish the T4 cells that are\r\nkilled. When this happens, the\r\nbody loses major protection\r\nagainst disease.\r\nDuesberg said Aids screen in\r\nsearches for antibodies and that the presence of these antibodies proves that the body can protect itself from the HIV virus. .\r\nNot so, said Fiachinger. H said many viral diseases, such a smallpox, produce antibodies, the virus still wins.\r\n\ufffdWhen there was smallpoxaround, people died quite regulaly with a lot of antibodies,\ufffd\r\nsaid.\r\nDuesberg said that if the HIV virus did cause Aids, then tested positive for the\r\nshould be developing Aids\r\nknown rate. He said there h\r\nbeen no indication of this.\r\nIn reply, Fiachinger said the incidence of Aids is accurate\r\ntracking the mathematic forecasts.\r\n\ufffdOur predictions are, unfortunately, right,\ufffd Fiachinger said.\r\nAids is an incurable disease\r\nthat compromises the body\ufffds immune system by killing disease\r\nfighting cells called T4 lymphcytes. Without these cells, the body becomes susceptible to infection.\r\nThe disease usually is spread through sexual contact\r\nthrough an exchange of blood such as the sharing of intravenous drug needles.\r\nAs of February 1, Aids has been diagnosed in 52,256 Americans, of whom more than half, of\r\n29,206, have died since 1981, according to the Federal centre for Disease Control. Nobody has\r\nbeen known to recover from Aids.\r\n(AP)"}
