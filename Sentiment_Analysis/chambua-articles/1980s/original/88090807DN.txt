{"text": "Thursday September 8, 1988\r\nTHE RISK TO MEDICAL STAFF\r\n\r\nResearch on the Acquired immune Deficiency Syndrome (Aids) shows that the malady is transmitted from one human body to another through body fluids and secretions like blood\r\narid semen.\r\nThis fact explains clearly how largely advantaged the virus (HIV) is to invade any individual ranging from the Haitians (body gamblers) to innocent anaemic patients who need prompt blood transfusion and the health workers who handle Aids victims and their specimens without proper protection.\r\nWith this in mind it\ufffds unfortunate that although the machinery geared to controlling the spread\r\nof this dreadful ailment has one) job on the question of promiscuity, it has done\r\nrelatively little in other spheres, the fate of a nurse or any other\r\nmedical staff who may accidentally. handle blood or other body\r\nsecretions contaminated with the HIV.\r\nWhile the Ministry of Health in conjunction with WHO through our mass media is\r\npreaching the philosophy of shunning promiscuity and instead\r\nadopting zero grazing, what does it have for the people like the prostitutes,\r\nhave equally high chances of contracting this syndrome out of professional exposures?"}
