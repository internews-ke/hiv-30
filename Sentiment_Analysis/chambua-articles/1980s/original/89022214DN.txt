{"text": "Nation Wednesday February 22 1989\r\nHOLLAND'S LATEST AIDS CAMPAIGN TARGETS TEENS\r\nPolicy is not to scare people.\r\n\r\nBy a Correspondent\r\nInformation on Aids is wide\r\nspread in the Netherlands, so it is\r\nalmost impossible for most young\r\npeople to be ignorant of the basic\r\nfacts. Leaflets are available in\r\npost offices and libraries, at local\r\nhealth centers and at the many\r\norganisations ,that deal with homosexuality, drug addiction, and\r\nguidance on health and, sexuality.\r\nMasa media regularly address\r\nthe problem, especially during a\r\nnational campaign, and people\r\nwho really want all the details\r\ncan telephone one, of the national\r\nor local mforznaton lines. At the end of 1988 there were\r\njust over 600 registered Aids patients, largely homosexuals, drug\r\nusers or a combination of both.\r\nThe number of people with HIV\r\nis estimated at between 15000\r\nand 30,000. These figures compare with countries like;\r\nFrance and West Germany:\r\nthat is no reason for complacencey. With 37 cases per one million\r\ninhabitants the Netherlands is\r\nstill well up in the top 10 of\ufffd\r\nEurope as far as prevaIence is concerned.\r\n\ufffdWe realise that Aids is a national issue, so we have a mesage for everybody,\ufffd says Bert.\r\nEijrond of the NCAB, (the National Committee on Aids).\r\nSince its formation in 1978, the\r\nCommittee has initiated a \r\nnational campaigns, and coordinated and supported initiatives by several organisations like\r\n\ufffdOur aim is two fold,\ufffd Eijrond\r\nexplains. \ufffdIn the fI\ufffdt place we\r\nwant to stop the spread of HIV,\r\nthe virus that causes Aids. In the\r\nsecond place we want to control\r\nthe reactions of society. We are\r\ntrying to emphasize that Ad is\r\nnot some scary disease, causad by\r\nhomosexuals and drug adiction.\r\nThere is nothing to be afraid of,\r\nas long as people know what they\r\nare doing.  The first national campaign, in\r\n1987, was meant to inform the\r\npublic in a matter-of-fact way,\r\nmainly trying to avoid such kinds of\r\nPrejudiced reactions. The second campaign, launched April\r\n1988, was particularly at\r\nthose who come into contact with blood in the course of their work.\r\nApart from these nationwide\r\ncampaigns the NCAB has aimed\r\npublicity at particular groups\r\nthought at risk, such as intravenous drug users, homosexuals,\r\nand hemophiliacs.\r\nIn accordance with the wishes\r\nof the Dutch parliament, a third\r\nnational campaign has been \r\nsince the end of last October, this time directed at \r\npeople, their parents and their teachers.\r\nSo far extremely few young\r\npeople have been found to be in\r\ntected. But a campaign advising a\r\nchange in sexual behavior is\r\nBy making use of the\r\nmass media and the schools, he\r\nsays the NCAB can reach all\r\nyoung people,\ufffd including those\r\nwho may put themselves at risk\r\nthrough their behavior the\r\nfuture.\r\nFour choices\r\n\ufffdAs in .U the other campaigns,\r\nour policy is, to inform people\r\nwithout scaring them and with\r\nout forcing upon them all kinds\r\nof moral judgments. We don\ufffdt\r\nwant young people to become\r\n\ufffdaverse to sex or to blame homosexuals. What we offer them are four choices. You can have no sex\r\nyou can have sex with a\r\nPermanent partner you are sure\r\nof, you can use a condom or you\r\ncan employ other ways of making\r\nlose. We don\ufffdt make a choice.\r\nup to them,\ufffd he says.\r\nThe message is brought home\r\nmany ways, varying from leaf, lets and television commercials to\r\n\ufffd special projects for adolescents\r\nand a series of three television\r\nprogrammes by Dutch Educational Television.\r\nThe Rutgers stitching is one of\r\nthe peoples involved in the\r\nit. As a Centre for family\r\nmatters concerning\r\nSexuality, the FPA has built up\r\nmuch expertise in the field of the\r\nsexual education of adolescence\r\nEven before the start o\r\nNational Committee, information on Aids had been integrated\r\ninto sexual education programmes for young people.\r\n\ufffdIntegration has always been\r\nour starting point,\ufffd emphasizes in charge of the\r\nprevention and guidance policy.\r\n\ufffdEspecially among young."}
