{"text": "STOCKHOLM, Sunday\r\nMONDAY JUNE 13 1988\r\nMAJOR AIDS MEETING OPENS\r\n\r\nMore than 6,000 experts from at\r\nleast 120 countries gathered here\r\ntoday for the world\ufffds biggest Aids\r\nconference to discuss progress in\r\ntesting for and treating the disease.\r\nThe fourth international conference on Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (Aids), a five-day event organised by the World\r\nHealth Organisation, is probably\r\nthe biggest gathering of scientific\r\nmaterial ever made, organizer say.\r\nDoctors said most of the \r\nnews to be presented at the\r\nAids meeting\r\nconference would concentrate on\r\n\ufffdside-issues\ufffd \ufffd new test methods\r\nor medicines which slow the\r\nprogress of the disease \ufffd rather\r\nthan on any cure or preventive\r\nvaccine.\r\n\ufffdWe will hardly be presenting a\r\nvaccine. All research trials have\r\nso far been either neutral or negative. But it would be strange if we\r\ndid not answer in the long\r\nrun,\ufffd said leading Stockholm researcher Hans WigzelL\r\nMore than 3,600 papers are being presented scientists any\r\nwhere will have access to conference information via a computer\r\ndatabase .\r\nOrganisers have also provided\r\na forum for the social, educational and political aspects of the\r\ndisease.\r\n\ufffdThe non-scientific aspects of\r\nAide deserve equal attention, especially since there still seems\r\nlittle prospect at the moment of finding a cure,\ufffd one organizer said\r\nAids kills by breaking down he\r\nbody\ufffds natural defences. It is usually transmitted by sexual or\r\nblood contact, and the highest-risk groups are homosexuals\r\nand intravenous drug users who\r\nshare dirty needles.\r\nBut experts are expected to open\r\nhow the disease is spreading through the heterosexual\r\npopulation.\r\nEven before the conference\r\nstarted, doctors were inundating\r\nabout 1,000 journalists with news\r\nof research finding, and new forms of treatment.\r\nLeading French researcher\r\nDaniel Zagury told a pre-conference forum that the first trials of\r\nan Aids vaccine on humans was\r\nprocessing in Zaire, and that the\r\nproject would be extended to at\r\nleast 200 people within a year.\r\nAL present, 45 humans were be\r\ning tested with the vaccine, which\r\nhad succeeded in promoting the\r\ndevelopment of antibodies\r\nagainst HIV, the virus which is\r\nthe cause of Aids.\r\nThe tests will now be extended\r\noutside Zaire, probably to France.\r\nMeanwhile, the Aids virus has\r\nbeen detected in 8.9 per cent of\r\nthe 5,400 .children at the Sao\r\nPaulo Foundation for the Welfare\r\nof Minors, (FEBEM), the institution announced yesterday.\r\nFebem president Wayta\r\nMenezes Dalla Pria said the\r\nsituationu was \ufffdworrisoni\ufffd and\r\nthe institution was considering\r\nopening Within SIX months clinice\r\nto deal with the epidemic.\r\n(Agencies) .\r\nMajor"}
