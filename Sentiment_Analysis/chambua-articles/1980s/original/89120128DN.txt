{"text": "Friday December 1, 1989\r\nA real menace\r\n\r\nThere may be still be some people\r\nwho assume or believe that Aids\r\nis not a disease that exists and\r\neven if it exists, it does not kill\r\nanybody and it is not a serious\r\nproblem.\r\nStill there may be some, for example in Nyanza, who believe it\r\nis not a new disease and is\r\nChira while others from \ufffd\r\nparts of the country still assume\r\nit is a manifestation of various\r\nancient diseases which just kill a few.\r\nAids is not an \ufffdold\ufffd disease.\r\nThere is no community that can\r\nboast of having dealt with it for\r\neven a aecade. It is a deadly new\r\ninfection-first noted by American\r\nmedical scientists in mid 1981.\r\nThe disease is proven to be\r\ncaused by a lethal virus now\r\ncalled the Human immune- defiency Virus (HIV) which has\r\nalready resulted in over 6,000\r\npeople in our country developing\r\nFull blown aids, a condition in\r\nwhich the person may end up dying because body\ufffds defense system has been destroyed and it\r\ncannot fight against all sorts of\r\ndiseases including cancers. \r\nThe diseases weakened by the\r\nAids virus are called opportunistic infections.\r\nUnder normal circumstances\r\nsuch diseases are not lift threatening but they can be lethal in\r\nAids cases.\r\nAids refers to the last, usually\r\nfats], stages of infection by the\r\nhuman immuno-deficiency virus.\r\nMedical scientists have now\r\nclassified the HIV as belonging to\r\na group of viruses called\r\nretroviruses.\r\nViruses are the smallest of the\r\ninvisible things that can cause\r\ndiseases.\r\nThey are generally just corn\r\nposed of genes sorrounded by a\r\nprotein envelope.\r\nThe genes or genetic material\r\nis either deoxyribonucleic acid\r\n(DNA) or ribonucleic acid\r\n(RNA). .\r\nRetroviruses like the MIV have menace\r\nKeep to YOUR PARTNER \r\nA poster that tells it all.\r\ngenetic material of lie dormant or quiet for years in ribonucleic acid (RNA)  side the cells and could at a later\r\nHowever, before the Aide virus date order the cell to Produce\r\nInserts its gene into T helper cells more HIV which could be easily\r\nit uses an enzyme called reverse spread to others through \r\nconverting  the RNA Thus one could easily start a\r\ninto DNA.  disaster which may cause the\r\nThus the Aids virus also en- death of thousands if people\r\nsures its surviv.al and replication don\ufffdt stick to their partners and\r\nby inserting their genetic material avoid high risk behavior.\r\nal into the genetic material of the The Aids virus attacks the\r\nhost cell which in turn is ordered most important component of\r\nby the inserted gene to produce our body\ufffds defence system.\r\nmore viruses.  \ufffdt attaches itselt to a structure\r\nOnce the gene of the Aids virus or molecule called CD4 on the\r\nenters the boit cell it is still prac\ufffd surface of helper T cell (or T4\r\ntically impossible to deal with it cell).\r\nwithout damaging the host cells Helper T cells is charged with\r\ninvolved and this is one reason the duty of directing the war be\ufffd\r\nwhy this virus poses  major tween our defence system and\r\nthreat 10 flkifld disease causing organisms like\r\nEven if the virus is eliminated bacteria, parasites, fungus, and\r\nfrom blood stream its genes may viruses."}
