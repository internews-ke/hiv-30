Jean.\r\nBaptist Brunet of the French\r\nHealth Ministry told reporters.\r\nBecause Aids has a lag time of\r\none to three years between onset\r\nand diagnosis, health experts\r\nbelieve that the ailment is at the\r\nsame stage in Europe that was\r\nin the United States two years\r\nag0.\r\n\ufffdIn the absence of control\r\nMeasures  yet to he discovered, we\r\ncould have an outbreak equal in\r\nsize to the United States,\ufffd Dr\r\nPeter Ehijesen of Denmnark\ufffds\r\nInstitute of Cancer Research\r\nwrote recently in the British\r\nMedical Journal\r\nThe European experience has mimicked the early American\r\nexperience: there has been a considerable\r\nbut not yet explosive\r\nincrease in cases of Aids in Europe,\ufffd he said.\r\nAids, Acquired Immune\r\nDeficiency Syndrome, was first\r\ndiagnosed in 1981 after an alarming outbreak of unexplained\r\nsickness among homosexual men in New York, San Francisco and\r\nLos Angeles.\r\nThe disease breaks down the\r\nbody\ufffds natural immune system making its victims vulnerable to\r\nalmost any infection that comes\r\nalong. It an also cause a rare\r\nform of skirt cancer known as\r\nKaposi  Sarcoma. Its cause remains a mystery, although a virus is universally suspected,\r\nand there is no known cure.\r\nAs of November 21, the Centre\r\nfor Disease Control in Atlanta\r\nhad registered 2,803 cases of Aids\r\nin United States since 1979,\r\nincluding 1.146 deaths\ufffda fatality\r\nrate of 41 per cent.\r\nThe highest risk groups are\r\nmale homosexuals, 71 per cent 11 all cases; intravenous drug abusers 17 per cent: Haitians, 5\r\nper cent; and hemophiliacs, less\r\nthan 1 per cent.\r\n\ufffdEuropean investigators have\r\nreported that the same groups are\r\nat risk.\ufffd Dr Ebbesen,  a leading\r\nAids researcher wrote recently.\r\n\ufffdIn Europe, however, the relatively large populations of\r\nAfricans from the Upper Congo\r\nBasin, and visitors pi that area may have allowed recognition of yet another population t hat appears at high risk.\r\n\ufffdA condition such as Aids could have long existed unrecognised in t he African setting and gained entrance into ,the Americas and Europe in recent years  through increases in inter-continental travel.\ufffd\r\nIn the first co-ordinated attempt to assess the global\r\nImpact of the disease, 38 scientists involved in Aids research got together last month at (he head quarters of the World Health Organisation in Geneva, Switzerland.\r\nThey reported that there have\r\nbeen 2137 confirmed cases no Aids\r\nin  Europe since1979 including\r\n164 cases, or 60 per cent of the\r\ntotal, which were diagnosed\r\nbetween January amid October of\r\nthis year.
