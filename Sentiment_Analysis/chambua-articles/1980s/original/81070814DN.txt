{"text": "WEDNESDAY JULY 8 1981\r\n\r\nHomos prone to rare cancer\r\n\r\nDOCTORS in New York and\r\nCalifornia have diagnosed among\r\nHomosexual men 41 cases of a\r\nrare and often rapidly fatal form\r\nof cancer.\r\nDoctors who found 20 cases of\r\nKaposi\ufffds\ufffd Sarcoma in New York\r\nand six cases in California are\r\nalerting other physicians who\r\ntreat large numbers of homosexual men to help identify more\r\nCases and to shorten the delay in offering chemotherapy.\r\nEight of the victims died less\r\nthan two years after the diagnosis\r\nwas made. .\r\nThere is no national registry of\r\ncancer victims in the United\r\nStates. The nationwide incidence\r\nof Kaposi\ufffds sarcoma in the past\r\nhad been estimated by the\r\nnational centres for disease\r\ncontrol to be less than six one-\r\nhundredths of a case per 100,000\r\npeople annually, or about two\r\ncases in every 3 million people,\r\naccording to a spokesman, Dr. James Curran.\r\nIn the US it primarily has\r\naffected men older than 50 years.\r\nBut in recent months, donors at\r\nnine medical cent res in New York\r\nand seven hospitals in California\r\nhave been diagnosing the cases\r\namong younger men, all  of whom\r\nsaid during diagnostic interviews\r\nthat they were homosexual.\r\nMany of the patients also have\r\nbeen treated viral infections\r\nsuch as herpes cytomegalovirus\r\nand hepatitis B. as well as\r\nparasitic infections such as\r\namoebiais and giardiasis Many\r\npatients also reported that they\r\nhad used drugs such as amyltnitriternd (LSI) to heighten\r\nsexual pleasure.\r\nDr. Curran said there was no apparent danger to non- homosexuals from contagion."}
