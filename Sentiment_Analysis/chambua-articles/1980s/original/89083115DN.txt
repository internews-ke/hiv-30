{"text": "NATION THURSDAY AUGUST 31, 1989\r\n\r\nNEW BUT COSTLY HOPE FOR AIDS PATIENTS\r\n\r\nBy IRWIN ARIEFF\r\nRecent medical break\r\nhroughs promise a better\r\nger life for people with\r\nbut threaten to break\r\nback of US government\r\nhealth programmes for the\r\npoor and disabled.\r\nFor the first time in the\r\nshort history of Aids, which\r\nbecame known to medical\r\nscience less than a decade\r\nago, a treatment is available\r\nthat has been shown to block\r\nthe progression of the disease\r\nat every stage\r\nBut the treatments the\r\nanti-Aids drug AZT, is very\r\nexpensive.\r\nThough the price could\r\ncome down in the future, Aids\r\npatients are now paying\r\n$7,000 to $8,000 a year for the\r\ndrug, which is made by London-based Wellcome PLC.\r\nAs a result of recent research findings, more and\r\nmore people will soon be taking AZT.\r\nBut along with its promise\r\nof longer survival and an improved quality of life, the de\r\nvelopment will further strain\r\na health care budget that is\r\nalready at the breaking point.\r\nWhile some infected individuals are well-to-do, the\r\nfastest growing category of\r\nAids patients is drug addicts\r\nand their spouses and children \ufffd individuals who typically have few resources and\r\nlittle hope of improving their lot in life.\r\nThe promise \ufffd and the problem \ufffd arise from a recent study\r\ndetails of which were made public\r\nearlier this month, that found\r\nAZT prolonged the lives of infect\r\ned individuals even before they\r\nbegan to experience Aids\r\nsymptoms.\r\nA second study, announced two\r\nweeks earlier, found the drug\r\nhelped people with early symptoms of Acquired Immune be -\r\nciency Syndrome, a virus that destroys the body\ufffds immune system.\r\nAZT was first found effective.\r\nagainst the Aids virus In a 1986\r\nstudy that involved only seriously ill patients.\r\nFor the past two years, the\r\ndrug has been given primarily to\r\npeople with advanced symptoms,\r\nof the disease while tests were\r\nconducted on its effects on other\r\ncategories of Aids patients.\r\nWelcome officials estimate\r\nthat as few as 20,000 people\r\nworldwide are currently taking.\r\nBut the two recent studies\r\ngreatly expand the number of\r\npeople who stand to benefit from\r\nit disabled, small children and others who are similarly needy.\r\nBut the government spends only about one billion dollars a year treating Aids patient\r\nthrough the Medicare and state\r\noperated Medicaid subsidies programmes.\r\nAnd rather than expand\r\nprogramme, the administration\r\nasking Congress to cut Medical spending by $2.3 billion for the coming fiscal year which begin October 1."}
