{"text": "Nation Friday February 5, 1988 \r\nUNCIRCUMSCISED MALES MORE PRONE TO AIDS\r\n\r\nUncircumcised people and those with genital ulcers who sleep with prostitutes and other high-risk partners stand a higher chance of getting Aids.\r\nA study conducted on prostitutes at Pumwani area in Nairobi and\r\ntheir clients who catch venereal\r\ndiseases including genital ulcers,\r\nindicate that uncircumcised\r\nmales are more susceptible to the\r\nhuman immune deficiency virus\r\n(HIV) that causes the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome\r\nDr William Cameron, a Canadian researcher associated with the\r\nuniversity of Nairobi, said Dr Cameron said sexual transmission of the Aids virus increased in the presence of other\r\nvenereal diseases especially\r\nthose resulting in ulcers like\r\nthose caused by a macro-Organism called heamophillus ducreyi.\r\nHe said diseases like to HIV\r\ninfection tended to be mild and\r\noften silent or subclinical.\r\n\ufffdMass control of sexually-transmitted diseases, especially\r\nthe genital ulcer disease, may reduce the spread of the Aids\r\nvirus.\ufffd\r\nForeskin\r\nThree other researchers told the Nation that the presence of\r\nthe foreskin in uncircumcised\r\nmen with genital ulcers probably\r\nincreases the surface area avail\r\nable for infection, but warned\r\nthat people should not rush to\r\nprostitutas or other high risk\r\ngroups just because they are circumcised. They may still catch\r\nAids.\r\nThe afternoon session on sexually transmitted diseases attracted a record crowd who filled all\r\nthe available space in Kemri conference hail.\r\nAnother speaker said there was\r\nneed for continuous education on\r\naids.\r\nPresenting findings of a survey\r\ncarried out in Nyeri District on\r\nhow much people know of the\r\ndisease, Mrs Anne M. Pertet of\r\nKemri said that when her team\r\ncamed out the survey last October and November, 90 per cent of\r\nthe respondents said they had\r\nheard of Aids but a number of\r\nthem thought it was no longer a\r\nproblem since it was no longer\r\npublicised.\r\nThe survey found that 41.5 per\r\ncent of the people aged between\r\n60 and 78 had not heard of Aids.\r\nThe researchers found that\r\npeople in the district were aware\r\nthat Aids was transmitted\r\nthrough sexual intercourse, but\r\nthey also were under the misconception that it could be spread\r\nthrough hand-shakes, sharing the\r\nsame room utensils, clothing and\r\nother facilities. Six of the 915 respondents even thought one\r\ncould catch Aids from the air.\r\nAmong the population that was\r\nsurveyed, blood contact, contaminate needles and homosexuality\r\nwere not known as major methods of transmission.\r\nThe people who thought the population can contract Aids\r\nthrough sharing the same room,\r\nutensils and other facilities did\r\nnot see how it could be prevented.\r\nThe researchers therefore recommended a massive education\r\ncampaign on Aids prevention.\r\nAsked who was most likely to\r\nget Aids, 51.4 per cent of the\r\npeople said prostitutes, 8.6 per\r\ncent said single men and women.\r\nper cent said promiscuous men\r\nand women, 6 per cent thought\r\nmen were at greater risk. 4.9 per\r\ncent said town dwellers, while 3.6\r\nper cent said everybody was at risk. The rest of the respondents\r\ngave other answers including homosexuals, drunkards, tourists,\r\nhospital staff, while 10.1 per cent\r\ndid not know.\r\nLimiting sexual activity to one partner was the answer given by\r\nmost. people interviewed in this\r\nsurvey when asked how best the\r\nthought Aids could be controlled,\r\nbut a staggering 28.4 per cent did\r\nnot know what can be done to\r\ncontrol Aids.\r\nThe survey showed that most\r\npeople had heard about Aids either from other people or from\r\nthe radio. They preferred to\r\nthe information through chamas and barazas as they felt this we ,\r\nmost people would get to know\r\nabout Aids.\r\nIn another presentation, Dr P. Datta of the University of\r\nNairobi said mothers whose infants failed to thrive within the\r\nfirst nine months of life could be\r\nhaving the human immunodeficiency (HIV). .\r\nDr Datta was presenting a paper on \ufffdHIV prenatal exposure\r\neffect on infant growth\ufffd.\r\nIn their study, Dr Datte and\r\nothers found that prenatal exposure to maternal HIV infection\r\ndid not affect the birth weight of\r\ninfants nor their gestational .\r\nHowever, within nine months ,\r\nthe study showed that infants of\r\nHIV-infected mothers lagged behind in weight as compared to\r\nthose whose mothers were not infected with HIV.\r\nPre-natal HIV is the Aids-causing\r\nAnother researcher said up to\r\n75 per cent of the strains of bacteria which cause gonorrhea are\r\nresistant to penicillin.\r\nTherefore, there is an urgent\r\nneed to find cheaper and accept\r\nable alternate drugs for the\r\nteatment of pencillin-resistant\r\ngonorrhea, Professor Wamola of\r\nthe University of Nairobi said.\r\nHe was presenting findings on\r\na tria) which compared the effectiveness of two alternate drugs\r\nwhich are used to treat pencillin\r\nresistant gonorrhea.\r\nThe two drugs, norfioxacin and\r\nspectionomycin, both showed to\r\nbe at least 90 per cent effective in\r\nsingle doses, for the treatment of\r\npenicillin-resistant gonorrhea.\r\nIn a contribution from the\r\nfloor, Mr E. Itotia of Upjohn\r\ncompany, a drug manufacturing\r\nfirm, said that spectionomycin\r\nwas not a new drug as it had been\r\nin use for 18 years, and its a price .\r\nin Sh43 a dose and not Sh170 as\r\nclaimed in some quarters.\r\nHe said spectionomycin was\r\ntherefore not expensive\r\nmales \ufffdmore\r\nprone to Aids\ufffd"}
