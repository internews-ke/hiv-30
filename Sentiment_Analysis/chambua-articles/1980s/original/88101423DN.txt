{"text": "FRIDAY OCTOBER 14, 1988\r\nNATURE OF THE AIDS VIRUS AND ITS FATAL DEVELOPMENT\r\n\r\nAlthough the first case of\r\nAids was recognised in the\r\nUnited States in 1981, the virus that causes the condition\r\nwas identified in 1983 at the\r\nInstitute Pasteur in Paris. It\r\nwas first named according to\r\none of its presentations \ufffd enlargement of the lymph nodes.\r\nIt was therefore initially named\r\n. Lymphadenopathy Associated\r\nVirus (LAV). But confirmation\r\nthat the virus was indeed the actual cause of Aids came much later in 1984, this time from the\r\nNational Cancer Institute, Unit\r\ned States. That time there was\r\nmore accurate information that\r\nthe virus acted by attacking one\r\nof the blood cells involved in the\r\ndefense of the body called\r\nHuman T-Lymphocytes.\r\nvirus was consequently re\r\nnamed to reflect what it actually\r\ndid and was called\r\nHuman T-Lymph phatic Virus\r\nIn 1986 an international expert committee renamed it Human Immuno Deficiency Virus. (HIV) which is now its current name.\r\nRecently, a new virus has been identified in West Africa. This virus, which i related to the original HIV and acts in a similar way, with \ufffdroutes of transmission, has been identified in other parts of the world. The first virus is now \r\nOnce HIV-1 (and HIV-2) are\r\nintroduced into the human body,\r\nthey attach themselves to specific\r\ncells in the human body that are\r\nconcerned with body immune de\r\nfence system. These specific cells\r\nto which the virus attaches itself\r\nare called the Helper-T Lymphocytea. Although these . Helper-T\r\nLymphocytes are the favountes,\r\nthe virus can also attach itself to\r\n\ufffdother defense cells known as the\r\nmacrophages.\r\nThere  also some evidence\r\nthat other cells in the human\r\nbody can support the growth of\r\nMIV, such as those cells lining\r\nthe wall of the intestines (bowel\r\nepitheLium) and in the brain\r\nmicroglial cells).\r\n. But for practical purposes the\r\nmain target of attack are the\r\nHelper-T Lymphocytes. A Lot is\r\nknown about what happens when\r\nHIV makes contact with the\r\nHelper-T Lymphocytes. The HIV\r\nsheds its outer coat (which is made of fat material) and then\r\nits contents into the body\r\nThese contents consist of a central core up of a certain substance called RNA (short\r\nform for Ribo-nucleic Acid). This MW RNA consists of only a single strand of chemical substances. Once in the human body cell this single strand replicates itself resulting in a double-strand.\r\nThis double strand is now\r\nknown as DNA (short for Dioxyribonucleic Acid). This HIV\r\nDNA now Inserts itself into the\r\nhuman cell DNA. DNA is that\r\npart of the body cell that the genes. In other words the\r\nHIV now becomes part of the\r\nhuman cells genetic material The\r\ninfection  becomes irreversible.\r\nAt this point we may pose to\r\nponder why in fact it is not easy\r\nto develop a drug that will cure\r\nAids. You will notice that the\r\nHIV goes directly to fuse with the\r\nhuman cell DNA that they be\r\ncome one and the same thing.\r\nThis means that any medicine\r\nused in the treatment of Aids\r\nmust be able to penetrate the human DNA, disentangle the fusion, kill the 111V and get out of the human cell, all this without injuring the human DNA, and\r\nleaving the whole cell intact.\r\nThe technology to work on the\r\nDNA, is not available today, leave alone a medicine, that will\r\nbe able to disentangle, the MIV DNA from the human DNA.\r\nModestly put, there Is no prospect of cure in the sense of eliminating the integrated viral DNA\r\nbecause to attempt to do so would be to kill the infected human cell\r\nTherefore the only prospect of a drug is one that will suppress\r\nthe activity of the virus rather\r\nthan isolating and killing the virus. Such a drug would not be a\r\ncure but merely a way of holding\r\nout much longer by keeping an\r\ninfected person relatively healthy\r\nbut not cured.\r\nOnce the virus invades the\r\nhuman cell and the viral DNA\r\nintegrates with that of the human cell it may remain dormant for months, or even years. But if the\r\ninfected cells are activated by the body\ufffds immune system, for example when they have to fight an\r\nother disease, the MIV will become reproduce itself within the infected cell, making copies that\r\nwill go on to infect more human cells.\r\nThis process may also start\r\nwithout necessarily being triggered off by another disease.\r\nHowever, once the process of reproduction is set off, the viral\r\nDNA starts to instruct-the human cell to produce HIV component, which assemble on the surface of the human cell and, by a complicated process called bud ding, of new viruses."}
