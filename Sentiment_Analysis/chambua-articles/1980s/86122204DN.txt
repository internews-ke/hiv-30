{"text": "December 22 1986\r\n\r\nAIDS not common in Kenya, says doctor\r\n\r\nThe Western Provincial Medical Officer of Health, Dr\r\nM. O. Ogondo, has said Aids\r\nis still comparatively uncommon in Kenya, although the\r\nnumber of patients has been increasing every year.\r\nDr Ogondo, who was adressing\r\na seminar organised by the Kenya\r\nMedical association, Kakemega\r\nDivision at the Kakamega Golf Hotel at the weekend, asked\r\nthe press not to cause undue\r\npanic with statements \ufffdnot\r\nauthenticated by statistic.\r\nHe said the prevalence of the\r\nAcquired Immune Deficiency\r\nSyndrome in Kenya was still\r\nuncertain, and that the Coast,\r\nNairobi and Western Kenya\r\nwere the areas with the highest\r\nincident of the disease.\r\nA few cases had been suspected\r\nat Kakamega Provincial General\r\nHospital, he said. On cease had\r\nbeen positive to the \ufffdElisa Test,\ufffd\r\nthe most commonly used in\r\nKenya to identify Aids. \r\nDr Ogondo said the disease was\r\nfirst identified in 1981 and is\r\ncaused by a previously unknown,\r\nretrovirus known as human\r\nimmunodeficiency virus (HIV).\r\nAids, he said, was only part of a\r\n. spectrum of diseases caused by\r\nHIV and between five and 20 per\r\ncent of people infected with it\r\nappeared to progress to Aids. \ufffd\r\nHowever, he said, as with any\r\nUncommon disease, the process of diagnosis was difficult. He called\r\nupon the doctors to be suspicious\r\nif a patient was a member of the\r\nhigh\ufffd risk groups, namely\r\n-homosexuals, promiscuous men\r\nand women including prostitutes,\r\nbisexual men, haempohiliacs\r\nand other recipients of blood and Intravenous drug users\r\nIUDs. \ufffd He said the World Health Organisation recently suggested some ,many and minor criteria to\r\nHelp clinicians to whom sophisticated laboratory and viral culture facilities were not available Dr. Ogondo told them to exercise extreme caution in declaring a patient an Aids victim. He said there was no drug, yet that could cure Aids. \r\nJudges to rule out\r\nEx-mayors? "}
