{"text": "May 8 1987\r\nNew AIDS virus may cause epidemic - Experts\r\n\r\nA cousin of the Aids virus found\r\nin West Africa causes a disease\r\nindistinguishable from Aids and\r\nmay spread to ignite a new Aids\r\nepidemic, French researchers.\r\nThe virus called HIV 2 was\r\ndiscovered in 1984. It is distinct from HIV-1\r\n, which causes Aids in\r\nthe United States, Europe,\r\nCentral Africa and other parts of\r\nthe world. .\r\n\ufffdIt seems to be localised at the\r\nmoment\ufffd In West Africa, said Dr\r\nFrancois Clavel of the Pasteur\r\n\ufffdInstitute. \ufffdWhy there is no reason\r\nwhy this epidemic would not\r\nspread over Africa or Europe or\r\nother countries like HIV-1 did,\r\nunless we are very vigilant and\r\ncan detect carriers \r\nEarlier, researchers from the\r\nPasteur Institute in Paris, reported HIV 2 in two Aids\r\npatients.  Clavel said the latest\r\nstudy, documenting HIV-2\r\ninfection in 30 people, provides\r\nstrong evidence that the virus\r\nactually causes the disease.\r\nThough genetically different,\r\nthe two viruses appear to attack\r\nthe body in similar way, and\r\ncause identical disease,.\r\nHowever, the difference, between\r\nthe two microbes efforts to find an Aids\r\nvaccine.\r\nThe researcher, studied HIV 2\r\ninfection in 30 people from\r\nGumea-Bissau or Cape Verde.\r\nOf these, 17 had Acquired\r\nImmune Deficiency Syndrome,\r\nwhile the rest had Aids-related\r\ncomplex or no symptoms. None of\r\nthem was infected with H1V-1.\r\nIn their report, published in\r\ntoday\ufffds New England Journal of\r\nMedicine, the French researchers\r\nwrote that \ufffdit appears clear the\r\nHIV-2., a virus related to but distinct from HIV-l, is the cause of\r\nAids in some West Africa and that a new Aids epidemic (but not yet documented) in West Africa\ufffd.
