{"text": "NATION MONDAY SEPTEMBER 11, 1989\r\nLIVING WITH AIDS\r\n\r\nSays a the 36-year-old former journalist who prefers not to use his\r\nfamily name. \ufffdMy worrr is that\r\nmy children, since they re being\r\ndiscriminated against by my brothers, will not be cared for.\r\nsee a bleak future for them.\ufffd Nestor and other staff are now planning a TASO programme to ensure the welfare and education of orphans.\r\nIn hospital, fear has led some\r\nstaff to neglect Aids patients, reports Dr. Elly Katabira co-founder of TASO and head of a\r\nweekly out-patient clinic for Aids\r\npatients at Mulago Hospital.\r\nAfter he and Mrs Kaleeba were\r\ntrained in Aids counselling in the\r\nUK they visited their Ugandan\r\nclients at home. They explained\r\nthat \ufffdt was safe for family members to care for those with Aids\r\nand instructed them how to do it.\r\n\ufffdI discovered that the patients\r\nwere much happier \ufffd they were\r\nsmiling and cordial,\ufffd says Dr\r\nKatabira.\r\nTASO\ufffds aim is to help people\r\nto live with Aids and to give them\r\nhope and comfort. A positive attitude and healthy living \ufffd safe\r\nsex and no alcohol, for example \ufffd\r\nare promoted as ways to extend\r\nthe lifespan of clients.\r\nwith\r\nAs with orphans, the widows of\r\nthose who die of Aids are of special concern to TASO. Even if\r\nthey wanted to, it is difficult for\r\nthem to find husbands will accept\r\nthem. Poverty and prostitution\r\nare sometimes their fate. TASO\r\nis therefore encouraging widows\r\nto start up small income-generating enterprises for financial\r\nsecurity.\r\n\ufffdBy the way,\ufffd says Mrs. Kaleba. \ufffdI\ufffdm a widow. I lost my\r\nhusband to HIV and because of\r\nthat I\ufffdve come into contact with\r\nmany widows.\ufffd\r\nWith help from the Uganda\r\nACP and an Irish volunteer instructor, TASO has been busy\r\ntraining new counsellors and expanding its services. The head of lice covers Kampala\r\narea and, by last autumn, 10\r\nCounsellors were serving 112 client families. A second Aids clinic\r\nhas also been opened in Kampala\r\nfor mothers and babies with Aids.\r\nTASO is also expanding out\r\nside the capital. It recently\r\nopened a second branch 130 kilometres southwest of Kampala. The United States Agency for\r\nInternational Development has\r\npromised finding to setup eight\r\nmore TASO branches beginning\r\nthis summer.\r\nThe emphasis on training more.\r\nAids\r\ncounsellors is critical since blood\r\ndonors who test HIV positive\r\naren\ufffdt normally told of their status. The Ministry of Health feels\r\nthat in the absence of counselling\r\nservices, it serves no useful purpose.\r\nV ith TASO now building its\r\ncohort of counsellors, more and more cases of Aids and\r\nseropositive individuals are being\r\nreferred to it for counselling by\r\nhospitals.\r\n\ufffdThe environment is now right\r\nfor people to be told they are positive.\ufffd says Dr Edison Mworozi,\r\nwho is conducting research mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT)\r\nAids.\r\n\ufffd Organizations such as TASO are charting new waters. Their\r\nexperience and expertise should be of increasing value to other\r\ncountries and other support groups in the years to come.\r\n.
