Other\r\ncountries are paying a heavy\r\nprice for such blindness. Seven years ago the United\r\nStates reported fewer than 200\r\nAIDS cases; today there are\r\n76,670, which an estimated 1-1.5\r\nmillion infected people. Nearly\r\nhalf of these cases are concern\r\nin the states whose total\r\npopulation is less than twice that\r\nof South Africa - California and\r\nNew York.\r\nFor several years constructive\r\npreventative action in the US\r\nwas blocked blame, denied and\r\nthe seeking of scapegoats wasted\r\nprecious time.
